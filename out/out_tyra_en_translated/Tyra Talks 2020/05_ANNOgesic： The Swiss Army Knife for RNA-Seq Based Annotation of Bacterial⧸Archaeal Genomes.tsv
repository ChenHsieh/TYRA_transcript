0	11000	Today, I am very honored to invite Dr. Yu Song-Huan, our speaker, to give us an online presentation.
11000	18000	Dr. Yu Song-Huan's school and research unit is the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry.
18000	22000	His main research area is focused on bioinformatics.
22000	26000	Today, he is going to talk about the topic of
26000	34000	Energizing the Three-Arm Knife for RNA-Seq-Based Entotation of Bacterial Archaeogenomics.
34000	39000	Now, Dr. Yu Song-Huan, please introduce the topic to us.
39000	42000	Thank you for the introduction.
42000	48000	Basically, what I am going to talk about today is a tool for analyzing biological information.
48000	57000	This tool is mainly used in the analysis of large data, which is often used and very important.
57000	59000	It is mainly used in RNA sequencing.
59000	62000	Later, I will introduce the basic background.
62000	68000	We are focused on the providence of gene assistance for bacteria and fungi.
68000	74000	I believe that not all the audience comes from biology.
74000	79000	So, I will briefly introduce the background.
79000	85000	I believe that quite a few speakers have talked about the background.
85000	90000	If I am not clear enough, you can also go back and look at the part of the speakers.
90000	96000	They are all very good.
96000	104000	The whole organism needs to undergo a process of normal metabolism growth.
104000	110000	That is, all their genes need to function normally.
110000	118000	We all know that genetic material is actually stored in DNA, which is the gene we are talking about.
118000	121000	DNA is a structure of double-bone spiral.
121000	123000	You can see that there are two bones here.
124000	129000	When the DNA is copied, it will be like a zipper.
129000	131000	These two bones will be released.
131000	134000	Then one of them will be used as a template.
134000	139000	According to this template, we will have DNA polymerase.
139000	145000	It will read the genetic code above and then copy another bone to form a new DNA.
146000	151000	However, in order for the DNA to function properly,
151000	158000	in most cases, it still needs to reach the protein level.
158000	162000	There is a middle product called RNA in the middle.
162000	167000	From DNA to RNA, we call it transcription.
167000	169000	It's very simple.
169000	172000	DNA will decompose into a single bone.
172000	176000	RNA polymerase will be combined with the single-bone DNA.
176000	182000	It will read their genetic code and produce another single-bone structure.
182000	184000	We call it RNA.
184000	188000	RNA can interact with the ribosome.
188000	193000	This process is called translation.
193000	200000	These RNAs will be compared with the correct amino acid.
200000	203000	Then it will be combined into a functional protein.
203000	205000	This is the case in most cases.
205000	209000	A very important topic in recent years is that
209000	217000	biologists use big data to analyze some of the phenomena of biologics.
217000	219000	Or to understand the situation of biological manipulation.
219000	223000	We can also roughly divide it into these three levels.
223000	225000	DNA level, RNA level, and protein level.
226000	230000	These big data studies are called biologics.
230000	232000	In English, it's omics.
232000	236000	DNA can form genomics.
236000	238000	RNA has transcriptomics.
238000	240000	Protein has proteomics.
240000	242000	Basically, it's like this.
242000	243000	This is omics data.
243000	249000	They all have different levels of omics data.
250000	254000	We can study different projects at different levels.
254000	256000	Or different studies.
256000	263000	For example, if we want to know the situation of the sample we get.
263000	265000	Maybe we need to go to DNA level.
265000	268000	Let's see if there is any change in the genome.
268000	272000	If we want to see if some gene mutation
272000	277000	will cause the sample we want to study
277000	282000	to have a morphological change.
282000	284000	Then we might have to do proteomics.
284000	288000	Different omics data have different uses.
288000	292000	Different research directions.
292000	296000	Speaking of omics data, we need to talk about
296000	301000	several important technological developments in recent years.
301000	303000	This led to the emergence of omics data.
303000	306000	At the beginning, around the 1970s,
306000	308000	there was the first generation of sequencing.
308000	310000	It's mainly focused on DNA.
310000	314000	Simply put, because when DNA is copied,
314000	317000	it needs to use nucleic acids.
317000	319000	Four different nucleic acids.
319000	321000	Simply put, C, G, A, T.
321000	324000	These four different letters represent four different nucleic acids.
325000	327000	When copying these nucleic acids,
327000	330000	it should be said that in this DNA,
330000	334000	the four nucleic acids have different sequences,
334000	338000	which leads to a difference in genetic code.
338000	340000	Then different products will be produced.
340000	344000	Sanger is a scientist.
344000	350000	He used different lights to mark these four different nucleic acids.
350000	354000	So you can imagine that when this DNA is to be copied,
354000	358000	this single cell will receive these fluorescent nucleic acids.
358000	360000	After these fluorescent lights are emitted,
360000	362000	we can use this fluorescent light.
362000	365000	By detecting this fluorescent light, we can know
365000	370000	what the sequence of this gene looks like.
370000	372000	What is its genetic code?
372000	374000	Simply put, it's like this.
374000	377000	This is the first generation of sequencing.
377000	379000	The problem now is that the first generation of sequencing,
379000	381000	of course, is also used a lot.
381000	383000	Even now it is still in use.
383000	385000	But it has a few shortcomings.
385000	389000	The first one is that it can't be automated.
389000	392000	Because when we want to do this sequence,
392000	395000	we need to amplify our sample first.
395000	397000	Then we can do the sequence.
397000	398000	In the first generation,
398000	401000	it can't be automated.
401000	406000	The second one is that its genes need ...
406000	408000	There is no way to do the overall gene.
408000	412000	I can't take all the DNA out of a cell
412000	414000	and do the sequencing directly.
414000	415000	There is no way.
415000	418000	So we need to have an assumption first.
418000	421000	We know that this gene may ask
421000	422000	what we want.
422000	424000	So we do the sequence.
424000	426000	The third one is that
426000	429000	in terms of gene sequence,
429000	435000	our target gene usually has a certain length.
435000	437000	So when we do the sequence,
437000	441000	there is a high probability of error.
441000	443000	We can imagine that
443000	445000	if we have a shorter sequence,
445000	450000	there is less chance of error.
450000	453000	But if our target gene is longer,
453000	457000	there is a greater chance of error.
457000	461000	So if there are people doing experiments,
461000	462000	we know that
462000	465000	if we do the sequence again,
465000	467000	sometimes at the end,
467000	472000	there is a lot of quality drop.
472000	474000	The reason is the accumulation of error.
474000	476000	So there are these problems.
476000	477000	Although there are these problems,
477000	480000	people still use it quite often.
480000	482000	So in the early 2000s,
482000	485000	there was another one.
485000	487000	We call it Next Generation Sequencing.
487000	490000	It is to solve the shortcomings of the first generation sequence.
490000	492000	Next Generation Sequencing can be done at different levels.
492000	494000	For example, it can do DNA sequencing,
494000	496000	and it can do RNA sequencing.
496000	504000	Then it can automatically copy a large number of samples that we are interested in.
504000	506000	It's not just to get a specific gene,
506000	508000	but we can get all the genes.
508000	511000	There is no problem with sequencing.
511000	513000	So it solves this problem.
513000	514000	How does it do it?
514000	515000	It's very simple.
515000	518000	DNA and RNA are actually similar.
518000	519000	Simply put,
519000	522000	we take a cell,
522000	525000	and then we lysate the outside.
525000	528000	Then we extract the genetic material we want,
528000	530000	whether it's DNA or RNA.
530000	533000	Then we break it into pieces,
533000	535000	which is a relatively small piece,
535000	539000	usually 200 to 300 nucleic acid lengths.
539000	543000	Then we will connect the two ends with the adapter.
543000	545000	This adapter can be glued to the flow cell,
545000	547000	which is on this piece.
547000	550000	It can stick a lot of DNA.
550000	551000	After that,
551000	553000	after it is glued,
553000	554000	and then we go to the primer,
554000	557000	it can be easy to copy.
557000	561000	You can see that there is a lot of DNA here.
561000	563000	Then we use the machine to read.
563000	569000	We can know a lot of different DNA fragments at once.
569000	572000	Suddenly we may have millions,
572000	576000	even tens of millions of DNA fragments,
576000	578000	which can be sequenced by us.
578000	583000	These things are good tools for us to do analysis.
583000	586000	Maybe it's still not clear here.
586000	587000	What is it for?
587000	590000	I simply use a very simple example,
590000	594000	let everyone understand the use of this technology,
594000	596000	or its strength.
596000	597000	Simply put,
597000	598000	if we have two people today,
598000	599000	one is normal,
599000	601000	which is generally not sick,
601000	603000	nor have any bad habits.
603000	605000	The second is a person who has a smoking habit.
605000	610000	Then we go to take their genome cells,
610000	611000	then we go to take the genome,
611000	612000	then we go to take the genome,
612000	613000	then we go to do the sequencing.
613000	616000	The data we get may look like this.
616000	618000	These two are actually histograms.
618000	620000	You can imagine the height,
620000	623000	in fact, how many DNA fragments,
623000	625000	we call DNA reads,
625000	626000	it accumulates on it.
626000	627000	So the higher,
627000	629000	it means that the more DNA accumulates here.
629000	632000	It means that its performance is higher.
632000	635000	Just here there is a gene A,
635000	638000	in the case of normal people,
638000	641000	it does not have a very high level of performance.
641000	643000	But on people who have smoking,
643000	645000	it has a very high level of performance.
645000	649000	It is said that smoking will affect this gene,
649000	652000	will make this gene alive,
652000	655000	or make it perform more.
655000	657000	It may cause some diseases,
657000	659000	it may cause cancer, etc.
659000	660000	Then you compare gene B,
660000	662000	there is no such situation.
662000	665000	It is said that gene B is not the key gene.
665000	667000	Then we do not use
667000	669000	next-generation sequencing technology,
669000	671000	we may need to determine first
671000	674000	that gene A is the gene we want to study,
674000	676000	then we do the sequencing.
676000	679000	But in next-generation sequencing is different.
679000	681000	We can have no hypothesis.
681000	684000	We can do it in a data-driven way,
684000	686000	that is, we do the sequencing first.
686000	689000	We know these two people,
689000	691000	they must have something different,
691000	692000	but we do not know what gene,
692000	694000	it does not matter, we do the sequencing,
694000	695000	and then we do the comparison.
695000	696000	From this direction of comparison,
696000	699000	we can find a lot of candidates,
699000	701000	and then we do downstream analysis.
701000	703000	That is, we use next-generation sequencing,
703000	707000	we can start from hypothesis-driven,
707000	708000	sorry, I should say,
708000	712000	assumption or hypothesis-driven study,
712000	715000	into a data-driven study.
715000	717000	So that is,
717000	719000	we can use next-generation sequencing,
719000	722000	this way of big data,
722000	727000	to enhance or help us do biological research.
727000	729000	But in fact,
729000	733000	there is still a problem with this sequencing.
733000	735000	For example, we got today,
735000	737000	we finished the experiment,
737000	739000	we got our data,
739000	741000	and then we go to read.
741000	743000	We found that there are indeed two blocks,
743000	746000	it has a high level of performance.
746000	747000	Now the question is,
747000	750000	we do not know what these two blocks are.
750000	752000	If we do not know what protein it is,
752000	753000	or do not know what gene it is,
753000	756000	we can not do downstream analysis.
756000	758000	So, is it possible,
758000	760000	we directly use these sequencing,
760000	761000	what I do,
761000	762000	what I do now,
762000	765000	this tool is focused on RNA.
765000	768000	Can we directly use RNA sequencing data,
768000	770000	we automatically find out,
770000	772000	we want the genomic features.
772000	773000	Where is the gene?
773000	774000	What is this gene?
774000	775000	Where is the protein?
775000	777000	What is this protein?
777000	779000	Is there a way to do this kind of thing?
779000	780000	If so,
780000	782000	we can do downstream analysis.
782000	783000	The advantage is,
783000	784000	in fact,
784000	785000	how to say,
785000	786000	but now,
786000	787000	of course,
787000	788000	there are a lot of public databases,
788000	791000	have stored the information of these annotations.
791000	792000	In fact,
792000	794000	we can easily read it to our,
794000	796000	with our RNA sequencing to compare.
796000	797000	For example,
797000	798000	this CDS,
798000	799000	that is,
799000	800000	the meaning of coding sequence,
800000	801000	that is,
801000	802000	the meaning of protein.
802000	803000	There is a protein here.
803000	804000	Then we know,
804000	805000	this segment,
805000	807000	it is actually the protein performance.
807000	808000	OK, good.
808000	810000	But now the question is,
810000	811000	RNA sequence,
811000	812000	in fact,
812000	814000	contains or contains more information.
814000	815000	Some useful information,
815000	816000	in fact,
816000	818000	not necessarily stored in these databases.
818000	819000	The second is,
819000	821000	usually stored in these databases,
821000	823000	are the wild type,
823000	824000	sequencing,
824000	825000	or wild type,
825000	827000	wild type annotations are more.
827000	829000	But you may be in this experiment,
829000	830000	your condition is different.
830000	832000	We did some of the mutation,
832000	834000	we did some of the different training,
834000	836000	resulting in our data may be different.
836000	840000	These annotations may not necessarily be used.
841000	842000	So,
842000	843000	for example,
843000	844000	we are in this data,
844000	846000	can not see more hidden information.
846000	847000	For example,
847000	848000	here is a starting value,
848000	849000	transcript starting sign,
849000	850000	abbreviated TSS.
850000	851000	On both sides of the two sides,
851000	853000	there are 5' UTR and 3' UTR,
853000	854000	that is,
854000	855000	will not be transferred out of the region.
855000	856000	Look here,
856000	859000	there is actually a section of the transfer block,
859000	860000	but only here is the protein,
860000	861000	that is,
861000	862000	this section and this section,
862000	864000	will not be transferred into protein.
864000	865000	But recently,
865000	866000	a lot of research has been found,
866000	867000	in fact,
867000	868000	these two blocks,
868000	869000	it may be some,
869000	870000	uh,
870000	871000	controlled protein,
871000	872000	where they will interact,
872000	874000	it will affect the later protein transfer.
874000	876000	This is a very important block,
876000	878000	but most databases
878000	880000	will not provide this information.
880000	881000	There is another one here,
881000	883000	very high expression of the block,
883000	886000	that may be a non-coding RNA,
886000	888000	we will introduce this thing in detail later.
888000	890000	In terms of cells,
890000	893000	we call it small non-coding RNA or SRA.
893000	894000	So,
894000	895000	is there any way we can
895000	896000	integrate these
896000	898000	multiple genomic features,
898000	899000	and then we will produce a
899000	901000	high-quality annotation
901000	902000	to help everyone,
902000	904000	so that users can use it?
904000	905000	And is it possible to customize,
905000	906000	that is,
906000	907000	what is my RNA sequence,
907000	909000	based on my sequence data
909000	911000	to do annotation?
911000	912000	Is it possible
912000	914000	that we can not only know these genes,
914000	916000	we can also know its function?
916000	918000	These questions are our motivation
918000	920000	to design this tool.
920000	922000	In fact, there are many,
922000	923000	in fact, there are many tools
923000	924000	that can do these,
924000	925000	uh,
925000	926000	do annotation.
926000	927000	But they all have some,
927000	928000	uh,
928000	929000	shortcomings.
929000	930000	Most of the tools,
930000	931000	they are all based on
931000	932000	genome sequence.
932000	933000	What does it mean?
933000	934000	That is, they only refer to
934000	935000	this,
935000	936000	there are some,
936000	937000	uh,
937000	938000	for example,
938000	939000	we do bacteria,
939000	940000	some bacteria,
940000	941000	it already knows
941000	943000	what the gene code looks like.
943000	945000	So it only based on this gene code,
945000	946000	and then do the analysis.
946000	947000	It will not look at
947000	949000	how many reads to,
949000	950000	to, uh,
950000	951000	compare to the position we want,
951000	952000	or the gene we want,
952000	953000	these information,
953000	954000	it will not consider.
954000	955000	So it leads to,
955000	957000	this prediction,
957000	958000	uh,
958000	959000	things are not necessarily
959000	960000	in line with our needs,
960000	961000	and the accuracy rate is usually
961000	963000	not so high.
963000	964000	The second,
964000	966000	they also lack a systematic comparison.
966000	967000	For example,
967000	968000	we use a tool,
968000	969000	we go,
969000	970000	uh,
970000	971000	to predict,
971000	972000	uh,
972000	973000	a part of the starting point,
973000	974000	and then we use another tool,
974000	975000	we go to predict,
975000	976000	this,
976000	977000	the part of the terminus.
977000	978000	As a result,
978000	979000	we find that these two
979000	980000	predict the result
980000	981000	is contradictory.
981000	982000	Often there is such a thing
982000	983000	to happen.
983000	984000	That is to say,
984000	985000	they will not systematically
985000	986000	to compare.
986000	987000	Okay.
987000	988000	So this is,
988000	989000	uh,
989000	990000	we want to do this,
990000	991000	the reason for the analgesic,
991000	992000	uh,
992000	993000	it is the first tool,
993000	994000	we are using RNA sequencing,
994000	995000	the data,
995000	996000	to do the genome notation.
996000	997000	That is especially for bacteria,
998000	1001000	and archaea research.
1001000	1002000	Now introduce the analgesic,
1002000	1003000	this tool,
1003000	1004000	uh,
1004000	1005000	its several features,
1005000	1007000	the first is that we can
1007000	1009000	analyze different protocols,
1009000	1011000	RNA sequencing data.
1011000	1012000	RNA sequencing,
1012000	1013000	it has a lot of different protocols,
1013000	1015000	in order to do different purposes.
1015000	1016000	Uh,
1016000	1017000	we can,
1017000	1018000	we integrate
1018000	1019000	many different
1019000	1021000	RNA sequencing protocols.
1021000	1022000	The second,
1022000	1023000	we compare a lot of existing,
1023000	1024000	uh,
1024000	1025000	biological information tool.
1025000	1026000	Then,
1026000	1027000	we do the combination,
1027000	1028000	even,
1028000	1029000	we do,
1029000	1031000	the optimization of variables.
1031000	1032000	Then,
1032000	1033000	we even,
1033000	1034000	if some of the,
1034000	1035000	uh,
1035000	1036000	methods are not too good,
1036000	1037000	we do improve.
1037000	1039000	If the features we want,
1039000	1040000	it does not have,
1040000	1042000	the existing tool can predict,
1042000	1045000	then we will create a new one.
1045000	1047000	This is a modular tool,
1047000	1048000	that is to say,
1048000	1049000	it is very flexible.
1049000	1050000	The user can,
1050000	1052000	for their own needs,
1052000	1053000	and then build,
1053000	1055000	build the tool you want,
1055000	1057000	and then do the analysis.
1057000	1058000	Then,
1058000	1060000	the interface is consistent.
1060000	1061000	Finally,
1061000	1063000	we will also provide some statistics,
1063000	1065000	and visualization,
1065000	1066000	so that everyone can see,
1066000	1067000	to analyze,
1067000	1068000	your,
1068000	1069000	uh,
1069000	1070000	generated notation,
1070000	1072000	some accuracy,
1072000	1074000	and information.
1074000	1075000	So,
1075000	1076000	the overall purpose is,
1076000	1078000	we hope to be able to produce a,
1078000	1079000	systematized,
1079000	1081000	and high-quality notation,
1081000	1083000	and then be able to include,
1083000	1085000	different genomic features,
1085000	1086000	and then let the user can,
1086000	1087000	overall,
1087000	1088000	to see,
1088000	1090000	to analyze their data.
1090000	1091000	Simply put,
1091000	1092000	for example,
1092000	1093000	Lego,
1093000	1094000	piece by piece,
1094000	1095000	Lego piece,
1095000	1096000	that is,
1096000	1097000	RNA sequencing reads.
1097000	1098000	Then,
1098000	1099000	of course,
1099000	1100000	we can add other information,
1100000	1101000	but it is not necessary.
1101000	1102000	After that,
1102000	1103000	we can assemble,
1103000	1105000	into a variety of different models.
1105000	1106000	These models,
1106000	1107000	can be tailored to the user's needs,
1107000	1108000	you can assemble,
1108000	1109000	the model you want,
1109000	1111000	and then do your prediction.
1111000	1112000	In the end,
1112000	1113000	it will give you a,
1113000	1115000	high-quality notation.
1115000	1116000	At present,
1116000	1117000	Jessica has been able to predict,
1117000	1119000	more than 20 different features,
1119000	1120000	the accuracy rate,
1120000	1122000	is about 80% or more.
1122000	1123000	Today,
1123000	1125000	because it is impossible to introduce so much,
1125000	1126000	we will focus on a few,
1126000	1127000	core features,
1127000	1128000	to introduce to everyone.
1128000	1129000	These features,
1129000	1131000	these core features,
1131000	1132000	in fact,
1132000	1133000	we often use,
1133000	1135000	to predict other things,
1135000	1138000	a core.
1138000	1139000	Before introducing,
1139000	1140000	Jessica,
1140000	1142000	introduced two protocols,
1142000	1144000	two RNA sequencing protocols.
1144000	1145000	These two sequencing,
1145000	1146000	to do annotation,
1146000	1148000	is very helpful.
1148000	1149000	Of course,
1149000	1151000	if the audience of biologists,
1151000	1152000	if you want to directly use,
1152000	1154000	traditional RNA sequencing,
1154000	1155000	to do analysis,
1155000	1157000	there is no problem at all.
1157000	1158000	It's just that we think,
1158000	1159000	these two protocols,
1159000	1161000	can help to do annotation.
1161000	1162000	The first one is,
1162000	1163000	Differential RNA Sequencing,
1163000	1164000	called D-RNA-Seq.
1164000	1165000	In fact,
1165000	1167000	the number of applications is also very wide.
1167000	1168000	Simply put,
1168000	1169000	RNA reads,
1169000	1171000	it can be divided into two different types.
1171000	1173000	One is called Primary Transcript,
1173000	1174000	that is,
1174000	1175000	Triphosphate Binds,
1175000	1176000	at the front.
1176000	1178000	The second is called Processing RNA,
1178000	1179000	that is,
1179000	1181000	it does not have Triphosphate Binding.
1181000	1182000	What is Primary Transcript?
1182000	1184000	If you look at this picture,
1184000	1185000	this red line,
1185000	1186000	is actually reads.
1186000	1187000	That is,
1187000	1188000	it is in this,
1188000	1190000	will shift the starting value,
1190000	1191000	part.
1191000	1193000	If it is included in the starting value,
1193000	1194000	it will have this Triphosphate,
1194000	1195000	here.
1195000	1196000	If not,
1196000	1197000	like these,
1197000	1198000	these five different,
1198000	1199000	these five reads,
1199000	1201000	it is the middle part.
1201000	1202000	OK.
1202000	1203000	Then we add an element,
1203000	1204000	called Tags.
1204000	1206000	It will degrade the Processing RNA.
1206000	1207000	So,
1207000	1210000	with no Tag Tree Library,
1210000	1212000	its Primary Transcript,
1212000	1213000	and Processing RNA,
1213000	1215000	the ratio will not change.
1215000	1216000	But in Tag Tree Library,
1216000	1217000	the whole ratio,
1217000	1218000	Primary Transcript,
1218000	1219000	the ratio will be,
1219000	1220000	will be Enriched,
1220000	1221000	will be improved.
1221000	1223000	So when we do RNA Sequencing,
1223000	1225000	we compare these two libraries,
1225000	1226000	we will find that,
1226000	1227000	at the starting point,
1227000	1229000	this Tag Tree Library,
1229000	1230000	will be significantly,
1230000	1232000	higher than the Non-Tag Tree Library.
1232000	1234000	This will allow us,
1234000	1235000	to quickly determine,
1235000	1237000	where is the starting point,
1237000	1239000	the starting point of the transition.
1239000	1240000	If we know the starting point of the transition,
1240000	1242000	it can help us to determine,
1242000	1243000	there will be,
1243000	1245000	there may be some genes,
1245000	1247000	there may be some UTRs,
1247000	1249000	some very important information.
1249000	1250000	OK.
1250000	1251000	And this Resolution is very high,
1251000	1253000	can go to Single Neutral Type.
1253000	1255000	The second Protocol is,
1255000	1257000	RNA Sequencing with Transcript Fragmentation.
1257000	1258000	General RNA Molecule,
1258000	1259000	is about what I just said,
1259000	1261000	about 200 to 300 Nucleotides.
1261000	1262000	If we do directly,
1262000	1263000	sequencing,
1263000	1264000	this situation will often occur,
1264000	1266000	that is, we will lose,
1266000	1267000	3'N,
1267000	1268000	that is, the end of the information.
1268000	1269000	What is the reason?
1269000	1271000	Because our reads,
1271000	1272000	as I just said,
1272000	1273000	the longer the length,
1273000	1274000	the higher the probability of error,
1274000	1276000	or the higher the accumulation rate.
1276000	1277000	In order to,
1277000	1279000	sometimes the error,
1279000	1281000	the error ratio reaches a certain level,
1281000	1282000	we are very difficult to use these,
1282000	1284000	to help these reads to detect,
1284000	1285000	it is in,
1285000	1286000	which position of the genome.
1286000	1287000	Because,
1287000	1288000	this score,
1288000	1289000	the score of the mapping is not high.
1289000	1291000	So, when we are doing the mapping,
1291000	1292000	we will do a Quality Trimming,
1292000	1293000	is to put these,
1293000	1294000	error rate,
1294000	1296000	or when doing sequencing,
1296000	1298000	the quality is relatively poor,
1298000	1299000	we cut it off,
1299000	1300000	remove it,
1300000	1301000	and then only use the remaining part,
1301000	1302000	to do the sequencing.
1302000	1303000	Because it was cut off,
1303000	1305000	so 3'N information,
1305000	1306000	will be lost.
1306000	1308000	If we do a,
1308000	1309000	Fragmentation,
1309000	1311000	to make this RNA reads shorter,
1311000	1313000	usually we will set to 80 to 100.
1313000	1315000	At this time,
1315000	1316000	it will make this,
1316000	1319000	the number of neutrophils that have been sacrificed,
1319000	1320000	can be reduced.
1320000	1322000	That will make us able to,
1322000	1325000	detect the whole gene transcription location,
1325000	1327000	from the beginning to the end,
1327000	1328000	maybe we can detect it.
1328000	1330000	This can help us to see,
1330000	1332000	which are the real areas,
1332000	1333000	this transition,
1333000	1334000	where is the transition area.
1334000	1336000	OK, those are the two protocols.
1336000	1337000	OK,
1337000	1338000	to enter this,
1338000	1339000	our core feature,
1339000	1341000	our most important feature,
1341000	1342000	called Transcript Boundary Detection.
1342000	1343000	Because if we do not know,
1343000	1345000	where is the boundary,
1345000	1347000	we certainly have no way,
1347000	1349000	to easily judge,
1349000	1351000	the location of this gene,
1351000	1352000	or its length.
1352000	1354000	So the boundary is very important.
1354000	1355000	This is the starting point,
1355000	1356000	TSS,
1356000	1357000	as we just said,
1357000	1359000	if we have the RNA-seq,
1359000	1360000	we can easily judge,
1360000	1361000	this place.
1361000	1362000	Then,
1362000	1364000	this is more common,
1364000	1365000	we often use,
1365000	1367000	biological data analysis tool,
1367000	1368000	there are three,
1368000	1369000	called TSS Predictor,
1369000	1370000	TSS-SAR,
1370000	1371000	TSS-SAR.
1371000	1372000	Then we have,
1372000	1373000	after comparison,
1373000	1374000	found that TSS Predictor,
1374000	1375000	is the best,
1375000	1376000	the highest accuracy tool.
1376000	1378000	But the problem is,
1378000	1380000	it has a lot of parameters,
1380000	1382000	and its parameters are very sensitive.
1382000	1383000	If we change a little bit,
1383000	1384000	the whole result,
1384000	1386000	will be very different.
1386000	1387000	So we have to do,
1387000	1388000	optimization.
1388000	1389000	Then,
1389000	1390000	I will introduce this part,
1390000	1391000	below later.
1391000	1392000	Terminator,
1392000	1393000	is the terminal part,
1393000	1394000	there is a very common tool,
1394000	1396000	called TrenternHP.
1396000	1397000	This tool,
1397000	1398000	but it has a shortcoming,
1398000	1399000	that is,
1399000	1400000	it only uses,
1400000	1401000	genome sequence,
1401000	1402000	to do,
1402000	1403000	reference sequence,
1403000	1404000	to do predictions.
1404000	1405000	So the accuracy is not too high,
1405000	1407000	so we also made some improvements.
1407000	1408000	Then,
1408000	1409000	if,
1409000	1410000	our,
1410000	1411000	sample,
1411000	1412000	in,
1412000	1413000	database,
1413000	1414000	has stored,
1414000	1415000	the information of the protein,
1415000	1416000	we can directly read.
1416000	1417000	If not,
1417000	1418000	we can use,
1418000	1419000	RET,
1419000	1420000	this tool,
1420000	1421000	it can,
1421000	1422000	this,
1422000	1423000	use,
1423000	1424000	clean source,
1424000	1425000	and,
1425000	1426000	annotation,
1426000	1427000	sample,
1427000	1428000	or,
1428000	1429000	how to say,
1429000	1430000	species.
1430000	1431000	Then,
1431000	1432000	we transfer it,
1432000	1433000	to our target,
1433000	1434000	species.
1434000	1435000	Then,
1435000	1436000	we have,
1436000	1437000	this,
1437000	1438000	just mentioned,
1438000	1439000	fragmentation,
1439000	1440000	RNA sequence,
1440000	1441000	we can also easily,
1441000	1442000	read,
1442000	1443000	where is transcript.
1443000	1444000	Then,
1444000	1445000	finally,
1445000	1446000	we compare,
1446000	1447000	we have starting value,
1447000	1448000	we have protein value,
1448000	1449000	we have transcript,
1449000	1450000	we have terminator,
1450000	1451000	naturally,
1452000	1453000	then this is,
1453000	1454000	simply to see,
1454000	1455000	how we can achieve,
1455000	1456000	Boundary.
1456000	1457000	Then,
1457000	1458000	let's take a closer look at,
1458000	1459000	these,
1459000	1460000	feature prediction.
1460000	1461000	The first one is,
1461000	1462000	TSS.
1462000	1463000	I just said,
1463000	1464000	TSS,
1464000	1465000	is,
1465000	1466000	tool,
1466000	1467000	is TSS predictor.
1467000	1468000	Then,
1468000	1469000	in order to do,
1469000	1470000	parameter optimization,
1470000	1471000	we use,
1471000	1472000	a machine learning based,
1472000	1473000	optimization method,
1473000	1474000	called,
1474000	1475000	Genetic Algorithm.
1475000	1476000	Genetic Algorithm,
1476000	1477000	this is morphology,
1477000	1478000	I will introduce later.
1478000	1479000	Simply put,
1479000	1480000	Genetic Algorithm,
1480000	1481000	uses,
1481000	1482000	two different,
1482000	1483000	changes,
1483000	1484000	to achieve,
1484000	1485000	the purpose of optimization.
1485000	1486000	Simply put,
1486000	1487000	for example,
1487000	1488000	we have,
1488000	1489000	today,
1489000	1490000	this black line,
1490000	1491000	represents,
1491000	1492000	all the results,
1492000	1493000	that is,
1493000	1494000	all of our,
1494000	1495000	parameter,
1495000	1496000	array combination,
1496000	1497000	all the results,
1497000	1498000	are just,
1498000	1499000	make up this line,
1499000	1500000	every point,
1500000	1501000	it is a,
1501000	1502000	parameter result.
1502000	1503000	Then,
1503000	1504000	the lower part,
1504000	1505000	means the worse,
1505000	1506000	the performance is worse,
1506000	1507000	the higher the performance,
1507000	1508000	the better.
1508000	1509000	Then,
1509000	1510000	we will,
1510000	1511000	randomly choose,
1511000	1512000	a point,
1512000	1513000	then,
1513000	1514000	we may,
1514000	1515000	add one,
1515000	1516000	then we find,
1516000	1517000	oh,
1517000	1518000	two results,
1518000	1519000	better than one,
1519000	1520000	we keep two,
1520000	1521000	then we add one,
1521000	1522000	find three,
1522000	1523000	better than two,
1523000	1524000	so we keep three,
1524000	1525000	this traditional,
1525000	1526000	algorithmic method,
1526000	1527000	keep doing,
1527000	1528000	will do this point,
1528000	1529000	right?
1529000	1530000	Then we add one,
1530000	1531000	we will find,
1531000	1532000	hey,
1532000	1533000	the result,
1533000	1534000	seems not as good as before,
1534000	1535000	we will leave the previous,
1535000	1536000	then we will keep doing,
1536000	1537000	will find,
1537000	1538000	not as good as this,
1538000	1539000	this is the best,
1539000	1540000	optimized point,
1540000	1541000	but we,
1541000	1542000	there is another point,
1542000	1543000	actually better than it,
1543000	1544000	then we,
1544000	1545000	so it can not,
1545000	1546000	really find,
1546000	1547000	optimization,
1547000	1548000	what is the optimized part,
1548000	1549000	how,
1549000	1550000	that,
1550000	1551000	genetic algorithm,
1551000	1552000	what is the concept,
1552000	1553000	that is,
1553000	1554000	we also,
1554000	1555000	randomly take a point,
1555000	1556000	but we have a,
1556000	1557000	huge change,
1557000	1558000	that huge change,
1558000	1559000	will randomly,
1559000	1560000	run,
1560000	1561000	assign parameter,
1561000	1562000	so you do not know,
1562000	1563000	run to where,
1563000	1564000	may run to this point,
1564000	1565000	then we find,
1565000	1566000	hey,
1566000	1567000	better than this,
1567000	1568000	then,
1568000	1569000	next,
1569000	1570000	we adjust a macro,
1570000	1571000	add 1,
1571000	1572000	we find,
1572000	1573000	3,
1573000	1574000	better than 2,
1574000	1575000	we take 3,
1575000	1576000	then add 1,
1576000	1577000	add 1,
1577000	1578000	add 1,
1578000	1579000	naturally,
1579000	1580000	we will slowly run here,
1580000	1581000	so simply,
1581000	1582000	that is,
1582000	1583000	through this global change,
1583000	1584000	we can help us find,
1584000	1585000	global optimization,
1585000	1586000	that,
1586000	1587000	macro adjustment,
1587000	1588000	help us find,
1588000	1589000	local optimization,
1589000	1590000	so that,
1590000	1591000	after we combine the two,
1591000	1592000	we can find,
1592000	1593000	the best,
1593000	1594000	optimization method,
1594000	1595000	that because,
1595000	1596000	TSS predictor,
1596000	1597000	too much,
1597000	1598000	so,
1598000	1599000	we,
1599000	1600000	transform a little bit,
1600000	1601000	this,
1601000	1602000	genetic algorithm,
1602000	1603000	that is,
1603000	1604000	we have one more step,
1604000	1605000	we have a global change,
1605000	1606000	that is,
1606000	1607000	we randomly assign,
1607000	1608000	all parameters,
1608000	1609000	that,
1609000	1610000	we do evaluation,
1610000	1611000	then,
1611000	1612000	we only take a few parameters,
1612000	1613000	to change,
1613000	1614000	the same,
1614000	1615000	randomly assign,
1615000	1616000	a few,
1616000	1617000	not all,
1617000	1618000	that,
1618000	1619000	will be large change,
1619000	1620000	then,
1620000	1621000	we do evaluation,
1621000	1622000	then,
1622000	1623000	we do macro,
1623000	1624000	then do evaluation,
1624000	1625000	so,
1626000	1627000	we will get,
1627000	1628000	our optimized parameters,
1628000	1629000	OK,
1629000	1630000	that,
1630000	1631000	this is our result,
1631000	1632000	we use,
1632000	1633000	in three different,
1633000	1634000	bacteria,
1634000	1635000	bacteria,
1635000	1636000	bacteria,
1636000	1637000	and so on,
1637000	1638000	we will find,
1638000	1639000	that,
1639000	1640000	after optimization,
1640000	1641000	the sensitivity,
1641000	1642000	are largely,
1642000	1643000	have increased,
1643000	1644000	especially,
1644000	1645000	this,
1645000	1646000	we have increased,
1646000	1647000	about 30% sensitivity,
1647000	1648000	that,
1648000	1649000	in the specificity part,
1649000	1650000	it is difficult to see,
1650000	1651000	what changes,
1651000	1652000	the main reason,
1652000	1653000	is because,
1653000	1654000	data sets,
1654000	1655000	this,
1655000	1656000	this,
1656000	1657000	bacteria,
1657000	1658000	may have 100,
1658000	1659000	nucleic acid,
1659000	1660000	but its starting value,
1660000	1661000	may be only 1000,
1661000	1662000	that is to say,
1662000	1663000	there are more than 900,000,
1663000	1664000	nucleotide,
1664000	1665000	it is actually,
1665000	1666000	not the starting value,
1666000	1667000	so it is 900,000,
1667000	1668000	than 1000,
1668000	1669000	this is very,
1669000	1670000	unbalanced,
1670000	1671000	will lead to,
1671000	1672000	its specificity,
1672000	1673000	has always been very high,
1673000	1674000	because you,
1674000	1675000	as long as you,
1675000	1676000	always say,
1676000	1677000	it is not the starting value,
1677000	1678000	it is actually,
1678000	1679000	prediction accuracy,
1679000	1680000	is also very high,
1680000	1681000	so,
1681000	1682000	this is the problem,
1682000	1683000	but,
1683000	1684000	the number of,
1684000	1685000	golden grape bacteria,
1685000	1686000	here,
1686000	1687000	has dropped,
1687000	1688000	about 2000,
1688000	1689000	we can,
1689000	1690000	remove 2000,
1690000	1691000	nucleotide,
1691000	1692000	ok,
1692000	1693000	this is,
1693000	1694000	the starting value part,
1694000	1695000	let's look at,
1695000	1696000	this transcript,
1696000	1697000	is the part of the transition block,
1697000	1698000	because,
1698000	1699000	we have sequencing data,
1699000	1700000	so,
1700000	1701000	we can easily,
1701000	1702000	see,
1702000	1703000	its,
1703000	1704000	gene performance,
1704000	1705000	so,
1705000	1706000	we can set,
1706000	1707000	a cut-off,
1707000	1708000	as long as,
1708000	1709000	higher than this cut-off,
1709000	1710000	we will determine,
1710000	1711000	we will determine,
1711000	1712000	it has performance,
1712000	1713000	so,
1713000	1714000	the reason for the cut-off,
1714000	1715000	is actually,
1715000	1716000	some mapping,
1716000	1717000	it is noise,
1717000	1718000	it is random mapping,
1718000	1719000	so,
1719000	1720000	we do not need to deduct these parts,
1720000	1721000	so,
1721000	1722000	we set a cut-off for it,
1722000	1723000	then,
1723000	1724000	in addition,
1724000	1725000	we also set a tolerance,
1725000	1726000	that is,
1726000	1727000	if this performance,
1727000	1728000	has a,
1728000	1729000	temporary,
1729000	1730000	short-term decline,
1730000	1731000	we can tolerate,
1731000	1732000	then,
1732000	1733000	we can connect,
1733000	1734000	a few,
1734000	1735000	transcripts,
1735000	1736000	out,
1736000	1737000	then,
1737000	1738000	we can compare,
1738000	1739000	with our genes,
1739000	1740000	because usually,
1740000	1741000	a gene,
1741000	1742000	so,
1742000	1743000	we can use,
1743000	1744000	this gene,
1744000	1745000	information,
1745000	1746000	to help us,
1746000	1747000	to connect,
1747000	1748000	this is,
1748000	1749000	we do,
1749000	1750000	this,
1750000	1751000	transcript,
1751000	1752000	block,
1752000	1753000	this,
1753000	1754000	prediction,
1754000	1755000	way,
1755000	1756000	then,
1756000	1757000	finally,
1757000	1758000	talk about,
1758000	1759000	this,
1759000	1760000	terminal,
1760000	1761000	then,
1761000	1762000	actually,
1762000	1763000	terminal,
1763000	1764000	there is,
1764000	1765000	a common tool,
1765000	1766000	called,
1766000	1767000	TrenturnHP,
1767000	1768000	but,
1768000	1769000	we found,
1769000	1770000	when we use,
1770000	1771000	very intuitively,
1771000	1772000	to,
1772000	1773000	to judge,
1773000	1774000	if this is,
1774000	1775000	a terminal,
1775000	1776000	point,
1776000	1777000	then,
1777000	1778000	its performance,
1778000	1779000	should be,
1779000	1780000	significantly,
1780000	1781000	down,
1781000	1782000	or end,
1782000	1783000	is no longer,
1783000	1784000	right,
1784000	1785000	so,
1785000	1786000	we went to see,
1786000	1787000	this highest point,
1787000	1788000	and the lowest point,
1788000	1789000	it should have,
1789000	1790000	a decreasing,
1790000	1791000	if there is,
1791000	1792000	we say,
1792000	1793000	this is the correct,
1793000	1794000	terminators,
1794000	1795000	but,
1795000	1796000	the problem is,
1796000	1797000	some,
1797000	1798000	TrenturnHP,
1798000	1799000	it predicts,
1799000	1800000	this terminator,
1800000	1801000	or,
1801000	1802000	it is false,
1802000	1803000	or,
1803000	1804000	it is in this,
1804000	1805000	uh,
1805000	1806000	condition,
1806000	1807000	in this sample,
1807000	1808000	it has no effect,
1808000	1809000	or,
1809000	1810000	there is no performance,
1810000	1811000	this,
1811000	1812000	basically,
1812000	1813000	this CDS,
1813000	1814000	has no performance,
1814000	1815000	then,
1815000	1816000	this terminator,
1816000	1817000	naturally,
1817000	1818000	has no function,
1818000	1819000	so,
1819000	1820000	by this way,
1820000	1821000	we can increase,
1821000	1822000	our specificity,
1822000	1823000	then,
1823000	1824000	we can remove,
1824000	1825000	some of the,
1825000	1826000	but,
1826000	1827000	how do we increase,
1827000	1828000	sensitivity,
1828000	1829000	uh,
1829000	1830000	for example,
1830000	1831000	if today,
1831000	1832000	we have two proteins,
1832000	1833000	uh,
1833000	1834000	it,
1834000	1835000	the direction is relative,
1835000	1836000	then,
1836000	1837000	naturally,
1837000	1838000	there should be,
1838000	1839000	a terminal,
1839000	1840000	otherwise,
1840000	1841000	it will be like this,
1841000	1842000	turn,
1842000	1843000	turn,
1843000	1844000	turn,
1844000	1845000	turn,
1845000	1846000	turn,
1846000	1847000	turn,
1847000	1848000	turn,
1848000	1849000	turn,
1849000	1850000	turn,
1850000	1851000	turn,
1851000	1852000	turn,
1852000	1853000	turn,
1853000	1854000	turn,
1854000	1855000	turn,
1855000	1856000	turn,
1856000	1857000	turn,
1857000	1858000	there's hairpin loop,
1858000	1859000	we're talking,
1859000	1860000	about hairpin,
1860000	1861000	so,
1861000	1862000	it has two-level structure,
1862000	1863000	very stable,
1863000	1864000	so,
1864000	1865000	we're going to search,
1865000	1866000	this part,
1866000	1867000	this position,
1867000	1868000	this,
1868000	1870000	the middle of two proteins,
1870000	1871000	do we have,
1871000	1872000	this two-level structure,
1872000	1873000	if yes,
1873000	1874000	then,
1874000	1875000	uh,
1875000	1876000	this,
1876000	1877000	performance,
1877000	1878000	this RNA,
1878000	1879000	and sequencing the,
1879000	1880000	this performance,
1880000	1881000	and there are these,
1881000	1882000	deterioration pattern,
1882000	1883000	we will judgment,
1883000	1884000	it is a terminator,
1884000	1885000	then,
1885000	1886000	thus,
1886000	1887000	the sensitivity,
1887000	1888000	so,
1888000	1889000	the whole terminator,
1889000	1890000	prediction accuracy,
1890000	1891000	can be mentioned,
1891000	1892000	about 80% or so,
1892000	1893000	good,
1893000	1894000	then,
1894000	1895000	this is our,
1895000	1896000	a real example,
1896000	1897000	this is,
1897000	1898000	uh,
1898000	1899000	a golden grape ball,
1899000	1900000	an example,
1900000	1901000	you can see,
1901000	1902000	the red,
1902000	1903000	this histogram,
1903000	1904000	it is,
1904000	1905000	we're talking about,
1905000	1906000	fragmentation RNA-seq,
1906000	1907000	you can see,
1907000	1908000	it covers,
1908000	1909000	the whole transcript,
1909000	1910000	can cover,
1910000	1911000	this block,
1911000	1912000	then,
1912000	1913000	general RNA sequencing,
1913000	1914000	this is differential RNA sequencing,
1914000	1915000	you can see,
1915000	1916000	this information,
1916000	1917000	good,
1917000	1918000	then,
1918000	1919000	we just talked about,
1919000	1920000	this dRNA-seq,
1920000	1921000	through this text tree,
1921000	1922000	and non-text tree comparison,
1922000	1923000	we can know,
1923000	1924000	TSS,
1924000	1925000	uh,
1925000	1926000	where is the starting point,
1926000	1927000	you can see,
1927000	1928000	obviously,
1928000	1929000	there is a text tree library,
1929000	1930000	obviously,
1930000	1931000	higher than non-text tree library,
1931000	1932000	so,
1932000	1933000	this is a TSS,
1933000	1934000	here,
1934000	1935000	then,
1935000	1936000	we use,
1936000	1937000	terminator prediction,
1937000	1938000	we find TSS,
1938000	1939000	terminator is here,
1939000	1940000	then,
1940000	1941000	CDS,
1941000	1942000	protein is here,
1942000	1943000	then,
1943000	1944000	naturally,
1944000	1945000	then,
1945000	1946000	with this feature,
1946000	1947000	we can,
1947000	1948000	extend,
1948000	1949000	to predict more things,
1949000	1950000	for example,
1950000	1951000	we can predict,
1951000	1952000	where is the transition,
1952000	1953000	where is the operon,
1953000	1954000	you can see,
1954000	1955000	for example,
1955000	1956000	this example,
1956000	1957000	there is a transcript,
1957000	1959000	there is a whole transition block,
1959000	1960000	then,
1960000	1961000	there are two proteins in this block,
1961000	1962000	meaning,
1962000	1963000	these two proteins,
1963000	1964000	they are together,
1964000	1966000	transferred and transferred,
1966000	1967000	so,
1967000	1968000	these two proteins,
1968000	1969000	it is possible,
1969000	1970000	they are related in public use,
1970000	1971000	then,
1971000	1973000	we can also find promoter,
1973000	1974000	then,
1974000	1975000	promoter,
1975000	1976000	it will accelerate,
1976000	1977000	or promote,
1977000	1978000	this,
1978000	1979000	we do the transition,
1979000	1980000	this,
1980000	1981000	this,
1981000	1982000	process,
1982000	1983000	so,
1983000	1984000	usually,
1984000	1985000	it is in TSS,
1985000	1986000	which is the front of the starting point,
1986000	1987000	about 35 to 50,
1987000	1988000	this nucleic acid,
1988000	1989000	this position,
1989000	1990000	so,
1990000	1991000	when we,
1991000	1992000	we already have TSS information,
1992000	1993000	naturally,
1993000	1994000	we can extract,
1994000	1995000	extract the front,
1995000	1996000	or extract the front,
1996000	1997000	these sequences,
1997000	1998000	then,
1998000	1999000	we do,
1999000	2000000	this,
2000000	2001000	this promoter,
2001000	2002000	analysis,
2002000	2003000	then,
2003000	2004000	we can find,
2004000	2005000	oh,
2005000	2006000	indeed,
2006000	2007000	it has a very specific,
2007000	2008000	sequence,
2008000	2009000	code,
2009000	2010000	TA,
2010000	2011000	TAAT,
2011000	2012000	this,
2012000	2013000	in bacteria,
2013000	2014000	we call it pre-know box,
2014000	2015000	it is a promoter,
2015000	2016000	ok,
2016000	2017000	good,
2017000	2018000	now,
2018000	2019000	we have,
2019000	2020000	this,
2020000	2021000	transcript boundary,
2021000	2022000	then,
2022000	2023000	sometimes,
2023000	2024000	it is very interesting,
2024000	2025000	that is,
2025000	2026000	what we just said at the beginning,
2026000	2027000	sometimes,
2027000	2028000	we will find,
2028000	2029000	it has a very high expression block,
2029000	2030000	but,
2030000	2031000	it is not a protein,
2031000	2032000	so,
2032000	2033000	this is a very common,
2033000	2034000	a topic,
2034000	2035000	called non-coding RNA,
2035000	2036000	no matter in which field,
2036000	2037000	you do nucleation,
2037000	2038000	you do,
2038000	2039000	cell,
2039000	2040000	bacteria,
2040000	2041000	will,
2041000	2042000	will be involved,
2042000	2043000	will want to do this,
2043000	2044000	what is non-coding RNA,
2044000	2045000	that is,
2045000	2046000	we just said,
2046000	2047000	traditional,
2047000	2048000	in fact,
2048000	2049000	it should be DNA,
2049000	2050000	into RNA,
2050000	2051000	RNA into protein,
2051000	2052000	but,
2052000	2053000	there is,
2053000	2054000	there is a special case,
2054000	2055000	that is,
2055000	2056000	DNA into,
2056000	2057000	into RNA,
2057000	2058000	it will produce,
2058000	2059000	a very interesting,
2059000	2060000	secondary structure,
2060000	2061000	that is,
2061000	2062000	it can interact,
2062000	2063000	it can interact with,
2063000	2064000	with this RNA,
2064000	2065000	it can control,
2065000	2066000	a lot of different things,
2066000	2067000	you can see,
2067000	2068000	in,
2068000	2069000	in this bacteria,
2069000	2070000	in the research of,
2070000	2071000	Sermal RNA,
2071000	2072000	from 2000 to,
2072000	2073000	2000,
2073000	2074000	2016,
2074000	2075000	this publication,
2075000	2076000	the number,
2076000	2077000	is an increase in the number,
2077000	2078000	say,
2078000	2079000	it is a very important,
2079000	2080000	topic,
2080000	2081000	so,
2081000	2082000	we use,
2082000	2083000	analgesic,
2083000	2084000	you can also read,
2084000	2085000	non-coding RNA,
2085000	2086000	how to do it,
2086000	2087000	because,
2087000	2088000	non-coding RNA,
2088000	2089000	in it,
2089000	2090000	there is a type,
2090000	2091000	this type,
2091000	2092000	we can use an example later,
2092000	2093000	very simple,
2093000	2094000	let everyone see,
2094000	2095000	that simply speaking,
2095000	2096000	that is,
2096000	2097000	intergenic,
2097000	2098000	the,
2098000	2099000	the position,
2099000	2100000	that is,
2100000	2101000	it is like an island,
2101000	2102000	not with any protein,
2102000	2103000	there is a connection,
2103000	2104000	that this,
2104000	2105000	if this part,
2105000	2106000	we can,
2106000	2107000	directly judge,
2107000	2108000	it is very likely to be Sermal RNA,
2108000	2109000	of course,
2109000	2110000	we will look at its length,
2110000	2111000	Sermal RNA length,
2111000	2112000	usually,
2112000	2114000	within 300 to 500 nucleotides,
2114000	2115000	so,
2115000	2116000	if it does not have any,
2116000	2117000	with protein,
2117000	2118000	any contact,
2118000	2119000	high,
2119000	2120000	high expression,
2120000	2121000	and then there is the starting value,
2121000	2122000	the length,
2122000	2123000	again,
2123000	2124000	less than 300 to 500,
2124000	2125000	then we can directly judge,
2125000	2126000	it is very likely to be,
2126000	2127000	Sermal RNA,
2127000	2128000	non-coding RNA,
2128000	2129000	if its distance is too long,
2129000	2130000	we will go to see,
2130000	2131000	is there a part of the part,
2131000	2132000	a,
2132000	2133000	a,
2133000	2134000	a point,
2134000	2135000	is that it has this,
2135000	2136000	obvious,
2136000	2137000	large magnitude,
2137000	2138000	expression of the decline,
2138000	2139000	if there is,
2139000	2140000	it is very likely,
2140000	2141000	this paragraph,
2141000	2142000	is that we did not predict,
2142000	2143000	the Terminator,
2143000	2144000	so,
2144000	2145000	here may be,
2145000	2146000	Sermal RNA,
2146000	2147000	or is there,
2147000	2148000	is there a possibility,
2148000	2149000	it is a process inside,
2149000	2150000	that is,
2150000	2151000	process inside,
2151000	2152000	that is,
2152000	2153000	it has enzyme,
2153000	2154000	it will cut the gene,
2154000	2155000	let it,
2155000	2156000	this paragraph,
2156000	2157000	that is,
2157000	2158000	take it to do,
2158000	2159000	do prediction,
2159000	2160000	that is,
2160000	2161000	it will cut this paragraph,
2161000	2162000	and then this paragraph,
2162000	2163000	becomes a functional Sermal RNA,
2163000	2164000	if this situation,
2164000	2165000	we also think,
2165000	2166000	it is possible,
2166000	2167000	that another location,
2167000	2168000	is in UTR-derived,
2168000	2169000	that is,
2169000	2170000	it will,
2170000	2171000	it will be with protein,
2171000	2172000	together,
2172000	2173000	transition,
2173000	2174000	sorry,
2174000	2175000	but it will not transition,
2175000	2176000	into the protein area,
2176000	2177000	that is,
2177000	2178000	at the end of the part,
2178000	2179000	if it has TSS,
2179000	2180000	that is,
2180000	2181000	already to the end,
2181000	2182000	obviously to the end,
2182000	2183000	but it has a start value,
2183000	2184000	or it has a process inside,
2184000	2185000	will cut it,
2185000	2186000	that it is very likely,
2186000	2187000	in fact,
2187000	2188000	it is Sermal RNA,
2188000	2189000	at the end,
2189000	2190000	that is,
2190000	2191000	if it has a start value,
2191000	2192000	that end,
2192000	2193000	in,
2193000	2194000	to reach,
2194000	2195000	protein time,
2195000	2196000	it has a process inside,
2196000	2197000	here,
2197000	2198000	or it has an expression,
2198000	2199000	a significant decline,
2199000	2200000	we also think,
2200000	2201000	it may be Sermal RNA,
2201000	2202000	the other is,
2202000	2203000	Interstitial,
2203000	2204000	that is,
2204000	2205000	it is two proteins,
2205000	2206000	transition,
2206000	2207000	as mentioned earlier,
2207000	2208000	it is a transition together,
2208000	2209000	two proteins,
2209000	2210000	and then in the middle,
2210000	2211000	this block,
2211000	2214000	with 5'-LUT is very similar,
2214000	2215000	if it has a start value,
2215000	2217000	because there is a process inside associate,
2217000	2218000	or its end,
2218000	2220000	it has a significant decline,
2220000	2223000	that it may also be Sermal RNA,
2223000	2224000	good,
2224000	2225000	let's take a look,
2225000	2226000	this,
2226000	2227000	our algorithm,
2227000	2228000	will not work,
2228000	2229000	so we apply it,
2229000	2230000	in several,
2230000	2231000	uh,
2231000	2232000	uh,
2232000	2233000	strands,
2233000	2234000	several proteins,
2234000	2235000	first of all,
2235000	2236000	this is a,
2236000	2237000	Intergenic Sermal RNA,
2237000	2238000	you can pay attention to see,
2238000	2239000	in this,
2239000	2240000	uh,
2240000	2241000	uh,
2241000	2243000	transcript is very obvious,
2243000	2244000	high expression,
2244000	2245000	then there is TSS,
2245000	2246000	that is,
2246000	2247000	start value here,
2247000	2250000	then we go to take this sequence,
2250000	2251000	we go to the data base to compare,
2251000	2253000	it is a known Sermal RNA,
2253000	2255000	that we can not only find the known,
2255000	2257000	we can find some unknown,
2257000	2258000	some novel,
2258000	2259000	for example,
2259000	2260000	here,
2260000	2261000	it is the same expression,
2261000	2262000	that is,
2262000	2263000	there is TSS here,
2263000	2264000	it has not been reported,
2264000	2265000	it is Sermal RNA,
2265000	2266000	but it is obvious,
2266000	2267000	if it has expression,
2267000	2268000	there must be something there,
2268000	2269000	so it is very likely,
2269000	2270000	it is not found,
2270000	2271000	Sermal RNA,
2271000	2272000	that is,
2272000	2273000	in 5'UTR,
2273000	2274000	you can see,
2274000	2275000	about the front part,
2275000	2276000	it is a transition,
2276000	2277000	here,
2277000	2278000	protein here,
2278000	2279000	that front un-transition block,
2279000	2280000	there is a very extreme,
2280000	2281000	high expression,
2281000	2282000	block,
2282000	2283000	then we go to cut it to see,
2283000	2284000	then here,
2284000	2285000	there is a very fast decline,
2285000	2286000	we go to cut it to see,
2286000	2287000	found that it is,
2287000	2288000	a known Sermal RNA,
2288000	2289000	that is,
2289000	2290000	3'N,
2290000	2291000	has reached the end,
2292000	2294000	there is a very high expression,
2294000	2295000	then we go to see,
2295000	2297000	it is also a known Sermal RNA,
2297000	2298000	that is,
2298000	2299000	inter-CDS,
2299000	2300000	these two CDS,
2300000	2301000	it is a transition,
2301000	2302000	you can see,
2302000	2303000	it is a transition,
2303000	2304000	in the middle part,
2304000	2306000	there is a sudden high expression,
2306000	2307000	there is also a TSS,
2307000	2308000	then we go to see,
2308000	2310000	it is also a known Sermal RNA,
2310000	2311000	that is,
2311000	2312000	antisense,
2312000	2313000	I just did not talk about antisense,
2313000	2314000	basically,
2314000	2315000	it is in a direction,
2315000	2316000	there is protein,
2316000	2317000	for example,
2317000	2318000	it is in this direction,
2318000	2319000	from right to left,
2319000	2320000	this direction of the transition,
2320000	2321000	it is going down,
2321000	2323000	it means it is in this direction,
2323000	2325000	then it is a protein,
2325000	2327000	but in its relative direction,
2327000	2328000	from left to right,
2328000	2331000	it also has a block is expressed,
2331000	2333000	they are overlapping,
2333000	2334000	then we go to see,
2334000	2335000	found that here,
2335000	2336000	in fact,
2336000	2337000	it is also a Sermal RNA,
2337000	2339000	then we call it antisense,
2339000	2340000	Sermal RNA,
2340000	2341000	that is,
2341000	2342000	it is different from the protein in the direction,
2342000	2344000	overlap each other,
2344000	2345000	OK,
2345000	2346000	then,
2346000	2347000	since we have seen these cases,
2347000	2348000	we want to know,
2348000	2350000	what is the accuracy rate?
2350000	2351000	So,
2351000	2354000	we went to compare four different bacteria,
2354000	2358000	they all already have a known Sermal RNA list,
2358000	2360000	then we go to predict,
2360000	2362000	we found that our detection rate,
2362000	2364000	probably up to 80%,
2364000	2365000	according to different species,
2365000	2366000	different percentages,
2366000	2368000	but 80% to 90%,
2368000	2370000	we can detect all of them,
2370000	2373000	known Sermal RNA,
2373000	2374000	that is,
2374000	2375000	there is no problem,
2375000	2376000	that unknown,
2376000	2378000	we will not have a lot of mutations?
2378000	2379000	So,
2379000	2381000	we have a cooperation with NIH,
2381000	2383000	then they use our tool to analyze,
2383000	2384000	Bordetella pertussis,
2384000	2386000	is also a bacteria,
2386000	2388000	then he found 15,
2388000	2389000	they think it is possible,
2389000	2391000	Sermal RNA candidate,
2391000	2392000	some of which,
2392000	2393000	they think it is possible,
2393000	2394000	but,
2394000	2395000	Energetic did not predict,
2395000	2397000	if you see the ID,
2397000	2398000	Energetic ID,
2398000	2399000	we have predicted,
2399000	2400000	that is not,
2400000	2401000	we do not think it,
2401000	2402000	Energetic,
2402000	2403000	do not think it is,
2403000	2404000	that result,
2404000	2405000	that is,
2405000	2407000	there are about 10,
2407000	2409000	is the correct prediction,
2409000	2410000	that is,
2410000	2412000	really is Sermal RNA,
2412000	2414000	or really is not Sermal RNA,
2414000	2415000	so,
2415000	2417000	there is about 70% accuracy,
2417000	2419000	that we simply introduce a case,
2419000	2420000	we think,
2420000	2422000	we all think very interesting case,
2422000	2423000	that this is,
2423000	2425000	two proteins here,
2425000	2427000	in the middle,
2427000	2429000	there is a very high expression of Sermal RNA,
2429000	2431000	we predict it is Sermal RNA,
2431000	2432000	OK,
2432000	2435000	its length is about 67 nucleotides,
2435000	2437000	is 67 nucleotide length,
2437000	2438000	then,
2438000	2439000	we know that this is very interesting,
2439000	2440000	Maxine fat burning,
2440000	2442000	it is known to suppress,
2442000	2445000	the expression of the cause of the disease,
2445000	2446000	so,
2446000	2448000	if we do not add Maxine fat burning,
2448000	2450000	you will find that this Sermal RNA exists,
2450000	2451000	67,
2451000	2452000	there is a very strong signal,
2452000	2453000	that is,
2453000	2454000	this Sermal RNA really exists,
2454000	2456000	it really will function,
2456000	2457000	but,
2457000	2458000	if we add Maxine fat burning,
2458000	2461000	because the cause of the disease was reduced,
2461000	2463000	you will find that the expression of this Sermal RNA is also reduced,
2463000	2464000	it is said that this Sermal RNA,
2464000	2466000	it is related to the disease,
2466000	2467000	OK,
2467000	2468000	then,
2468000	2469000	the study has found that,
2469000	2470000	BVG-AS,
2470000	2471000	it is two,
2471000	2472000	called two-component system,
2472000	2474000	they will interact,
2474000	2475000	then,
2475000	2477000	how to say,
2477000	2480000	will promote the expression of the cause of the disease,
2480000	2481000	when we,
2481000	2483000	if we go to mutate,
2483000	2485000	this BVG-AS,
2485000	2486000	you will find that,
2486000	2488000	no matter if you add Maxine fat burning,
2488000	2489000	this,
2489000	2490000	Sermal RNA,
2490000	2491000	its expression is reduced,
2491000	2492000	that is to say,
2492000	2493000	this Sermal RNA,
2493000	2494000	it will also be,
2494000	2495000	this,
2495000	2496000	BVG-AS,
2496000	2497000	two-component system,
2497000	2498000	control,
2498000	2499000	in addition,
2499000	2500000	there is a thing called,
2500000	2501000	HFQ,
2501000	2502000	it is a global,
2502000	2503000	Sermal RNA binding chaperone,
2503000	2504000	that is,
2504000	2505000	it will be with many,
2505000	2506000	different Sermal RNA,
2506000	2507000	do the interaction,
2507000	2508000	that,
2508000	2510000	the purpose is to help these Sermal RNA,
2510000	2511000	to,
2511000	2512000	find,
2512000	2513000	to,
2513000	2514000	its target,
2514000	2515000	above,
2515000	2516000	so,
2516000	2517000	when this HFQ,
2517000	2518000	when this HFQ,
2518000	2519000	is mutated,
2519000	2520000	you will find,
2520000	2521000	Sermal RNA,
2521000	2522000	reduced more,
2522000	2523000	so,
2523000	2524000	here,
2524000	2525000	it is very simple,
2525000	2526000	to launch a,
2526000	2527000	hypothesis,
2527000	2528000	that is,
2528000	2529000	this Sermal RNA,
2529000	2530000	it is related to the cause of the disease,
2530000	2532000	it will do the interaction with HFQ,
2532000	2533000	to find its target,
2533000	2534000	to,
2534000	2535000	target gene,
2535000	2536000	that,
2536000	2537000	it will also be,
2537000	2538000	BVG-AS,
2538000	2539000	control,
2539000	2540000	so,
2540000	2541000	from here,
2541000	2542000	we can see that,
2542000	2543000	in fact,
2543000	2544000	analgesic,
2544000	2545000	we have predicted,
2545000	2546000	novel Sermal RNA,
2546000	2547000	with a certain accuracy rate,
2547000	2548000	good,
2548000	2549000	in addition to Sermal RNA,
2549000	2550000	we can also,
2550000	2551000	as we just said,
2551000	2552000	predict 20,
2552000	2553000	20 different genomic features,
2553000	2554000	so,
2554000	2555000	we will compare,
2555000	2556000	each different,
2556000	2557000	feature,
2557000	2558000	their database,
2558000	2559000	that,
2559000	2560000	most of the database,
2560000	2561000	it has Ecoline,
2561000	2562000	large-sensitivity data,
2562000	2563000	so,
2563000	2564000	we use large-sensitivity to do,
2564000	2565000	that,
2565000	2566000	we have differential RNA sequencing,
2566000	2567000	or,
2567000	2568000	we only use traditional RNA-seq,
2568000	2569000	that,
2569000	2570000	most of the accuracy rate,
2570000	2571000	can reach about 80%,
2571000	2572000	the prediction accuracy rate,
2572000	2573000	but,
2573000	2574000	there are two,
2574000	2575000	very special,
2575000	2576000	one is called TSS,
2576000	2577000	which is the starting value,
2577000	2578000	one is Promoter,
2578000	2579000	one is only 6%,
2579000	2580000	one is 39%,
2580000	2581000	but, of course,
2581000	2582000	we can also understand,
2582000	2583000	because Promoter and TSS,
2583000	2584000	are related,
2584000	2585000	Promoter is usually,
2585000	2586000	on the top of TSS,
2586000	2587000	35 to 50,
2587000	2589000	nucleotide length,
2589000	2590000	so,
2590000	2591000	TSS is not good,
2591000	2592000	Promoter,
2592000	2593000	of course,
2593000	2594000	will not be good,
2594000	2595000	so,
2595000	2596000	why not,
2596000	2597000	we will see,
2597000	2598000	that,
2598000	2599000	this is,
2599000	2600000	in Public Database,
2600000	2601000	RegulonDB,
2601000	2602000	three,
2602000	2603000	RNA sequencing data,
2603000	2604000	they,
2604000	2605000	then,
2605000	2606000	you will find,
2606000	2607000	they have,
2607000	2608000	very large,
2608000	2609000	sequence,
2609000	2610000	only 43,
2610000	2611000	starting value,
2611000	2612000	they are,
2612000	2613000	can be found,
2613000	2614000	that,
2614000	2615000	there are many,
2615000	2616000	most of them,
2616000	2617000	they are self-evident,
2617000	2618000	there is no overlap,
2618000	2619000	then,
2619000	2620000	we suspect,
2620000	2621000	this data,
2621000	2622000	there should be a problem,
2622000	2623000	because,
2623000	2624000	they are all Ecoline,
2624000	2625000	how can the difference be so big,
2625000	2626000	so,
2626000	2627000	we want to say,
2627000	2628000	then,
2628000	2629000	we put,
2629000	2630000	all,
2630000	2631000	these three,
2631000	2632000	Database,
2632000	2633000	plus,
2633000	2634000	these data,
2634000	2635000	these TSS data,
2635000	2636000	we all go forward,
2636000	2637000	to find Promoter,
2637000	2638000	see if we can find Promoter,
2638000	2639000	the result,
2639000	2640000	is like this,
2640000	2641000	these three,
2641000	2642000	Database,
2642000	2643000	Dataset,
2643000	2644000	they have no way,
2644000	2645000	to find,
2645000	2646000	the existence of Promoter,
2646000	2647000	but,
2647000	2648000	in Energetic,
2648000	2649000	80% of TSS,
2649000	2650000	can find,
2650000	2651000	with this Promoter,
2651000	2652000	Association,
2652000	2653000	so,
2653000	2654000	we can know,
2654000	2655000	these three,
2655000	2656000	Public,
2656000	2657000	these three,
2657000	2658000	Public Dataset,
2658000	2659000	actually,
2659000	2660000	there is a problem,
2660000	2661000	then,
2661000	2662000	Energetic,
2662000	2663000	it is actually,
2663000	2664000	accuracy,
2664000	2665000	in providing,
2665000	2666000	Annotation,
2666000	2667000	it is a,
2667000	2668000	high-quality,
2668000	2669000	Annotation,
2669000	2670000	OK,
2670000	2671000	then,
2671000	2672000	I want,
2672000	2674000	to introduce here,
2674000	2675000	then,
2675000	2676000	other Features,
2676000	2677000	if you are interested,
2677000	2678000	we can discuss,
2678000	2679000	we can discuss,
2679000	2680000	no problem,
2680000	2681000	then,
2681000	2682000	finally,
2682000	2683000	I want to,
2683000	2684000	give you a little,
2684000	2685000	report,
2685000	2686000	give you a little,
2686000	2687000	advertising,
2687000	2688000	welcome everyone to use,
2688000	2689000	basically,
2689000	2690000	it is like this,
2690000	2691000	this,
2691000	2692000	our,
2692000	2693000	Energetic,
2693000	2694000	has been,
2694000	2695000	integrated,
2695000	2696000	to NIH,
2696000	2697000	biological information,
2697000	2698000	list,
2698000	2699000	inside,
2699000	2700000	so,
2700000	2701000	NIH,
2701000	2702000	can also be very free,
2702000	2703000	they are also very,
2703000	2704000	often use our tool,
2704000	2705000	then,
2705000	2706000	the second is,
2706000	2707000	LabOne,
2707000	2708000	it is a,
2708000	2709000	organization,
2709000	2710000	it will collect,
2710000	2711000	various,
2711000	2712000	different,
2712000	2713000	biological information,
2713000	2714000	software,
2714000	2715000	they are,
2715000	2716000	when they collect,
2716000	2717000	software,
2717000	2718000	they will do,
2718000	2719000	voting,
2719000	2720000	will let this,
2720000	2721000	they can vote,
2721000	2722000	they feel better,
2722000	2723000	then,
2723000	2724000	we were,
2724000	2725000	recorded that week,
2725000	2726000	voting,
2726000	2727000	we are,
2727000	2728000	top three,
2728000	2729000	position,
2729000	2730000	then,
2730000	2731000	the other Energetic,
2731000	2732000	was also reported,
2732000	2733000	by RNA-seq blog,
2733000	2734000	then,
2734000	2735000	when we have preprinted,
2735000	2736000	we will be reported,
2736000	2737000	to RNA-seq blog,
2737000	2738000	that blog,
2738000	2739000	is also a lot of people,
2739000	2740000	in addition,
2740000	2741000	we are now,
2741000	2742000	this Energetic,
2742000	2743000	has been applied to,
2743000	2744000	very,
2744000	2745000	very,
2745000	2746000	different,
2746000	2747000	very,
2747000	2748000	different,
2748000	2749000	bacteria,
2749000	2750000	so,
2750000	2751000	a lot of,
2751000	2752000	published,
2752000	2753000	paper,
2753000	2754000	then,
2754000	2755000	some,
2755000	2756000	tools,
2756000	2757000	also started to use,
2757000	2758000	our tools,
2758000	2759000	as a,
2759000	2760000	standard,
2760000	2761000	because we are,
2761000	2762000	the first tool,
2762000	2763000	to use RNA-seq,
2763000	2764000	to do,
2764000	2765000	non-coding RNA,
2765000	2766000	prediction,
2766000	2767000	so,
2767000	2768000	they also started,
2768000	2769000	to integrate,
2769000	2770000	these Energetic,
2770000	2771000	tools,
2771000	2772000	or compare,
2772000	2773000	our tools,
2773000	2774000	then,
2774000	2775000	recently,
2775000	2776000	a lot of,
2776000	2777000	papers,
2777000	2778000	have been published,
2778000	2779000	so,
2779000	2780000	I will,
2780000	2781000	I will also,
2781000	2782000	reply,
2782000	2783000	if I have a bug,
2783000	2784000	welcome to tell me,
2784000	2785000	then I can also,
2785000	2786000	correct,
2786000	2787000	so,
2787000	2788000	this is,
2788000	2789000	our GitHub,
2789000	2790000	basically,
2790000	2791000	Energetic,
2791000	2792000	is stored here,
2792000	2793000	it is an open source,
2793000	2794000	everyone can,
2794000	2795000	use at will,
2795000	2796000	you want to modify,
2796000	2797000	or how,
2797000	2798000	there is no problem,
2798000	2799000	if there is any problem,
2799000	2800000	this issue,
2800000	2801000	you can also open,
2801000	2802000	then I can also,
2802000	2803000	go to see,
2803000	2804000	to upgrade,
2804000	2805000	OK,
2805000	2806000	good,
2806000	2807000	finally,
2807000	2808000	Energetic,
2808000	2809000	is the first,
2809000	2810000	modular,
2810000	2811000	and systematic,
2811000	2812000	RNA-seq-based tool,
2812000	2813000	to do,
2813000	2814000	genome annotations,
2814000	2815000	mainly for,
2815000	2816000	bacteria and archaea,
2816000	2817000	then we compare,
2817000	2818000	a lot of different tools,
2818000	2819000	then we integrate,
2819000	2820000	the best one,
2820000	2821000	then,
2821000	2822000	we also create,
2822000	2823000	then improve,
2823000	2824000	these methods,
2824000	2825000	we not only integrate,
2825000	2826000	we also improve,
2826000	2827000	then we can,
2827000	2828000	systematically,
2828000	2829000	to compare,
2829000	2830000	to detect,
2830000	2831000	many different,
2831000	2832000	genomic features,
2832000	2833000	then we also,
2833000	2834000	optimize,
2834000	2835000	necessary to optimize,
2835000	2836000	these parameters,
2836000	2837000	so,
2837000	2838000	users can freely,
2838000	2839000	to use,
2839000	2840000	to do,
2840000	2841000	you want to do,
2841000	2842000	feature detection,
2842000	2843000	then we provide,
2843000	2844000	statistics,
2844000	2845000	and visualization,
2845000	2846000	for your reference,
2846000	2847000	OK,
2847000	2848000	finally,
2848000	2849000	is to give you a,
2849000	2850000	high-quality annotations,
2850000	2851000	then,
2851000	2852000	in the future,
2852000	2853000	we hope to continue,
2853000	2854000	is,
2854000	2855000	to use deep learning,
2855000	2856000	to improve,
2856000	2857000	our predictions,
2857000	2858000	deep learning,
2858000	2859000	it is a,
2859000	2860000	up-to-date,
2860000	2861000	machine learning method,
2861000	2862000	then the other is,
2862000	2863000	we also hope,
2863000	2864000	to integrate more,
2864000	2865000	RNA-seq protocol data,
2865000	2866000	to help us,
2866000	2867000	improve,
2867000	2868000	our prediction accuracy,
2868000	2869000	we also hope,
2869000	2870000	to extend,
2870000	2871000	our function,
2871000	2872000	to,

2879000	2880000	my,
2880000	2881000	this is my,
2881000	2882000	subject,
2882000	2883000	although,
2883000	2884000	I have left,
2884000	2885000	for a while,
2885000	2886000	but,
2886000	2887000	this,
2887000	2888000	we have been updating,
2888000	2889000	that,
2889000	2890000	this is my,
2890000	2891000	boss,
2891000	2892000	then his,
2892000	2893000	people below,
2893000	2894000	help me,
2894000	2895000	experiment data,
2895000	2896000	that,
2896000	2897000	this is our,
2897000	2898000	bioinformatics team,
2898000	2899000	that,
2899000	2900000	NIH,
2900000	2901000	help us,
2901000	2902000	experiment,
2902000	2903000	cooperation subject,
2903000	2904000	that,
2904000	2905000	this is my boss now,
2905000	2906000	although,
2906000	2907000	I have jumped to,
2907000	2908000	proteomics,
2908000	2909000	and,
2909000	2910000	multiomics,
2910000	2911000	and,
2911000	2912000	single cell,
2912000	2913000	less touch,
2913000	2914000	RNA-seq,
2914000	2915000	this,
2915000	2916000	bacteria,
2916000	2917000	RNA-seq part,
2917000	2918000	but,
2918000	2919000	he still,
2919000	2920000	give us a lot of freedom,
2920000	2921000	can go,
2921000	2922000	maintain,
2922000	2923000	my tool,
2923000	2924000	probably,
2924000	2925000	that,
2925000	2926000	if there are any questions,
2926000	2927000	I am very,
2927000	2928000	welcome,

2932000	2933000	OK,
2933000	2934000	thank you,
2934000	2935000	Songpan,
2935000	2936000	help us do such a wonderful speech,
2936000	2937000	OK,
2937000	2938000	now,
2938000	2939000	audience,
2939000	2940000	is there anyone who has any questions,
2940000	2941000	you can turn on your microphone,
2941000	2942000	then,
2942000	2943000	ask questions,
2947000	2948000	OK,
2948000	2949000	if not,
2949000	2950000	I will,
2950000	2951000	have,
2951000	2952000	OK,
2952000	2953000	hello,
2953000	2954000	I am,
2954000	2955000	British,
2955000	2956000	Bristol University,
2956000	2957000	first time,
2957000	2958000	to attend,
2958000	2959000	this conference,
2959000	2960000	thank you,
2960000	2961000	have you heard,
2961000	2962000	yes,
2962000	2963000	yes,
2963000	2964000	yes,
2964000	2965000	thank you,
2965000	2966000	one question,
2966000	2967000	you mentioned,
2967000	2968000	that,
2968000	2969000	there is a,
2969000	2970000	TSS optimization,
2970000	2971000	that is,
2971000	2972000	parameter adjustment,
2972000	2973000	that,
2973000	2974000	myself,
2974000	2975000	recently,
2975000	2976000	was taught by the boss,
2976000	2977000	to analyze,
2977000	2978000	proteomics,
2978000	2979000	that adjustment,
2979000	2980000	refers to,
2980000	2981000	comparing,
2981000	2982000	the RNA sequencing,
2982000	2983000	with
2983000	2984000	the Z-score,
2984000	2985000	how do you,
2985000	2986000	how do you say,
2986000	2987000	that part is,
2987000	2988000	relatively,
2988000	2989000	not so,
2989000	2990000	complicated,
2990000	2991000	because,
2991000	2992000	we are,
2992000	2993000	our,
2993000	2994000	we are,
2994000	2995000	the WebLab,
2995000	2996000	members,
2996000	2997000	they are,
2997000	2998000	seriously,
2998000	2999000	to really
2999000	3000000	use the meat of the body,
3000000	3001000	to compare,
3001000	3002000	this,
3002000	3003000	RNA sequencing of data,
3003000	3004000	so they are very certain,
3004000	3005000	to find out the meat,
3005000	3006000	after the comparison,
3006000	3007000	set,
3007000	3008000	so these sets,
3008000	3009000	is our Golden Standard,
3009000	3010000	so I'm going to compare,
3010000	3011000	this set,
3011000	3012000	and then calculate,
3012000	3013000	sensitivity,
3013000	3014000	and specificity,
3014000	3015000	right,
3015000	3016000	so,
3016000	3017000	I did not use,
3017000	3018000	P-value,
3018000	3019000	this thing,
3019000	3020000	right,
3020000	3021000	but,
3021000	3022000	if you are doing,
3022000	3023000	proteomics,
3023000	3024000	then,
3024000	3025000	it is possible,
3025000	3026000	you need to compare,
3026000	3027000	P-value,
3027000	3028000	but,
3028000	3029000	how to do this in detail,
3029000	3030000	we may,
3030000	3031000	need to know,
3031000	3032000	ah,
3032000	3034000	the purpose of your research,
3034000	3035000	and,
3035000	3036000	optimization,
3036000	3037000	or,
3037000	3038000	you can do this,
3038000	3039000	so,
3039000	3040000	you need to know,
3040000	3041000	how to do this,
3041000	3042000	to determine,
3042000	3043000	this,
3043000	3044000	right,
3044000	3045000	thank you.
3045000	3046000	Okay,
3046000	3047000	so I have a question,
3047000	3048000	which is,
3048000	3049000	thank you for providing,
3049000	3050000	this,
3050000	3051000	this,
3051000	3052000	this,
3052000	3053000	this,
3053000	3054000	this,
3054000	3055000	this,
3055000	3056000	this,
3056000	3057000	this,
3057000	3058000	this,
3058000	3059000	this,
3059000	3060000	this,
3060000	3061000	this,
3061000	3062000	this,
3062000	3063000	this,
3063000	3064000	this,
3064000	3065000	this,
3065000	3066000	this,
3066000	3067000	this,
3067000	3068000	this,
3068000	3069000	this,
3069000	3070000	this,
3070000	3071000	this,
3071000	3072000	this,
3072000	3073000	this,
3073000	3074000	this,
3074000	3075000	this,
3075000	3076000	this,
3076000	3077000	this,
3077000	3078000	this,
3078000	3079000	this,
3079000	3080000	this,
3080000	3081000	this,
3081000	3082000	this,
3082000	3083000	and this.
3083000	3084000	So,
3084000	3085000	the question I want to ask you is,
3085000	3086000	about your research,
3087000	3088000	I did,
3088000	3091000	some solar star system complexes,
3091000	3094000	what are the general characteristics of this solar star system,
3094000	3095000	and how do you determine
3095000	3096000	the individual characteristics,
3096000	3097000	for example,
3097000	3098000	we have different,
3098000	3099000	uh,
3099000	3100000	patients,
3100000	3101000	their,
3101000	3102000	for example,
3102000	3103000	we want to know,
3103000	3104000	we want to know,
3104000	3106000	does it change the pathology of the pathology,
3107000	3108000	that this thing,
3108000	3109000	for,
3109000	3111000	for annotation,
3111000	3113000	the requirements are relatively low,
3114000	3115000	so they will usually,
3115000	3117000	usually go to see the pathology of the change,
3117000	3119000	to do statistics analysis,
3119000	3120000	right,
3120000	3121000	but he,
3121000	3122000	this method,
3122000	3125000	he can study some of these pathologies,
3125000	3126000	that is,
3126000	3127000	the performance of RNN,
3127000	3128000	uh,
3128000	3129000	polygons,
3129000	3130000	or,
3130000	3132000	does he have any RNA performance?
3132000	3133000	Can you use this tool?
3134000	3135000	There may be no way,
3135000	3137000	because if you want to do,
3137000	3138000	look at the performance of RNA,
3138000	3139000	in fact,
3139000	3140000	we do,
3140000	3141000	simply do mapping,
3141000	3142000	we can get this,
3142000	3143000	uh,
3143000	3144000	that is,
3144000	3145000	we generally talk about this,
3145000	3146000	we just said,
3146000	3147000	at the beginning of this histogram part,
3148000	3149000	that is,
3149000	3150000	you can get,
3152000	3153000	you can get this thing,
3154000	3155000	that,
3155000	3156000	usually we do,
3156000	3157000	will not do,
3157000	3158000	there is a need to see,
3158000	3159000	non-coding RNA,
3159000	3160000	UTRR,
3160000	3161000	and so on,
3161000	3162000	less,
3162000	3163000	but of course,
3163000	3164000	if they,
3164000	3165000	someone wants to use,
3165000	3166000	there is no problem,
3166000	3167000	it can also be done,
3167000	3168000	it can also be analyzed,
3168000	3169000	absolutely no problem,
3169000	3170000	can be used,
3170000	3171000	just that I am,
3171000	3172000	I am just less,
3172000	3173000	almost did not see anyone,
3173000	3174000	will do,
3174000	3175000	to do,
3175000	3176000	want to go to see,
3176000	3177000	non-coding RNA,
3177000	3178000	or go to see,
3178000	3179000	this UTRR,
3179000	3180000	or look at the binding type,
3180000	3181000	and so on,
3181000	3182000	less,
3182000	3183000	usually go,
3183000	3184000	directly to see,
3184000	3185000	UTRR,
3185000	3186000	will be more,
3186000	3187000	understand,
3187000	3188000	good,
3188000	3189000	thank you,
3193000	3194000	that,
3194000	3195000	there are people,
3195000	3196000	any questions?
3202000	3203000	OK,
3203000	3204000	if not,
3204000	3205000	then we thank,
3205000	3206000	Songwan today,
3206000	3207000	to give us this speech,
3207000	3208000	that we look forward to next time,
3208000	3209000	if you still have a chance,
3209000	3210000	can come again,
3210000	3211000	Taiwan,
3211000	3213000	update the latest research,
3213000	3214000	thank you,
3214000	3215000	thank you,
3215000	3216000	thank you,
