WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The recording has started.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Good evening, everyone.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Sorry, let me talk first.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Welcome everyone to the Taira Talk on March 28th.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
We are honored to invite Alan Xu to give a speech for us today.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Alan Xu was a medical student at Chenggong University when he was in college.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
He majored in dengue and other blood-related diseases.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
He is now a Ph.D. student at Purdue University.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Today's topic is

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
Identifying Potential Therapeutics for Modulating Neutrophil Inflammation.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Before the speech, let's give Alan a round of applause.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Remember to turn on your microphones when you applaud.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Please turn on your microphones.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Let's give Alan some time.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Thank you.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Today, I would like to share something different with everyone.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
As Jason mentioned,

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
our research focuses on how to use new methods to get immune cells to control our immune system

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
in order to reach a low level of inflammation,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
but at the same time, to fight against diseases.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
First, I will divide my talk into a brief background introduction.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Then, I will talk about the so-called gene selection.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Finally, I will share with you what we found.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
First, I would like to introduce Neutrophil.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
Neutrophil is commonly known as neutrophil.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
You may have seen it on Facebook or YouTube.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
In 1953, David Rodgers photographed a neutrophil running after bacteria.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Next to it are red blood cells.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
This is the most common neutrophil in our blood.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
40% to 60% of the white blood cells in our blood are neutrophil.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Neutrophil is the fastest-moving cell in our body.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
It can be seen in real time.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Neutrophil can be followed by bacteria.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Neutrophil is the first cell to reach the infection site.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Neutrophil is no longer divided or separated.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
Neutrophil often has these lobes.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
How does Neutrophil reach the infection site?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Neutrophil circulates in the bloodstream.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
There are some adhesive receptors on the outside of our blood vessels.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Neutrophil will roll on the outside of the blood vessels and stick to the adhesive receptors.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
Finally, the adhesive receptors are attached to the adhesive receptors.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
The adhesive receptors are extrapolated or transmigrated.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
The adhesive receptors enter the stem cell.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
After entering the stem cell, we will feel the so-called red hot pain.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
These are the adhesive cells.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
When Neutrophil reaches the infection site, it will perform many functions.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
It will release a lot of cytokines.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
These cytokines can let more Neutrophil in.

03:47.000 --> 03:59.000
These cytokines can also let other immune cells, such as macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, etc.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
However, cytokines are very important for the transmission of information and speech.

04:06.000 --> 04:17.000
However, too much cytokines can cause hemorrhage and shock.

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
Neutrophil can also perform phagocytosis.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Neutrophil can directly swallow microorganisms.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
After swallowing, Neutrophil will release some free radicals, ROS, to break them down.

04:35.000 --> 04:44.000
ROS can also be placed outside the cell to cause the whole organ to develop and attract more immune cells and a reaction to develop.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
However, too many free radicals will cause oxidation.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
So, we often say that we should avoid drinking tea, reduce free radicals, and reduce aging.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
This is because these free radicals will cause organ damage, which is not good for too many people.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
Neutrophil's most famous function is called Net Formation, or Neutrophil Accelerator Trap.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
When Neutrophil finds that its own immune response is too strong or too many bacteria are around it, it can't do anything by itself.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
When we watch movies, we see this hero or male supporting role.

05:15.000 --> 05:24.000
When Neutrophil finds that there are too many enemies, it will usually hold a hand grenade and directly return to these bacteria, or return to the enemy.

05:24.000 --> 05:33.000
At this time, Neutrophil will release its DNA, which is the DNA in this box, outside the cell to form a sticky web-like thing called Net.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
This name is very similar.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
It can trap these bacteria or viruses there.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
There are also some enzymes on this Net that can help break them down.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
This Net itself can also be used as a function to attract immune cells.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
However, too many of these Nets will actually cause body immunity.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
Because our body's immune system does not recognize DNA as a substance by training, so sometimes it will cause body immunity.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
Generally, in the ideal case, Neutrophil does not have excessive inflammation.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
When Neutrophil plays its role, Neutrophil will have apoptosis and die.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
These impurities will be devoured by macrophages, which is another type of cell.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Then the inflammation will slow down.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
Otherwise, Neutrophil can climb back to its blood vessels and continue to circulate.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
I hope that through these functions, we can make it easier for everyone to understand.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
The first cell to reach the inflammation site, how does it do it?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
How does it decide?

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Often it will decide the outcome of our inflammation.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Will it kill?

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
Will it successfully eliminate our foreign bacteria or viruses?

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
So we have to find a way to study if there is a new way to control the reaction of inflammation.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Why do we need to control the reaction of inflammation?

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
As I said four times, it is a balance.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
It is like the cover of a science magazine.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
We need it, but too much is not good.

07:22.000 --> 07:33.000
Because of the recent COVID-19 epidemic, I just took this example to tell you why people die from COVID-19.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
This is a lung cancer of our lungs, aviola.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Usually this aviola has air.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
At this time, the SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, will infect the epidermal cells of our aviola.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
The epidermal cells will die.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
The cells will also send out some life-saving signals.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
The neutrophils will run from the aviola to the lung tissue.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
At the same time, the inflammation of the aviola will also cause a rise in blood vessels.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Then the aviola will have a hemorrhage.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
So a lot of immune cells will eliminate bacteria and kill viruses here.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
At the same time, the aviola will have a hemorrhage.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
The inflammation of the aviola will cause a positive feedback.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
This will cause a lot of bystander effects.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
What is a bystander effect?

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
In addition to killing viruses, it kills the virus-infected cells.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
So the tissue of our lungs will be injured.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Injured, there will be a stronger inflammation.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Then there will be more immune cells.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
So it will slowly make our lungs water.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
At the same time, we can't have enough oxygen.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
When there is not enough oxygen, there will be shortness of breath.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's breathing difficulty.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
In the end, lack of oxygen will also cause our organs to lose oxygen.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
If you don't get oxygen, you will die from organ failure.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
People who die from organ failure will die.

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
So basically 90% of people who die from COVID-19 are ARDS.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
ARDS is an over-infection-induced disease.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
But we need it to eliminate the infection of our virus.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
So how to balance this is very important.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
In our lab, the model we use is an aviola model.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Let me introduce this aviola to you first.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
If you are not familiar with it,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
What you see in this video is a three-day aviola.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Its neutral field is marked with GFP, a fluorescent protein.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
It is found that its neutral field is divided into two groups.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
One is in CHT, which is equivalent to our bone marrow.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
So it doesn't move much.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
The other is in the head.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
It will perform some random migration.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It will move randomly.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
Why is aviola a good reason to study neutral field?

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
First, because the whole animal is transparent.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
So it's easy to shoot.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
So you can see if you make some genetic or pharmacological changes.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
You can see the behavior of these cells.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
You can see it in real time.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Second, because this aviola lives in the water.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It is a organ.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Because our organs, whether lungs or stomach, are basically soaked in our mucosa.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It is mucosal immunity.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Because it also lives in the water.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
So its outer skin is equivalent to the inner skin of our lungs.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
So it is also a good reason to study immune cells.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Some important reasons are that its immune system,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Especially the adenovirus immune system.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Neutral field is a member of the adenovirus immune system.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
It is very similar to mammals, such as mice or humans.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
So its shape, or its evolution,

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
And some of its functions are actually very similar to our neutral field.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Finally, a more practical reason is that

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Because this fish is very small.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Like this whole fish is only about three centimeters.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
It's 0.3 centimeters.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
So it's very small.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
You can raise a lot of fish at the same time.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
There is not much space to stand.

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
And a pair of male and female fish can give birth to more than 100 small fish.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So it's good to do some medical research.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
This is just a brief introduction to everyone.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
This zebrafish is a neutral field.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
This is a zebrafish, a neutral field,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
H.E. stain is the color of the blood.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
This is a mouse.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
This is our human.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
So it's actually about the same size.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
There is also this so-called cell box.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
This is a form of compartmentalization.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
This is just a few videos to tell you about the function of this zebrafish's neutral field.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
So this red one is the big intestine.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
It's in the zebrafish.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
This green one is the zebrafish's neutral field.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
So he just saw that the green one would come and swallow the red one.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
That's what we just talked about.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
This is a free machine assay.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
So this MPO myoperoxidase is a free machine.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It is marked as green.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
And then we have this zebrafish's neutral field marked as red.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
So you see that this red and green are intertwined like this.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
In fact, it shows that the zebrafish's neutral field is going to release the free machine.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
The last example is to talk about this neptosis.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
So we just said that we can release the net value of this neutral field.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
So this DAPI is a cell box.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
This cell box has DNA.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
DNA is scattered out of the package.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
So at the same time, you can also see the effects on it.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
MPO elastase.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
So it means that this zebrafish's neutral field is actually quite similar to the functions of humans.

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
So it's just to introduce to you that it can be used to study a good model or model of neutral field biology.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Let me give you a little bit of a change of flavor.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Let me introduce another thing that we are interested in.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It's called microRNA.

13:26.000 --> 13:36.000
MicroRNA is a very short 20 to 22-digit nucleotide.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
It's DNA.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
It can exist from DNA.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It exists in exon and intron.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
It can exist anywhere in our gene.

13:45.000 --> 13:54.000
When it is transferred by our polymerase transcription to RNA, it will have this hairpin structure.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
From this hairpin structure, it will be processed and transported to the outside of our cell box.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
After it is transported to the outside of the cell box, it will be processed again.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
Then it becomes a single 20 to 22-digit RNA complex.

14:12.000 --> 14:22.000
It will identify the target mRNA, which is our messenger RNA, with its other machinery, which is called Ritz complex.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
This messenger RNA is usually used to make protein.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
To suppress it.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Either the whole mRNA will be broken down.

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
Otherwise, it will stop its transfer and prevent it from becoming protein.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
So these microRNAs are like a small key.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Instead of controlling whether this gene is expressed or not.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It says it doesn't matter if you express it.

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
But I can use this microRNA to suppress and adjust the amount of protein it expresses.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Adjust it on the level of RNA.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
Because this microRNA adjustment method is often not a one-off.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Because the expression of your gene is a one-off.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Either it's open or it's closed.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Of course, you can adjust how much it is.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But this is still a more absolute.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
This microRNA suppression phenomenon can often be adjusted.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
For example, 100 mRNAs can only inhibit or suppress half.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
So it becomes a fine tuning.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Because we just said that we have to adjust the expression.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
We can't turn off the whole expression.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Otherwise, people will die.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
So we have to adjust it.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
This microRNA actually has another feature.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Because it's a 22-nucleotide.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
A single microRNA can become a target for many mRNAs.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
In other words, a single key can open many locks.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Or match many transcripts.

15:55.000 --> 16:04.000
In evolution, these microRNAs will often target a pathway.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
There are many related genes on a pathway.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
It means that I can inhibit you walking today.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It can also inhibit you from eating.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It can also inhibit you from sleeping.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
All of these functions can be done by a single microRNA.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
To make a person feel uncomfortable.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
This microRNA is evolutionary conserved.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
It is found in small insects and fruits.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
It is found in all biological phenomena.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
From cancer to plant growth to cell division.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
There are probably microRNAs involved.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Because they have this feature.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
It has been reported as the next generation of medicine.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
We are also trying to identify some microRNAs.

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
To adjust or balance the development of neutrophils.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
Sorry, I have a question.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Can I go back to the last page?

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
This may be a very basic question.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
But mRNA is messenger RNA.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Is it converted to protein outside the cell?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Yes.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
I thought RNA is inside the cell.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Let me explain.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
Our DNA is in the nucleus.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
It will be converted into the nucleus.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
All RNAs are converted into the nucleus.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Some of them will be on the nucleus.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Ribosome will be made into protein.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Some of them will be transported to the nucleus.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
There are many ribosomes there.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Most of them are in the ER.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
The so-called intracellular network.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
It is actually inside another cell.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Can mRNA be transmitted between cells?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
No, between the nucleus and the nucleus.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Our nucleus has two layers.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I see.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I understand.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Sorry.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
I have a question.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
About the next generation of medicine.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
How can we avoid the off-target of microRNA?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
That's a great question.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
I will talk about the next generation of medicine.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
There are two strategies.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
One is to treat microRNA as our friend.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
For example, microRNA34 can be used to suppress cell proliferation.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
MicroRNA29 can be used to treat lung cancer.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
That's right.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
There are two levels of off-target.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
One is the off-target of human organs.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
MicroRNA can be stored in liposomes or carriers.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
It can be used to treat liver cancer.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Liver cancer is easy to treat.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
Liver and kidneys are the organs of human organs.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
There are many special markers in the lungs.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
MicroRNA can be linked to these markers.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
It will be enriched in the lungs.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
MicroRNA can be stored in other organs.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
However, the amount of microRNA will be less than the target.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
The question you asked is very good.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
MicroRNA therapy in the blood is difficult to do.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Because the blood cells are too complicated.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
We can't overcome this.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
In other aspects, such as mRNA122.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
You can inhibit microRNA122.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
You can avoid the infection of HCV.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
It's the same as liver cancer.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Inhibition 155.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Inflammation.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Inflammation of the whole body.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Inflammation of the whole body.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Another level of microRNA off-targeting is

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
whether the hairpin recognizes what you want to recognize.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
This can only be confirmed by experiment.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
Because each cell expresses a different gene profile.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
That's why we have different cells.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Because our dye cells are all the same.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
We can only verify and exclude the different gene profiles.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Did I answer your question?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Yes, thank you.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
You made it very clear.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Thank you.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
This is the part of microRNA therapy.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
We can inhibit it.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
How do we inhibit it?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
It's easy.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
If we go back here, we can see that

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
the microRNA itself comes from a hairpin.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's a hairpin.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
We can give it a complementary strand.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
We can absorb it like a sponge.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Then it won't be able to work.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
This is a way to inhibit it.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
What we are more interested in is

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
directly using this microRNA to off-target.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Before I start, let me summarize for everyone.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
We are going to talk about this research today.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
Basically, we are going to identify which microRNA

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
and its downstream mRNA

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
can be used for translational inhibition.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
That is to inhibit it or

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
to separate the messenger RNA.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
To inhibit Neutrophil migration.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Why do we want to choose Neutrophil migration

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
as our readout?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
First, because

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
we just introduced that

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Neutrophil has too many functions.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
It has a free machine, a package, and a net.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
So it's too difficult for you to look at it first.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Why don't we

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
flatten the curve?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
It's the same thing.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
But on a more human level.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
We don't want Neutrophil to enter

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
as soon as possible.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
We want it to enter slowly.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
So it's easier for your body to adjust.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Your hair is easier to adjust.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
This is our strategy.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
So we hope that

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
at the Neutrophil recruitment level,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
we can flatten the curve

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
to prevent over-inflammation.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Whether it's asthma,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
joint inflammation,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
or multiple sclerosis.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Including ARDS,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
which is also an over-inflammation.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
But at the same time,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
we still have to keep a function.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Because now on the market,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
all the treatments for this immune disease

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
are like our endocrine

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
or some corticosteroids.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Or some specific immune suppressors.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
But the problem is that

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
these things will bring

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
the defect of your immune system.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Then you may have a very serious cold.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
So what we are going to answer today is

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
which microRNA can do this.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Can prevent Neutrophil migration

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
from being so much.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
But at the same time,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
it can keep our immune system.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
What are its MRNAs?

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Maybe we can go and study

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
which of its lower genes

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
can control Neutrophil.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
So this is the second part.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
We are going to start discussing this screen.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Does anyone have any questions here?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
So the method we use

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
is an overexpression screen.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So we are going to sequence

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
all the two types of cells.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Neutrophil and epidermal cells.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Why do we use this type of cell?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Because I just mentioned

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Neutrophil is a type of cell

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
that has a very large number of

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
active or unactive proteins.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Or its turnover is very fast.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
It is very active.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Compared to our epidermal cells,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
like you and me,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
the epidermal cells are basically

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
not very active.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
So its cytoskeleton,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
the cell skeleton,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
is relatively stable.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
So we went to see

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
the microRNAs

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
between these two cells.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And we found that

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
there is a difference

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
in the amount of microRNAs

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
in the epidermal cells.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So there are

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
340 microRNAs

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
in the epidermal cells.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
We found that

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
90 microRNAs are lower in Neutrophil.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Let me explain to you here.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Neutrophil cells

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
because we know that

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
in most cases,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
microRNAs suppress certain mRNAs

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
or suppress a certain

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
biological reaction.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
So what we want to take today

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
is to put it back

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
so that it can do its function

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
and slow it down.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
So we let it

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
put something in a faster cell

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
to slow it down.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
So we choose this lower

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Neutrophil.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
In these 90 targets,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
after we classify it a little bit,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
we have 50 candidates.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So these 50

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
microRNA families

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
are relatively low

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
in Neutrophil

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
compared to the epidermal cells.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
So now we're going to put it back

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
and see if we can

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
slow down the Neutrophil

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
recruitment.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
This is a little bit

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
more complicated,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
but this is our over-expression construct.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
How do we

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
express this thing?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
We can't express it in Neutrophil.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
So we have to use

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
a thing called Neutrophil-specific promotion.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
This kind of start

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
will only open and express

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
in Neutrophil.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
This is called Lysine.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
We put our

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
microRNA hairpin

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
in an intron,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
so it won't affect the gene expression.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
So it's like Neutrophil

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
expressing a microRNA.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
At the same time, how do we know

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
this gene?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
We designed the exon 1

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
to splice the dendrite 2 protein.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
This is very complicated,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
but this dendrite 2 protein is basically

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
a green protein.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Because it's all

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
a construct,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
it's all a gene

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
that turns down.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So if there is a microRNA,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
this cell will be green

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
and only occurs in Neutrophil.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
This is more complicated.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Then we put

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
all 50 targets here

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
into the structure of the hairpin

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and replace them one by one.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And then one by one,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
this is a single cell

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
of the hematoma.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
This is the hematoma.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
This is its egg yolk.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
This is its cell.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Then three days later,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
we will select

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
which hematoma

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
has Neutrophil

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
and which hematoma has dendrite 2 protein.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
After the selection,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
we will

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
inject

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
pseudomonas

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
directly into the

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
hematoma's ears.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
This will make it

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
look at the

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
green Neutrophil recruitment.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So the phenomenon we see

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
is like this.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
This is the hematoma's ears.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You can see the red bacteria here.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
They will come to the ears

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
to do their immune response.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
If we find

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
a microRNA over-expression,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
which is to express this microRNA

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
by this construct,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
you will see that

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
these Neutrophil

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
either haven't gotten here

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
or don't want to get here.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
So they didn't

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
get the successful recruitment.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
So from

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
our 50 candidates,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
we sifted out

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
9 microRNAs

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
with similar phenomena.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
They will have less

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
to the ears.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
So this is

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
how we

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
raise these 9 microRNAs

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
into the so-called

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
stable line.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Every cell

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
of this fish

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
has this construct

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
at the DNA level.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But only in Neutrophil

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
will it be expressed.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
So these 9

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
are our microRNAs.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
After we have

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
this stable transgenic line,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
we verify again

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
to infect its ears

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
or use another

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
so-called sterile inflammation,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
which is

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
non-infective

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
inflammation.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So we cut it off

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and look at Neutrophil's

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
recruitment.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
You will find that

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
in general,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
it is consistent

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
with our transgenic screen.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
This is the screen

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
on the page above.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
This microRNA199-3

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
has two models.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Whether it's infection

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
or tail wounding,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
the ratio of recruitment

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
is this gray bar,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
the contrast group.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
After expressing this microRNA,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
you will find that

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
it drops the most.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
So we want to study

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
some biological functions of

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
this microRNA199.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
First of all,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
we need to determine

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
the expression of

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
this microRNA199

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
compared to the baseline

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
in Neutrophil.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Because it may only

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
cause this phenomenon

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
when the computer crashes.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
So we did a

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
microRNA QRT

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
to measure

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
how much microRNA199

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
will affect other microRNAs.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
We found that

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
microRNA223 and microRNA227

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
are high microRNAs

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
in Neutrophil.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
But microRNA199,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
because we have overexpressed it,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
is about 1,000 times higher.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
So it means that

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
it is 1,000 times higher

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
than other microRNAs.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
So we are safe to assume that

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
the phenomenon of microRNA199

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
is really caused by

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
the overexpression of microRNA199,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
not because other microRNAs

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
are all dropped.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
At the same time,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
we need to see

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
whether the reduction of

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
recruitment is caused by

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
the overexpression of microRNA199

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
or its own

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
inability to develop

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
or functional differences.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
So we went to see

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
that the number of Neutrophils

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
in each fish

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
is similar to that of vectors,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
which means that

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
it is not caused by

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
a total reduction of Neutrophils.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Because the reduction of recruitment

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
you see today may be

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
because Neutrophils are less

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
so you can't see this phenomenon.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
So we need to see

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
whether the Neutrophils

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
are going to develop

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
or not.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
So this is a zebrafish.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
This is what we call a stable line.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Each Neutrophil is green.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
This is a vector.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
So you can see that

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Neutrophils are moving very,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
very fast.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
You can see that

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Neutrophils are moving very,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
very fast.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
So the question is

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
when the Neutrophils

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
are overexpressed,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
the Neutrophils will still move.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It's just that

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
it will still move,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
but it will move slower than others.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So it's possible that

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
it really doesn't want to go

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
or it just walks slowly.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
At least we know that

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
the zebrafish walks slowly.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
As for whether it doesn't want to go,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
we will study it later.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
What I want to introduce to you

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
is the zebrafish Neutrophil.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
No matter how similar it is to humans,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
it is still

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
not a human Neutrophil.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
But in our field,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
the biggest problem

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
of Neutrophil research is

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
that this human Neutrophil

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
is no longer fragmented,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
so it is difficult

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
to make any genetic

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
modifications or mutations.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
So in our field,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
the zebrafish Neutrophil is a

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
cell type called HL60.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
This cell type

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
is a Neutrophil's

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
anterior cell.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
In this anterior cell,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
it will be fragmented and split.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
We can make some genetic

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
modifications to it,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
and then divide it into Neutrophils.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
But it won't be a complete Neutrophil.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
It's just a Neutrophil similar to humans.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
At least it's human.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Because this is a microRNA,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
we don't want this microRNA

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
to be affected

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
in the process of splitting.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
So we had to adopt

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
an inducible system,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
that is, we can use a switch.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
What does this switch mean?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
It means that we first put this

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
new construct

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
into our HL60

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
cell,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
and then make a antigen,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
puromycin, to select it.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
So as long as there is

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
an HL60

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
in its gene,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
it can be immune to this antigen.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
When we need

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
this microRNA to be expressed,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
we give it a doxycycline,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
a chemical substance,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
a four-ring type,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
which is also an antigen

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
and an antibiotic.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
This stimulates the

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
hairpin in the middle

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and the green one will be expressed.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
This is a bit complicated.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Anyway, because we don't want

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
this microRNA to be expressed at any time,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
it will affect its splitting.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
So we use such an inducible system.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
We can share a few photos with you.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
So the normal cell is

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
dense, and then after splitting,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
some of it will die,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
but basically it is still splitting.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
You can see that this little bit of green

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
is the doxycycline

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
to turn it on.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Of course, the degree of green

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
is different,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
but these green cells successfully

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
split and express the microRNA we want.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
This microRNA199

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
is very important,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
and it is very lucky

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
that its Bermuda microRNA199

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
is exactly the same as the

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
human microRNA199 series,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
which is the series of 20 to 22

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
editing we mentioned earlier.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
The part I circled

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
is the 2nd to 8th editing

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
in the microRNA,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
which is called the seed sequence,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
which is its core binding.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It mainly relies on this seed sequence

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
to identify its target.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So if you think about it,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
it is actually a series of 6 to 7 edits.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Because we have 4 types of edits,

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
A, T, C, G,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
so it's 4 to 6 to 7 squares.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
This is actually quite specific.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
So the first thing we saw

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
was that we chose

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
this microRNA199 cell expression.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
We found that

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
it was only

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
when the switch was turned on,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
it was only the top line of

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
microRNA199,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and the other two microRNAs,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
the microRNA in the neutral field,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
had no effect.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
At the same time,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
we also used another random microRNA,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
microRNA100.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
This is not something we are interested in.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It's just because I'm afraid

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
that this construct itself

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
will cause a sequelae.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
So we put these cells

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
in a thing called a transwell.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This transwell,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I'll explain it to you.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It's a kind of

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
nipple groove.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
The groove above

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
is where we put our cells.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
At the bottom of this groove

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
is a small hole.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
This small hole is not big enough

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
for the cells to fall in,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
but the cells can squeeze in.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's a bit like the neutral field

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
that we introduced earlier.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
It can squeeze the transwell

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
into the tissue.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
At the bottom,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
we put something that can attract them.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
In this case,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
we put something called FMLP.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
It's a small peptide

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
that the bacteria release.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
We found that

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
if we

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
use FMLP

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
to attract it,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
and if we don't activate it,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
these three cells

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
will go down

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
in the same way.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
You can see that the white bars are the same.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Similarly,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
if you give it a construct,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
whether it's an empty vector,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
199 or 100,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
but you don't give it

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
anything that can attract it,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
they won't go over.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
You have to squeeze this hole

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
to consume energy,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
so it won't do anything meaningful.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
However,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
if you give it

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
FMLP again,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
you will find that

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
this random microRNA

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
is similar to our empty vector,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
but only when you express 199,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
its penetrability

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
will decrease.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
It's exactly the same as what we saw

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
in the Bermuda Triangle.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
It can't recruit

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
to the place we want.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
This proves that this microRNA 199

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
is useful in both

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
human and Bermuda Triangle systems.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Next, we want to ask

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
what is the target of this 199

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
to make it useful.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
We need to

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
identify the mechanism below it.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
This is a

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
adult Bermuda triangle.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Bermuda triangle

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
is different from humans.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Its structure is not in the bones,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
but in its growth.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
This Bermuda triangle is called kidney marrow.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Let's take this kidney marrow out.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You can see that these green cells

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
are the neutrophils we saw earlier.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Let's use the method of

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
eukaryotic cells

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
to separate the cells.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Because it's green,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
it has green light,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
let's use RNA

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
to measure its RNA level.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Let's see

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
the expression of each RNA.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Do you remember

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
what I said earlier?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
This microRNA will target

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
the target mRNA.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
If it successfully targets,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
the mRNA may be reduced.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
So the level of expression

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
will decrease.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Surprisingly,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
as I mentioned earlier,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
the neutrophils are not

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
separated.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
However,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
we can see from the

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
profile of the RNA

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
that some cells are

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
separated.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Some cells

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
are

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
separated.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
This is very illogical.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
These cells are not

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
separated.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Why are these

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
cells separated?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
First, let's see

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
if this is true.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Let's verify

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
its expression

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
by using RNA.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
We found that

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
CDK1 is a cell cycle gene.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
It is not on our

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
reduction list.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
CDK2 and CDK5

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
are all cell cycle genes.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Indeed, when you express

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
microRNA199,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
the sequence is true.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
However, there is no explanation.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Let me explain to you

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
the cell cycle.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
In the case of cell splitting,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
there are two

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
same colored cells.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
The DNA replication

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
will be copied

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
into the so-called double cell.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
The mitosis

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
will be captured by the

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
microtubule and split into two cells.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
In general,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
when we use

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
HL60,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
we will find that

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
it depends on the amount of DNA.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
There is a green peak.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
This is the amount of DNA

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
in a single cell.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
The S phase

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
is the replication.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
When we go to the G2 phase,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
it is already determined that

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
it is a double cell.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Therefore, the amount of DNA

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
in a single cell

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
is the same.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Let's take a look at

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
the neutrophil

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
represented by

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
the light-C promoter.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Indeed,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
the neutrophil is not

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
replicated.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It is in the case of

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
G0 and G1.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Before we start

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
to study CDK2,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
we need to understand

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
the microRNA199 sequence.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This is the seed sequence.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It is the binding sequence

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
at the core.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
In the human CDK2 gene

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and the Danish CDK2 gene,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
there are places

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
that can bind directly.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
G will bind to C,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
A will bind to T, etc.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
They are divided into 6-mer sites

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
and 7-mer sites.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
They are

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
predicted to bind.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
We can use

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
computer algorithms

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
to predict that G0 and G1

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
can bind directly to CDK2.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Is it true?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
We need to verify it.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Therefore,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
we created

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
two versions

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
of CDK2.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
One is that

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
the predicted binding site

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
can be

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
replicated.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
If

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
G0 and G1

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
can be replicated,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
then the predicted binding site

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
can be replaced.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
If G0 and G1

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
can be replaced,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
then the predicted binding site

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
can be replaced.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
We created

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
a Luciferase assay.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Let me introduce it to you.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
There are two constructs.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
First,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
the CDK2

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
3'-UTR

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
is placed here.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Next,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
the R

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
is placed here.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Finally,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
the F

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
is placed here.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
These are the two constructs.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
They do not change.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
If

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
the CDK2

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
3'-UTR

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
is replaced,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
then the R

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Luciferase

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
will be degraded.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
If

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
the CDK2

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
3'-UTR

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
is replaced,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
then the R

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Luciferase

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
will be degraded.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
If

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
the CDK2

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
3'-UTR

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
is replaced,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
then the R

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Luciferase

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
will be degraded.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
If the CDK2

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
3'-UTR

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
is replaced,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
then the R

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Luciferase

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
will be degraded.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
If the CDK2

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
3'-UTR

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
is replaced,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
then the R

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Luciferase

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
will be degraded.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
The reason why the CDK2

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
3'-UTR

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
is degraded is that

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
the CDK2

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
3'-UTR

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
is replaced.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
The CDK2

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
3'-UTR

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
is replaced.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
The CDK2

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
3'-UTR

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
is replaced.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
When you express

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
the vector,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
we set it as the baseline,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
because the vector is empty.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
However, when you express

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
the 199,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
the CDK2

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
3'-UTR

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
will be degraded.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
If you change the position

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
of the CDK2,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
the CDK2

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
3'-UTR

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
will be degraded.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
The microRNA 199

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
can suppress

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
the mRNA of CDK2.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
An important experiment

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
is to see

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
if the 199 can suppress

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
the CDK2,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
if I put the CDK2

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
in a version

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
that suppresses the CDK2,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
can I save

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
or rescue

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
or restore the CDK2?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
we put the CDK2

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
in the 199

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
and marked it

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
with a red mark.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
The CDK2

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
cannot be suppressed

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
by the 199,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
because we changed

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
the suppression point.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
This is

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
the result.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
As you can see in this video,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
red or white,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
because red plus green is white,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
the cells move faster

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
than the green cells.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
The statistics show

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
that the CDK2

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
can restore the CDK2.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
The CDK2

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
is not the only

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
CDK2,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
but it is an important

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
CDK2.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
As you can see,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
the CDK2

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
is not the only

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
CDK2,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
but it is an important

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
CDK2.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
As you can see,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the CDK2

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
is not the only

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
CDK2,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
but it is an important

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
CDK2.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
As you can see,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
the CDK2

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
is not the only

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
CDK2.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
As you can see,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
the CDK2

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
is not the only

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
CDK2.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
As you can see,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
the CDK2

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
is not the only

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
CDK2.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
There is another,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
CDK2

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
elinfo.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
The CDK2

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
is not the only

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
CDK2.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
The CDK2

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
is not the only

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
CDK2.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
As you can see,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
the CDK2

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
is not the only

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
CDK2.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
There is another

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
CDK2

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
that is

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
not the only

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
CDK2.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
There is another

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
CDK2

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
that is

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
not the only

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
CDK2.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
There is another

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
CDK2

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
that is

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
not the only

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
CDK2.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
There is another

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
CDK2

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
that is

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
not the only

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
CDK2.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
There is another

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
CDK2

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
that is

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
not the only

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
CDK2.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
There is another

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
CDK2

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
that is

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
not the only

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
CDK2.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
The last one

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
is

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
basically

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
the research of CDK2

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
because it is a very important protein

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
for cell cycle

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
or cell division.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
So most of the research is on cancer

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
or cell division

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
or cell division.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
In fact, other aspects

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
have not been studied at all.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
So

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
the first thing we need to do is to make sure

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
whether the CDK2

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
is expressed in the cell of

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
the protein.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
This is a previous study.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
They found that CDK2

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
is not only expressed, but also

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
if you do LPS, which is the stimulation of the endocrine,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
it will still rise.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
This means that it is not only functional,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
but also

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
has a reaction

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
to neutrophil stimulation.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
This is the

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
level of RNA.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
If you look at the level of protein,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
you will find that most of the CDK2

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
C is the cytosol, N is the nucleus.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Most of them are in the cell.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Although you may say that

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
it will be a little bit after eating,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
most of them are still in the cell.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
In our system,

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
we

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
draw blood and then separate

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
human neutrophils,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
such as the neutrophils on you and me.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
What we are talking about now is

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
the cell skeleton of its actin.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
It is found that after the cell skeleton

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
has been stimulated,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
there is a single

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
polarization.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
This depi is its nucleus.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
You will find that CDK2

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
is like the previous report.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Regardless of the fact that

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
there is no CDK2 in the nucleus,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
most of the green part and the blue part

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
are actually a little bit apart.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Most of them are actually in the cell tissue,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
not in the nucleus.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
This is also confirmed by the previous research.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It also proves that

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
the CDK2 we see in our system

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
is actually in the nucleus.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
As mentioned earlier...

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Sorry.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
The time is almost up.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Sorry.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
I don't know how many pages you have left,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
but you may need to speed up later.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Okay, I got it.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
In order to separate

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
the functions of the traditional CDK2,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
because the traditional CDK2 is studied

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
and replicated in DNA,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
we use NU6140 today.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
This is the replication of the

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
replicated CDK2,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
and this is the replication of the

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
replicated DNA.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
We found that only when you

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
replicate the CDK2,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
but you replicate the DNA,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
there is an effect.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
So the role of CDK2 today

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
is beyond the function of

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
DNA replication

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
that we traditionally recognize.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
In both of our

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
research models,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
we found that only when you

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
replicate the CDK2,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
there is such a replication recruitment,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
which is to replicate its

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
path to the original place,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
and then when you replicate the DNA

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
replication, there is no effect.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
In order to be afraid that

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
if we replicate the CDK2,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
it will directly kill the cell,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
we chose two inhibitors

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
to replicate the CDK2.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
It can be

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
washed away.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
As you can see,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
the speed of the cell

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
is still normal.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Once we give it this drug,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
it will slow down.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Once we wash

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
this drug away,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
it will return to normal in 1-2 hours.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
It means that we just

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
brake it a little bit,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
we don't kill it,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
but do some irreversible reactions.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
This may be very helpful

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
in terms of treatment,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
we can suppress it

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
and wash it away.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
It can solve

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
such a problem.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
In addition, we need to see

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
what the function of CDK2 is.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
It is a gene model.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
If you look at it from the point of view of medicine,

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
it will often have off-targeting,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
which is some non-specific functions.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
So we just put the CDK2,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
this is CDK2 and its

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
binding part 2,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
on the CDK2.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
After the CDK2 is off-targeted,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
it will not be able

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
to neutralize

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
its target.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
The result of this

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
is that it will

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
occupy all of its

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
targets,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
because it occupies

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
the macromolecule.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Second, all the cyclins will also be occupied

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
by the macromolecule.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
So we call this strategy

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
dominant-negative.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Then we put it in the bimolecule.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
You will find that if you express

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
such a red CDK2 normally,

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
it will be very happy.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
On the other hand, if you express

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
this dominant-negative,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
this CDK2,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
you will find that the cells will not move at all.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
But the interesting thing is that

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
when you soak

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
this whole fish in

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
a chemical substance

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
to attract these neutrophils,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
you will find that

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
they will still move.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
They will still go to

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
this macromolecule.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
It's just that it's going slower,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and the directionality seems to be lost.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
If you compare it to what you saw earlier,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
this is normal.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
In the absence of speech,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
they are lazy and don't move much.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
On the other hand,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
when they speak,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
they are still lazy.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
It's just that they move slowly,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
and the trajectory is not so straight.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Let's look at this thing

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
with a higher degree of detection.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Let's look at their cell skeleton.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Generally speaking, in a moving neutrophil,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
you will find that its stable actin,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
which is a mark

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
of its actin,

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
will be behind its cell.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
So this green will follow the purple.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So this green is always a mark

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
of the cell.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
But when you express

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
the dominant and negative constructs

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
of CDK2,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
you will find that the cell is not dead or not moving.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
It's just that the green doesn't know where to go.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
It's like walking left and right.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
It doesn't know where to move.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
So this also tells us

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
that there may be some problems with thresholding.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
In order to make sure

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
that what we see is

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
caused by

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
CDK2,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
we used

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
a new cell

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
to knock off

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
this gene.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
So we found that

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
when we removed CDK2,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
our neutrophils

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
didn't move much.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
At the same time,

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
in order to make sure that this removal is a deliberate removal,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
if we put CDK2 back,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
you will find that

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
there is a rescue

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
to restore its movement speed.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
So when you put

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
this DNA back,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
of course, it has no effect.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
So the phenomenon we see

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
is specifically caused by CDK2.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
So what we just mentioned

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
is that the cell looks drunk

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and walks left and right.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
So let me introduce to you

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
this neutrophil.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
In order to make it move,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
we need to activate

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
the leading edge

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
and the trailing edge.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
The signaling in the front

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
uses two proteins

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
as the readout.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
We found that

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
in a human cell,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
if you knock off

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
CDK2,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
not really knock it off,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
but just suppress

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
its expression,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
the signal in the front

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
will decrease.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
In contrast,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
the signal in the back,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
the myosin,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
is usually behind the cell,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
and the fluoride

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
will mark the leading edge of the cell.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
The leading edge and the trailing edge

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
are separated,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
so we know that the cell is upward polarizing.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
But when you take CDK2 off,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
the polarization disappears.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
This means that this cell

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
is like what we see in the fish.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Finally,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
let's switch to

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
a mouse model.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
After CDK2 is taken off,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
the mouse is only relatively small,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
and it can't reproduce.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
But the problem is that

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
some of its functions are unknown.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
So we did a

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
post-mortem on this mouse.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
We took a post-mortem on it

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
and then collected its saliva

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
to see what happened.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Let's skip

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
the graph first.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
As you can see,

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
in this circle,

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
when CDK2 is taken off,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
there are fewer dots

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
compared to

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
the dots here.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
This means that

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
there are fewer neutrophils

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
entering the germ.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
While there are fewer neutrophils

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
entering the germ,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
we found that

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
in a normal situation,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
the neutrophil

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
in the germ

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
has a higher proportion.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
The neutrophil

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
in the germ

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
has a higher proportion than

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
in a normal mouse.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
When it is taken off,

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
the neutrophil

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
will move to the surrounding blood

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
and go to the circulatory system.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
That's why you see

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
this decrease.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
However, if there is a problem

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
with the neutrophil,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
the neutrophil will stay in the blood

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
with a higher proportion.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
At the same time,

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
the neutrophil will be

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
less likely to be infected.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
To summarize,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
neutrophils move in

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
2D and 3D.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
One of them moves

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
on the surface,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
while the other

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
moves on the leading edge

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and trailing edge.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
We found that

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
in human cells,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
if you suppress the CDK2,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
which is a 2D migration,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
the CDK2 will move

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
on the leading edge

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and trailing edge.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
When you suppress the CDK2,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
it will move on the leading edge

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
and trailing edge.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
However, the CDK2

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
will move on the leading edge

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
and trailing edge.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
This means that

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
in the 3D ring,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
the CDK2 will move on the leading edge

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and trailing edge.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
This means that

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
in the 3D ring,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
the CDK2 will move on the leading edge

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and trailing edge.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
However, if you suppress the CDK2,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
the CDK2 will move

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
on the leading edge

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and trailing edge.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
This is the summary of

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
the CDK2 migration in the

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Bermuda Triangle.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It is a very useful

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
in human and mouse systems.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It is a conserved feature.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
It is a conserved feature.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It is a conserved feature.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
The last data

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
is the model of

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Bermuda Triangle.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It is a model of

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
a bacteria-type

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
all-body infection

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
that will kill itself.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
It is a model of

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
a bacteria-type

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
all-body infection

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
that will kill itself.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It also increases

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
the dose of the infection.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It also increases

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
the dose of the infection.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It also increases

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
the dose of the infection.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It also increases

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
the survival rate

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
of Bermuda Triangle.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
It also increases

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
the survival rate

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
of Bermuda Triangle.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It also increases

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
the survival rate

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
of Bermuda Triangle.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.300
Before wards

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.000
followed by

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
the hospital ward.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
All Wards

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
™

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
are related to

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
cell migration.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
The CDK2

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
is also needed

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
by the neutral field.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
The CDK2

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and its downstream

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
can improve

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
the survival rate

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
of Bermuda Triangle.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
We are working on

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
the CDK2's

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
downstream substrate,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
its target

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and its binding factor.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
This is our lab.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
This is my boss,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Deng Qin,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and my committee.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I have an excellent undergraduate

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
who has been helping me with experiments.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Thank you.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Let's give him a round of applause.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Do you have any questions

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
for Yihui?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I have a question.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It's more detailed.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I don't have much knowledge

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
about flow cytometry.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
You used flow cytometry

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
to quantify

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
the amount of RNA.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Is it possible to

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
label the RNA

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
using FISH

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and then run the flow

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
to compare

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
the changes in the amount?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I'm sorry.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I might be talking too fast.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Our RNA levels

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
are all quantified

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
using PCR.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
We don't use flow

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
to quantify RNA.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So, in this slide,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
you don't use flow cytometry,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
but...

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
We use flow

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
to separate

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
the neutral field

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
from the entire substrate

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
to do sequencing.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Each red dot

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
is a cell.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
This is a flow chart.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
We separate the cells

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and extract the RNA

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
to compare

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
the amount of mRNA

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
in each cell.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
In this chart,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
we only use PCR

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
to verify

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
whether the sequencing is correct.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I see.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Thank you.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Do you have

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
any other questions?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I'm sorry.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I might be talking too fast.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Okay.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
If you don't have any questions,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I'll stop the recording.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
You can continue

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
to chat here.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
You can email me if you have any questions.
