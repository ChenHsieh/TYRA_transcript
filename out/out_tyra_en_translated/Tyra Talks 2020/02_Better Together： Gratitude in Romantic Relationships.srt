1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, everyone. I'm your host, Sui-An.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm very happy to have you all here today.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm very happy to have you all here today.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The topic is Better Together, Gratitude in Romantic Relationships.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Before we start, I'd like to talk about two things.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First, I'd like to briefly talk about how we're going to do the presentation.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Dr. Zhang will have a few segments in the presentation.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you have any questions, you can leave them in the chat box.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Or during the presentation, the speaker may pause a few times.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can ask questions during that time.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
During the presentation, because we're live, I'm going to mute everyone's microphones.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Please understand.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Today's presentation is hosted by TAIRA.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
TAIRA is a non-profit organization.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We hope that young Taiwanese scholars all over the world

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
will have the opportunity to share their research online.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Whether you're in the same field or in a different field,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you'll have the opportunity to discuss and learn from each other.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you're not a TAIRA member yet,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
please go to the TAIRA Project website to sign up to become a member.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you're already a member,

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
we're recruiting speakers for the second half of this year.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please feel free to register to become a speaker for the second half of this year.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is the agenda for today's presentation.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to briefly introduce Dr. Zhang's academic experience.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Dr. Zhang currently serves as a post-doctoral postdoc researcher

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
at the Central Institute of Sociology.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Her current research project is called

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Unmanned Mobility-Affected Experimental Situations.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Her main field of research is psychology.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Her research topics include emotions, interpersonal relationships, and culture.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Before she returned to Taiwan to serve as a post-doctoral postdoc researcher,

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
she graduated from the Department of Psychology at the National Taiwan University

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and obtained a bachelor's degree.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
She then continued to study at the National Taiwan University Psychological Research Institute

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and obtained a master's degree.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The topic of her master's thesis is actually a continuation of today's topic.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Her topic is how to express gratitude and adapt to a partner's lifestyle.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
After graduating from her master's,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
she went straight to the University of North Carolina in the United States

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
to study for a doctorate degree at the University of North Carolina.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I find her research topics very interesting.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There are several main parts.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For example, if we express gratitude in our daily lives,

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
does it mean that people from different cultures have different cultural differences?

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Or, can gratitude make us a better person, a better version of ourselves?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Or, if we talk about intimate relationships,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
what kind of role do partners play in intimate relationships or physical contact?

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Another part is the so-called self-exceeding emotion.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What does it have to do with a person's participation in society?

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I find Dr. Zhang's research very interesting.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What's interesting is that it's not a research in a ivory tower,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but rather how we can apply theory in our daily lives

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to make psychology a very practical and helpful science for humans.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Before I hand over to Dr. Zhang,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have a personal story to share with you.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Dr. Zhang is a very important mentor who led me into the field of psychology.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
When I was in college, I was his research assistant.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I think Dr. Zhang is someone who cares a lot about humans.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I think his research is not just about knowledge.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He really cares about how we can make humans a better human being.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, I won't go into too much detail.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's welcome Dr. Zhang to share his useful speech with us.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you, Yian, for the introduction.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was a very complete speech.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I feel like I wasn't as serious as I was when I was a host last week.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you very much.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's get started.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The topic of Yian's speech,

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Gradually Romantic Relationships,

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
was written by me.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can see it on PowerPoint.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If there is an emergency,

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
let me talk about it first.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If there is an emergency,

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
like if I suddenly lose connection or can't see the slides or something,

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
but I can't see everyone's chat,

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yian, please send me a message.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My phone is next to me.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You can still see it.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If there is something like this, please let me know.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
All right.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I wrote the topic myself.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What you see on PowerPoint now

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
is purely because the word romantic is too long.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It will squeeze the relationship to the next line.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think it's ugly, so I changed it.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But most of today's content will still be in Romantic Relationships.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Although it's not just Romantic Relationships,

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
most of it will be here.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is the first one.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The second one is

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't have much content to prepare today.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So if you're in the middle,

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
is there anything you want to clarify?

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Or I didn't make it clear.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then you need to clarify.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Or is there anything you want to discuss?

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Some ideas.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
In fact, I welcome everyone to put it out in the middle.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
As for the method,

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yian has already introduced it.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you can put it out.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If we have a chance,

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we can discuss it.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The third one is what Yian just said.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Like my master's thesis.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's true that the content I'm going to talk about today

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
is what I've been doing all the way.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But I'm not going to talk about that today.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There are some other related studies.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I welcome everyone to ask questions.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We may be able to talk about these past studies

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
during the time of questions.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm going to focus on a few new ones today.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And then we're actually halfway there.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The reason is because I don't want to...

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because I don't know if you've heard of my previous stuff.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm afraid I'll repeat it later.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a waste of time.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But if you don't know,

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you're welcome to ask questions.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then we can mention it by the way.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, let's get started.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, I'm going to talk a little slower now.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
As Yian just said,

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
a large part of my research all the way

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is about the feeling of gratitude.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In interpersonal relationships,

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
especially in intimate relationships,

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
there's a lot of influence

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
between people who are close to each other.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This kind of emotion,

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
which we usually call emotion,

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
is generated from intimacy

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and how it can be reversed

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to influence the quality of intimacy, etc.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In literature,

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
there is a major theory

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that talks about the function of gratitude

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
in interpersonal relationships and intimacy.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
From a functionalist perspective,

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
we're going to talk about its function.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The conclusion of this theory is actually quite simple.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Gratitude is...

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The function of its evolution

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
is to help us promote

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and maintain high-quality intimacy.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
To be more specific,

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
this is how it works.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's imagine that

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
we're walking around like this in our daily lives.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Suddenly, one day,

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
at a certain moment,

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
a person,

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
no matter who it is,

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
a stranger, a close person,

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
anyone,

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
did something to us

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that is worth praising.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
For example,

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
today,

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I forgot to bring my keys.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I forgot to bring my keys.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Then I called my wife.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
She said,

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
wait for me.

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm nearby.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll send your keys back.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
She did this for me.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
For me,

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
it's very...

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In terms of evolution...

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, let's not talk about evolution.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
For my life,

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it's very useful.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a very effective thing.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In terms of evolution,

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
of course,

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
as an individual,

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
how can we recognize

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that these people

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
will do something effective, useful, and helpful to us?

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Some people won't.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We need to interact with these people for a long time.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't interact with another group of people for a long time.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This ability becomes very important,

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
very functional,

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and very effective.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is why gratitude appears.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's say my wife

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
brought my keys back today.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
She just went out

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and brought my keys back.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then I'll have this emotion.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The emotion of gratitude.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a bit like

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
there's a light bulb in my head.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Then it lights up.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That light bulb is the feeling of gratitude.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It reminds me

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that the person I'm interacting with

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
is a good social partner.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He is a person

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
who needs to interact well

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in my future life.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is the first step.

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay?

211
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
My feeling of gratitude.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But just the feeling is not enough.

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What I just said is important.

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How do I fix this person

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
in my future?

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So gratitude

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
will be very natural.

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Everyone must have experience like this.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The feeling of gratitude

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
will naturally

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
produce a grateful expression.

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
For example, the simplest

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I would say thank you.

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is a very natural expression.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Of course, everyone can think of

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
many different ways of expression.

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is what I just mentioned.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
When I was doing cultural research,

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I was doing cultural psychology research.

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Cultural research is another

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
huge field.

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I'm not doing all of it.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When I was doing cultural psychology research,

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I was looking at

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
people from different cultures

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
expressing their feelings of gratitude.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But no matter which culture it is,

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
no matter how it is expressed,

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it is expressed anyway.

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Through this expression,

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
what I want to do is

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
let my wife

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
know that

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I am a person

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
who knows how to be grateful.

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I feel it.

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I let her know.

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is very important

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
because it will let my

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
social partner know

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
that this person

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
is a person who knows how to be grateful.

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So she can recognize

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
that I am working hard for her.

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
My efforts for her

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
will not be in vain.

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In the future,

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
she will want to

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
interact with me

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
in theory.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is still theory.

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
She will want to interact with me.

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then we can form a...

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know if this example is good or not.

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But you can imagine

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
that there are two atoms

267
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and they are far apart.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It doesn't matter.

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But slowly they will

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
get closer and closer

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
to each other.

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Then they will be fixed

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
as a pair.

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is the concept.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then they will be fixed.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This kind of pair

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
will help a lot

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
when facing

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the risk of evolution,

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
environmental challenges, etc.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This is the phenomenal level.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
On the psychological level,

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
there is a very important concept

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
in the literature.

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It is used to...

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It is a very strong concept

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that predicts the quality of the relationship

288
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and maintains it.

289
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It is called

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Perceived Partner Responsiveness.

291
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
TPRM.

292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
How to translate this?

293
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Actually, I'm not sure

294
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
how to translate this.

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Perceived Partner Responsiveness.

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What does this mean?

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's talk about the first two words.

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's simple.

299
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Perceived Partner.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I see a characteristic

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
in my partner.

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This characteristic

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
is called

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Perceived Responsiveness.

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
As a person,

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I see this characteristic

307
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
in my partner.

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The first two words,

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Perceived Partner.

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Something perceiving the partner.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What is Responsiveness?

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Responsiveness is

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
my partner.

314
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I see that my partner

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
wants to take care of me.

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He wants to meet my expectations

317
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and needs.

318
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This motivation

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
is called Responsiveness.

320
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If I see

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
a quality in my partner

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
that wants to take care of me,

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
then I perceive

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
some responsiveness in my partner.

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is it.

326
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is my subjective

327
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
perception of my partner.

328
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What kind of person

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
is my partner?

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This is my subjective perception.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This perception

332
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
can be found to be

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
a strong factor

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
in maintaining and stabilizing

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the relationship.

336
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So,

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
on a psychological level,

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the expression of Gratitude

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
conveys

340
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the feeling of Gratitude.

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
As I said,

342
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the feeling of Gratitude

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
is to let me know

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
that my partner

345
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
is a good social partner.

346
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Specifically,

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
what kind of partner is it?

348
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's a Responsive partner.

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The feeling of Gratitude

350
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
is like

351
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
when you book online shopping.

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
When you book online shopping,

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
a box will be sent to your home.

354
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The box is Gratitude.

355
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When you open the box,

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
it's filled with Responsiveness.

357
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's like a carrier.

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
When you open the box,

359
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you can see

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the Responsiveness of your partner.

361
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
On the other hand,

362
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the feeling of Gratitude

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
when we show it

364
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to our partner,

365
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
it's the feeling of Gratitude.

366
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
However,

367
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
when the box is opened,

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
it's also the feeling of Responsiveness.

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Through the exchange of Responsiveness,

370
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
the relationship stabilizes.

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So,

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm going to talk about some...

373
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is the theory part.

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm going to talk about some

375
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
real-life research

376
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
to support this theory.

377
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
By the way,

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't have a lot of videos.

379
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's usually like this.

380
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I stop for a night

381
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and then I keep talking.

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So if you want this,

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
for example,

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
a citation

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
or related information,

386
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
you can ask me in person.

387
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No problem.

388
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay.

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
There is a research

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that is done like this.

391
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't know if you know

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the structure of

393
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
the American University Sisters' Association.

394
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
In the first week

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
of their freshman year,

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
at least in Virginia,

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
in the first week of their freshman year,

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
at the American University Sisters' Association,

399
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the little sister,

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the freshman,

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
will be assigned

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to a big sister,

403
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
for example,

404
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
a sophomore,

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
a sophomore in college.

406
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
these sophomore students

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
are responsible for

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
taking care of their little sister.

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the funny thing is

412
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
that the first week

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
is anonymous.

414
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So the little sister

415
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
actually doesn't know

416
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
who their big sister is.

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Only their big sister

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
has to take care of her

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
little sister in silence.

420
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's like the Little Angels.

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is the first week.

422
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then,

423
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
after the first week,

424
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
there is an opening speech.

425
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's like,

426
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
who is your big sister?

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Then

428
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
they will become

429
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
a pair.

430
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This research

431
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
uses this opportunity.

432
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm going to talk about this research now.

433
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This opportunity

434
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
during the first week

435
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
to ask these little sisters,

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
how much do you think

437
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
your big sister

438
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
takes care of you?

439
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How grateful are you to her?

440
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Even though you don't know who she is,

441
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
how grateful are you to her?

442
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
How much do you think she takes care of you?

443
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
These two phenomena,

444
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
one is the feeling of gratitude,

445
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the other is

446
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
perceived responsiveness.

447
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Then they measure this thing.

448
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Then,

449
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
they use this thing to predict

450
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and reveal

451
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
who your big sister is.

452
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Who are the big sisters of these little friends?

453
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
After a month,

454
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the satisfaction of the relationship between the two parties.

455
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Then he found

456
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
in the first week,

457
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
the gratitude of the little sister

458
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
will predict

459
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
two people after a month.

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Two people are

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
satisfied with the relationship between the two of them.

462
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Then this degree is

463
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the first week

464
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
little sister's perceived responsiveness

465
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to terminate.

466
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is a

467
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
display of

468
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
gratitude can predict

469
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
subjective evaluation of the relationship,

470
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
stability,

471
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
some degree of stability indicators,

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and is a long-term effect of a

473
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
related study.

474
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
In terms of intimacy,

475
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
there is another study,

476
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
which is very similar.

477
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He asked the recipient

478
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
every day,

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I remember it was 28 days,

480
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
3 weeks,

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
3 weeks,

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
21 days,

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
every day,

484
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
he asked the recipient to answer

485
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
gratitude,

486
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
did he express gratitude to you?

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Did he express gratitude to you?

488
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Did he express gratitude to you?

489
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
How grateful are you

490
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
to him?

491
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Then

492
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
thank you?

493
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This degree is a

494
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
display.

495
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Finally,

496
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
how committed are you

497
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to the relationship?

498
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That is to say,

499
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
this is called loyalty.

500
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I think loyalty is a bit strange.

501
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
How serious are you?

502
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
How convinced are you of this relationship?

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Then put in this way.

504
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then you can imagine,

505
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
because it is a long-term

506
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
study of 21 days,

507
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
so every day,

508
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
if the data is drawn,

509
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
there will be ups and downs,

510
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
high and low.

511
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So to some extent,

512
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
this study is actually a bit like

513
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
an experiment,

514
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
or what we usually call a type experiment.

515
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because if one day I write high,

516
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
that is, I am in the high

517
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
experimental group,

518
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and then one day I write low,

519
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that is, I am now in the low experimental group,

520
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
high, low, high, low,

521
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I will have

522
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
all kinds of experimental situations.

523
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Everyone can imagine this way.

524
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So to some extent it is a bit like a type experiment.

525
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Of course, such a situation is

526
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
there are many recipients,

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
each group will have many recipients.

528
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What did they find?

529
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
They found that

530
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the first study I just talked about

531
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
was about

532
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
grateful, grateful

533
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
side, accept the benefits,

534
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
grateful to this side of the person.

535
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But my other

536
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
study, he found that

537
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
when my partner expressed gratitude to me,

538
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I accepted the side of gratitude.

539
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If my partner

540
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
expressed gratitude to me,

541
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
if my partner expressed gratitude to me today,

542
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
at the same time,

543
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
today I will have more

544
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
commitment to our relationship.

545
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So

546
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
on the other hand,

547
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
he supported this theory,

548
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Find, Remind, My Theory,

549
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
this theory,

550
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
it is true that expressing gratitude is effective,

551
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
it can help us fix

552
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
accept gratitude,

553
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
first good to us,

554
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and then accept our gratitude

555
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
.

556
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Then I will talk about the last

557
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
study,

558
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
the last study, it is a complete

559
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
experiment, the question he asked

560
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
was a little different,

561
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
instead of saying that he wanted to

562
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
examine the phenomenon of this theory,

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
that is, on the phenomenon of gratitude,

564
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
can it help us maintain our relationship?

565
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What he wanted to ask more was

566
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
what kind of way

567
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
to express gratitude and maintain a relationship?

568
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He revealed the past literature,

569
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
he said, you see,

570
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
gratitude can really maintain a relationship,

571
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but what kind of behavior,

572
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
what kind of action,

573
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you can even say that it is an action

574
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to maintain a relationship.

575
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
In fact, it is a bit like the cultural research I did,

576
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but he did not ask about culture,

577
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
he did not look at the difference between cultures,

578
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
he looked at whether there was

579
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
a general action.

580
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
In this

581
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
literature on interpersonal relationships,

582
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
everyone can try it later,

583
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
there is an action in the literature on interpersonal relationships

584
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
that can

585
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
predict the maintenance of

586
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
this relationship,

587
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
for example,

588
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
when I am talking,

589
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I touch my nose while

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I grab my nose like this,

591
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
or I will be used to grabbing my head,

592
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
or I am used to sitting on the chair,

593
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
what I am doing now is rotating,

594
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
rotating,

595
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and these are not meaningful behaviors.

596
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Everyone will have something like this

597
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
when they talk,

598
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
if we imitate this behavior of other people,

599
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
for example, I am talking now,

600
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
then I will grab my nose,

601
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
then you also listen and it seems to be

602
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
something like that.

603
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It seems to have nothing to do with what we are talking about.

604
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But they find that

605
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
when we have a conversation or

606
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
one talks, one listens,

607
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
to ask the speaker,

608
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
that is me,

609
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
for example,

610
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
ask me how much I like

611
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the person in front of me

612
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
who listens to me or talks to me.

613
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
People who are imitated

614
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
will feel that they prefer the person in front of them.

615
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It seems that he and this person

616
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
have the same pain.

617
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The two people are

618
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
relatively close in frequency.

619
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then this research can

620
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
be done in the past.

621
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You call a

622
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
experimental group,

623
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
then the professor will come

624
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and ask him to give him a manuscript,

625
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
casually ask him to speak a little speech.

626
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Then in the process of asking him to speak,

627
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
call the experimental group to imitate his actions.

628
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Imitate his actions without discrimination.

629
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Of course, this research will ask

630
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
the speaker

631
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
to say

632
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
how strange you think the other person is,

633
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
how deliberate

634
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
you have been,

635
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
how strange you are,

636
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and if you notice that you are being imitated,

637
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
let's delete it first.

638
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
We only leave those who do not notice

639
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and do not feel that they are being imitated,

640
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
but are actually being imitated.

641
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
As a result,

642
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
there is another group,

643
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the control group,

644
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
which is not deliberately imitated.

645
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The group of people who are being imitated

646
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
will prefer the experimental group,

647
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and in the future

648
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
they will prefer the experimental group.

649
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
In the past research,

650
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I found this.

651
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Therefore,

652
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I want to talk about this research,

653
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
probably everyone knows

654
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
what I am going to do.

655
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It is to trigger the feeling of gratitude

656
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
in the laboratory

657
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
,

658
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and then see

659
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
if the person who has the feeling of gratitude

660
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
will run to imitate other people's behavior.

661
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Use this kind of

662
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
secretly imitating, subconsciously

663
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
imitate other people's behavior

664
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
to promote the relationship between the two people in the future.

665
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Let's talk about the conclusion first.

666
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The conclusion is, of course,

667
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
suppose

668
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
my wife sent me the key

669
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and I felt very grateful,

670
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
then I said thank you to her.

671
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
In the process,

672
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I may even forget to say thank you,

673
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but I will start to subconsciously imitate

674
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
some of her actions.

675
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
After she gave me the key,

676
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
she was going to leave,

677
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and I started to feel

678
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
that Zhang Yiping was more friendly,

679
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and I felt better.

680
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Something like this.

681
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But the conclusion is this.

682
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I like this research very much.

683
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This is a team from Singapore

684
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
in 2015 or 2016.

685
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He did it very,

686
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
very carefully.

687
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
This is also another feature of

688
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
good emotional research.

689
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He will do things very carefully.

690
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
First of all,

691
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
although you can produce a group of

692
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
grateful groups,

693
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
for example,

694
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
when you give them some benefits

695
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
when the recipient comes,

696
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
for example,

697
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
give him some money,

698
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
let him feel more grateful,

699
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
then you ask him,

700
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
he will feel good,

701
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
someone gave me money,

702
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I am very happy,

703
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
it feels like one group is more grateful,

704
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
the other group is more ungrateful,

705
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
but at the same time,

706
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
the money is not only grateful,

707
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
there must be some kind of luck,

708
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
or today the sun came out from the west,

709
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and there are some

710
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
feelings of surprise,

711
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but these feelings are not

712
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
grateful,

713
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but other emotions.

714
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So this research team

715
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
at the same time

716
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
created several

717
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
different experimental scenarios

718
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
to distinguish these different emotions,

719
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the most important of which

720
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
is to feel very lucky

721
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and feel very grateful.

722
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The method is like this,

723
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
he first invites the recipient

724
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
to collaborate with the experimenter,

725
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
he tells the recipient that the

726
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
experimenter is another recipient,

727
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
but he is actually a collateral,

728
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
he plays a small game with the

729
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
experimenter,

730
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and in the process,

731
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
the experimenter and the collateral

732
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
can work together to achieve the goal,

733
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
or they can compete with each other

734
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and see who gets more points.

735
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Then,

736
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
in one scenario,

737
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
he makes the collateral compete with the recipient,

738
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
so the collateral becomes

739
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
a jerk,

740
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
so everyone hates him,

741
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
this is the most basic baseline.

742
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
In another scenario,

743
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the experimenter lets the collateral

744
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
cooperate with the recipient,

745
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
so the collateral becomes a good person,

746
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but at the same time,

747
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
he also distinguishes two situations,

748
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
he tells the recipient that

749
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
whether the collateral wants to

750
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
cooperate with him or not,

751
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
he decides,

752
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
so if he cooperates today,

753
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
he is really a good person,

754
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
he intentionally wants to be good to you,

755
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
if he doesn't cooperate,

756
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
he is a bad person.

757
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But in another situation,

758
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
he doesn't have much control,

759
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
he just randomly instructs the recipient

760
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
whether he wants to cooperate with him or not,

761
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
so even if he cooperates with you today,

762
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
his potential regret is that

763
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
if he cooperates with you,

764
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it's not his credit,

765
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
it's just the order he received.

766
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So,

767
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
here they have three groups,

768
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the first group is the baseline,

769
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
which is a jerk,

770
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you hate your collateral,

771
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
he doesn't cooperate with you,

772
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
you hate him.

773
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
If he cooperates with you,

774
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
you will feel grateful,

775
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
but if he happens to be instructed

776
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
to do good to you,

777
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
you will only feel lucky,

778
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
you will not feel grateful.

779
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Then they continue to do this,

780
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
they tell the recipient that

781
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
this time is over,

782
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
we will go to the second stage,

783
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it has nothing to do with the first stage,

784
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
but you and the collateral

785
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
are going to have a dialogue discussion,

786
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
then he is going to see

787
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
if the recipient is going to imitate

788
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the action of this collateral,

789
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and then he found that the lucky group

790
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
actually did not imitate the phenomenon,

791
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
only the grateful group has,

792
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
it shows that it is not as long as we are happy,

793
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
any positive emotion

794
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
will produce bonding,

795
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
social bonding behavior,

796
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
there will only be grateful,

797
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
at least luck will not have.

798
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Then,

799
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
how do we measure this

800
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
imitation?

801
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
He asked

802
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
this

803
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
collateral

804
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to touch his hair

805
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
if he had nothing to do,

806
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and then count

807
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the number of times

808
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
you touched your hair

809
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
during the second stage of the dialogue.

810
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
There is a

811
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
configuration here,

812
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
there are viewers who want to provide

813
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that the experiment you are talking about

814
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
has been verified on the operation,

815
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is there a check of manipulation?

816
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yes,

817
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
they just asked,

818
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
they later asked

819
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
at the end of the experiment,

820
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
because sometimes the check of manipulation

821
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
will not be in the middle of the test,

822
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
they will say at the end

823
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
what do you feel about this person,

824
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
what kind of emotions do you have,

825
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and then there are about 20 emotions

826
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
to ask them to evaluate,

827
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and then it is true that the grateful group

828
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
is grateful, the lucky group is lucky,

829
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and then the baseline group

830
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
is the baseline,

831
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
so there is,

832
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
thank you,

833
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and then he went to

834
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
count the number of times

835
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
he touched his hair,

836
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and then it is true that he

837
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
touched his hair more than once,

838
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
but there is a confounding,

839
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
there is another possible

840
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
explanation,

841
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
he just feels grateful,

842
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
he just can't sit still,

843
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
he likes to move around,

844
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
so he just touched his hair more than once,

845
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
this may not have anything to do with

846
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
specifically imitating the other person's behavior,

847
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
do you understand what this means?

848
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
As long as I become very active,

849
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and then touch my heart,

850
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I will touch my hair more than once,

851
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
but it doesn't matter if the other person

852
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
is touching his hair,

853
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
how do you know that it is because

854
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the other person is only touching his hair,

855
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
maybe it's just right,

856
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
so they used several different actions

857
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
, one group is touching his hair,

858
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
the other group is touching his nose,

859
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and then one is touching his ears,

860
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
so what we want to see is

861
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
if today is going

862
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
this hyperactivation,

863
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that is, this kind of

864
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
explanation that can't sit still,

865
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
then he just has to

866
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
touch his ears, touch his nose,

867
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
touch his eyes,

868
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
all of them have to go up together,

869
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
there is no variability,

870
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
but if it is an imitation behavior,

871
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
then there is also a variability,

872
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
that is, there is also a variability,

873
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
so much talk,

874
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I found that I talk about this research,

875
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
how to the next page,

876
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
so much talk,

877
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
in fact, the conclusion is that

878
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I just said,

879
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
gratefulness will be produced

880
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
through behavioral imitation,

881
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
this bonding effect,

882
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
this is a possibility,

883
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that talk so much,

884
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in fact, just want to demo,

885
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
then put it in a variety of ways

886
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
to control time,

887
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
finally to talk about

888
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
our own research,

889
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
we can pause

890
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
it,

891
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
because now just to a section,

892
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
then there are

893
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
viewers want to ask questions,

894
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I directly open the microphone to ask him,

895
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
please,

896
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
you say,

897
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
he may just become very active,

898
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I keep moving,

899
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
but you can not put him

900
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the number of times,

901
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
normalize by the total movement,

902
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
that is to say,

903
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
he changed his hair

904
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
in all of his actions,

905
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
the proportion of the amount,

906
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that does not matter,

907
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
he becomes very active,

908
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
this thing,

909
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
then you can not put him

910
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
the number of times,

911
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
then he becomes very active,

912
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
this thing,

913
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
this is actually a good practice,

914
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
it is also a practice that we often do,

915
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but indeed this research,

916
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
not this research,

917
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
is the same team

918
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
of the last publication,

919
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
he did this way,

920
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
but the next one,

921
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
they tried to use the experimental way

922
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
to do the effect directly,

923
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
not just to control it in a statistical way,

924
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
that is,

925
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
in theory it is feasible,

926
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
but if you can do it,

927
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
that is, I am very powerful,

928
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I can do it,

929
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
so more of that,

930
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
when you see his experimental design,

931
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
wow, this is so smart,

932
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
but you are right,

933
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
indeed a lot of people do this.

934
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Hi,

935
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
my name is Steffie,

936
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I am a PhD student at Nanjia University,

937
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
but I do not have a background in psychology,

938
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but what I want to ask is,

939
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you said gratitude,

940
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
this emotion,

941
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
this emotion,

942
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and gratitude expression,

943
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I think they may have a little different definition,

944
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
do these two have,

945
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
that is, there is research

946
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
that shows that they have a proportional relationship,

947
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
or is it possible that someone has this emotion,

948
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
but actually does not express it,

949
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
then it may be more like the definition part,

950
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
because I have read some

951
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
articles related to emotion,

952
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and their definitions may be

953
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
different,

954
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
some people are more focused on

955
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
physical reactions,

956
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
or in the mind,

957
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
psychological feelings,

958
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I do not know what you think of this,

959
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and what you think the definition is.

960
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
OK,

961
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
let's talk about the simple one first,

962
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
or let's say the most difficult one,

963
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
this is the most difficult one,

964
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
because this is the most difficult one,

965
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
because this is the most difficult one,

966
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
or let's say the most difficult one,

967
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the most difficult one is how to define the emotion,

968
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
then how do I define it,

969
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I think only the subjective feeling,

970
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I personally, I personally,

971
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I believe that many people do not say this,

972
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I personally feel that the emotion is the subjective feeling,

973
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I feel very grateful today,

974
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
that thing is called grateful emotion,

975
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I feel very angry today,

976
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
then

977
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that subjective feeling,

978
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I call it emotion,

979
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the rest,

980
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
you can say, for example,

981
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
how do I express my anger,

982
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
that is called grateful expression,

983
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
how do I understand

984
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the context of my anger,

985
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
or the context of gratitude,

986
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that is my perception,

987
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
part of the emotional perception,

988
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
but I will not put all these things

989
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
are called grateful,

990
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
are called grateful,

991
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
are called grateful emotion,

992
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
because in fact there is no meaning,

993
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and this is not the same as the general common people

994
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
is that there is a gap,

995
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
you have to define that word,

996
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I do not care,

997
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
but this definition is very strange,

998
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
so I would say

999
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
only the emotional part is,

1000
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
so this also,

1001
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
in a way, I guess I also answer your

1002
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
other question,

1003
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
is grateful emotion and grateful expression,

1004
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
why is it different,

1005
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
grateful expression is focused on discussing

1006
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
his physical actions,

1007
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
but the emotional part is my subjective feeling,

1008
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
okay,

1009
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that two things are not related to it,

1010
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I can,

1011
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the data shows that

1012
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
my subjective report,

1013
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
how grateful I feel,

1014
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
this subjective report

1015
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
with my grateful expression of behavior

1016
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
is really related,

1017
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
this is probably not very surprising,

1018
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and is highly relevant,

1019
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
this is certainly not surprising,

1020
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
but I think everyone may not be very surprised,

1021
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
that is, this is definitely not related to

1022
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
someone is fake,

1023
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
in fact, you do not feel,

1024
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
but you must

1025
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
elders

1026
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
give us some

1027
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
gifts that we do not like,

1028
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
we have to say thank you to the scalp,

1029
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
this kind of thing we also have experience,

1030
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
this kind of thing also exists,

1031
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
it also explains why it is not related,

1032
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
on the contrary, there are many times

1033
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
grateful expression of the situation,

1034
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
such as strangers do something to you,

1035
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
then you feel very grateful,

1036
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
for example, you do not even meet strangers,

1037
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
for example,

1038
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
he silently put this

1039
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
community hall

1040
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
very clean,

1041
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but you do not meet this person,

1042
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
then how to express to whom,

1043
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
so this situation is also there,

1044
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
so there is no emotional expression,

1045
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
so to answer your other question,

1046
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
these two things will not be highly related,

1047
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
whether it is related,

1048
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
whether it can be divided,

1049
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
so it is like this,

1050
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
did I miss any questions?

1051
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
No,

1052
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I do not think so,

1053
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I just want to say,

1054
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I know they define different,

1055
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I also understand those points,

1056
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I do not know if there is a overlapping part,

1057
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
what is the overlapping part,

1058
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
you are now a bit of it,

1059
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
emotion is a subjective feeling,

1060
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
so that person himself

1061
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
knows if he has this emotion,

1062
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
then the expression

1063
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
may be external,

1064
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you can observe

1065
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
behavior,

1066
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
so the two are completely

1067
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
completely separate two things,

1068
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in your mind,

1069
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I prefer to be like this,

1070
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I just look at it now,

1071
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
that is to say, Mark said that emotion

1072
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
is a system,

1073
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I know a lot of people have this

1074
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
angle, but I do not

1075
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
say that emotion is a system,

1076
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I would say that there is a system of

1077
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
emotion around

1078
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
gratitude,

1079
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I want to say that gratitude is a good emotion,

1080
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
there is an expression next to it, there is an observation next to it,

1081
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
there are cognitive components next to it,

1082
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
there are context components,

1083
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
there are even cultural components,

1084
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
it has a system,

1085
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
this is what I can agree with,

1086
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
but emotion is a system,

1087
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I want to say this,

1088
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
many people say this,

1089
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
you walk on the road,

1090
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
see how people use the word emotion,

1091
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
no one uses it like this,

1092
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
if you don't use it like this,

1093
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
you have to define it like this,

1094
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I think it's a bit deliberate,

1095
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and

1096
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
it's not necessarily helpful,

1097
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I think,

1098
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
this is my own comment,

1099
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but I'm sure a lot of people

1100
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
outside will say that emotion is a

1101
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
system,

1102
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I think it's a bit different.

1103
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yes, I probably understand that angle,

1104
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I have seen some related

1105
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
articles before,

1106
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
some people will argue that

1107
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
sometimes emotions

1108
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
appear subconsciously,

1109
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and sometimes they follow subjective feelings,

1110
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I have seen this kind of statement,

1111
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
so I want to ask

1112
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
what the people in the background really think, thank you.

1113
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But I can't

1114
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
represent everyone

1115
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to talk about this matter,

1116
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
but I personally

1117
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
always feel that the field of

1118
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
emotional research is independent

1119
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
or has relative independence,

1120
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
because it has feelings,

1121
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and it has very strong subjective feelings,

1122
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
this is why we call it emotional,

1123
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
if you say there is an emotion,

1124
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
he can't feel it,

1125
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
then we say that it is a different

1126
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
psychological state,

1127
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
no normal person would call it emotion,

1128
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
it's weird,

1129
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't know what I mean,

1130
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
so next I want to tell you

1131
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
this research,

1132
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
this is a more

1133
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
exploratory research,

1134
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
we want to

1135
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
ask a question,

1136
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
thank you,

1137
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
indeed,

1138
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
my partner and I,

1139
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
both can promote interpersonal relations,

1140
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
past research has also found,

1141
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
past research has also found some

1142
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
physical mechanism,

1143
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
or

1144
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
behavioral mechanism,

1145
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but these components

1146
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
between

1147
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
independence

1148
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
how about it,

1149
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
how much overlap between them,

1150
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
so we have to ask this question,

1151
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
in this research,

1152
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
we found more than 200 couples,

1153
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I think it's

1154
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
400 to 500 people,

1155
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
we both

1156
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
came early,

1157
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
then ask them to

1158
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
record every day,

1159
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
did the other person

1160
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
say thank you to me today,

1161
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
pay attention to this behavior,

1162
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
did you say thank you to me,

1163
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
did I receive the other person's

1164
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
gratitude, both

1165
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
people hit, so you can see

1166
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
received by me

1167
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and received by my partner,

1168
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
then there is express,

1169
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
it seems to be gone,

1170
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
it's gone,

1171
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
but I can't see the video,

1172
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
wait a minute,

1173
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
OK,

1174
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
this is a slide,

1175
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
so

1176
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
in the 14-day process,

1177
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
we ask both people

1178
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to record every day,

1179
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
did you express your gratitude to me,

1180
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
did you say thank you to me,

1181
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
at the same time,

1182
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
did you say thank you to your partner,

1183
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
you can imagine,

1184
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I thank my partner,

1185
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I say thank you to my partner,

1186
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
it's a pair,

1187
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
it's just the same event,

1188
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
then from two different angles,

1189
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
two different people's

1190
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
perspective,

1191
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
so these four measurements

1192
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
can be paired like this,

1193
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
from me to my partner,

1194
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and vice versa,

1195
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
my partner can also flow back like this,

1196
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
so it's two pairs,

1197
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
then we take these four

1198
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
events

1199
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
to predict every day,

1200
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
we also ask the receiver

1201
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
to answer every day,

1202
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
how satisfied are you with

1203
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
your relationship with you today,

1204
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and then there is,

1205
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
yes, that's it,

1206
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
and then we can calculate

1207
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
ups and downs,

1208
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
like the design of the experiment,

1209
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
then we use these four events

1210
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
at the same time to predict

1211
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
every day,

1212
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
ups and downs,

1213
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
the result can be seen,

1214
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
that is,

1215
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the same one,

1216
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
let's say it's a gratitude episode,

1217
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I thank you,

1218
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
then you are thanked,

1219
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the same episode,

1220
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
you say I thank you,

1221
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I say I thank you,

1222
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
from the perspective of two different people,

1223
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
then we found that

1224
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
this is what I say,

1225
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
now the green one is what I say,

1226
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
you thank me,

1227
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
then I say I thank you,

1228
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
then this is what you say,

1229
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I thank you,

1230
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
then this is what you say,

1231
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
you thank me,

1232
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
we found that these four

1233
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
are enough for my

1234
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
prediction effect,

1235
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and it is an independent

1236
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
prediction effect,

1237
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
what does this mean?

1238
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yes, I will feel better,

1239
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
my relationship will be better,

1240
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
what does this mean?

1241
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Let's talk about these two green ones first,

1242
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
these two are more intuitive,

1243
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
these two are

1244
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
if you thank me, I will feel happier,

1245
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
this is a bit of nonsense,

1246
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
you thank me, I feel happier,

1247
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
this is very intuitive,

1248
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
if you thank me, I will feel happier,

1249
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
this is very intuitive,

1250
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
because there should be something good happened,

1251
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I have to thank you,

1252
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
so I should be happier today,

1253
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
but we found that

1254
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
this green one

1255
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
means

1256
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
you thank me,

1257
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
you say you thank me,

1258
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I will be happier,

1259
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and this thing is independent of

1260
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
whether I say you thank me,

1261
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
although I say no,

1262
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I did not notice,

1263
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
do you thank me?

1264
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Although my reaction today is like this,

1265
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
this invisible thank you

1266
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
will still reflect

1267
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
my satisfaction with my relationship today,

1268
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
do you understand?

1269
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
This is invisible,

1270
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
because this thing is independent,

1271
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
our research has made it independent,

1272
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I say you thank me,

1273
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
although I say no,

1274
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
the part you say will still reflect

1275
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
my satisfaction with my relationship,

1276
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the more strange thing is that

1277
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the audience asked

1278
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
how to record

1279
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
or measure

1280
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
the so-called thanks

1281
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
, how to do

1282
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
the more objective part

1283
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
?

1284
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
We use binary measurement,

1285
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
so yes or no,

1286
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
do you thank others?

1287
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yes or no,

1288
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
we let both of them answer,

1289
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
so we can stack their data

1290
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
from left to right,

1291
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
it is a binary measurement,

1292
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
this is more strange,

1293
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
you say I thank you,

1294
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
although I say no,

1295
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I do not remember,

1296
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
this is strange,

1297
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
because it is independent of my expression,

1298
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
at the same time I will feel happier,

1299
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
although you say I thank you,

1300
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
but I say I do not remember,

1301
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I will feel happier,

1302
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
we have an explanation for this thing,

1303
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
because everyone can see

1304
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
this relationship,

1305
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
we draw it like this,

1306
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
let it become a loop,

1307
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
you think I thank you,

1308
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
then you will express to me,

1309
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
then you will do something

1310
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
to make you a better partner,

1311
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
so it will become,

1312
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I will get a better partner,

1313
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I will feel happier,

1314
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
this is a long shot,

1315
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
this is an explanation,

1316
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
we have not tested yet,

1317
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but this is a possible explanation.

1318
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
At the same time,

1319
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I finished this chapter to ask you a question,

1320
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
at the same time,

1321
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
we also measured

1322
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
the relationship between

1323
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
these beneficiaries

1324
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
,

1325
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the degree of satisfaction

1326
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
for their own lives,

1327
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
not for this relationship,

1328
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
but for the overall life,

1329
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
there is the same effect,

1330
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and this effect is completely

1331
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
terminated by relationship satisfaction,

1332
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
here I want to stop

1333
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and ask you a question,

1334
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
we have a question

1335
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
here,

1336
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
he wants to ask about the binary part,

1337
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
then ask Felix directly,

1338
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
is Felix there?

1339
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Hello,

1340
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I am Felix,

1341
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
the question I want to ask

1342
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
is related to the binary part,

1343
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
because now the senior

1344
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
is asking

1345
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
if they feel it,

1346
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
my question is

1347
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
how many times a day

1348
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
do you throw it out

1349
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and ask him

1350
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
if he feels it?

1351
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Or ask him after the day

1352
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
to recall how many times he received

1353
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and how many times he thanked?

1354
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This is a good question,

1355
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
we only ask once a day,

1356
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
before going to bed,

1357
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
did this happen all day?

1358
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Okay, thank you.

1359
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Hello,

1360
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I have another question,

1361
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
where is this done?

1362
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
What is the background of the object?

1363
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
These people

1364
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
are in

1365
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Beka

1366
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Triangle

1367
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
,

1368
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
so the object

1369
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
is the person living there,

1370
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
who is it?

1371
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Anyone over the age of 18,

1372
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
basically anyone over the age of 18,

1373
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
if I remember correctly,

1374
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
the youngest couple,

1375
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the youngest victim

1376
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
is 18 years old,

1377
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
our low standard,

1378
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
we ask them to be 18 years old,

1379
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
the oldest is

1380
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
67 years old,

1381
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
if I remember correctly.

1382
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
OK, thank you.

1383
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I think this should be

1384
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
supplemented,

1385
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
you can imagine,

1386
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
if our age range is so large,

1387
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
their relationship should be very large,

1388
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
just started dating for a month,

1389
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
married for 20-30 years,

1390
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
so this range is

1391
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
a nice range.

1392
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Is there any question from the audience?

1393
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
If not,

1394
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I have a question myself,

1395
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I would like to ask the senior

1396
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
in this study,

1397
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
do you have any control,

1398
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
which is the main

1399
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
confounding?

1400
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yes,

1401
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
this is also a very good question,

1402
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
we ask him every night,

1403
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
do you thank people,

1404
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
have you been thanked,

1405
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
we actually asked a bunch of

1406
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
different things,

1407
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
some of them are more important,

1408
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
in the past, it was also found that

1409
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
the satisfaction of the relationship

1410
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
is a very important prediction,

1411
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
including whether the other party

1412
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
has done half of the plus,

1413
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
we are not asking this,

1414
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
we are asking if there is

1415
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
a fair amount of plus or something,

1416
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
anyway, it is a similar wording,

1417
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
fairness, reciprocity,

1418
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
this is very important,

1419
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
this is basically

1420
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
the most important component of

1421
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
subjectivity is difficult to say,

1422
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
but subjectivity and reciprocity are very important,

1423
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
we have control of this,

1424
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
the result is the same,

1425
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
we also have control of

1426
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
whether the other party is very polite,

1427
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
how do we say

1428
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
courteous,

1429
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
we have control of this,

1430
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
so gratitude is not

1431
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
purely fair,

1432
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
gratitude is not purely

1433
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
polite,

1434
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
we also control self-disclosure,

1435
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
did the other party tell you something,

1436
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
did you tell him something,

1437
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
so it's not like this,

1438
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
because it's not necessarily a matter of gratitude,

1439
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
sometimes it's just a boss,

1440
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
but in the past,

1441
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
it was found that it was quite effective

1442
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
to do it together,

1443
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
so we have to control this,

1444
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and then we also control

1445
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
whether the other party

1446
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
performed very positively today,

1447
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
in general,

1448
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
are you a happy person,

1449
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
control is purely positive,

1450
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it seems that any positive

1451
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
mood is possible,

1452
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
we control it,

1453
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
so it doesn't matter,

1454
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
so gratitude is not just happy.

1455
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Thank you, the audience here has a question,

1456
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Felix, please ask,

1457
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
hello, I'm Felix,

1458
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I just asked a question,

1459
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
then I want to ask one more question

1460
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
for the one just now,

1461
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
the mayor is now the last day,

1462
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
the last day to ask him if he is grateful

1463
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
or grateful,

1464
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
so I want to ask,

1465
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
so there is no measurement of the number of gratefulness?

1466
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
No,

1467
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
OK,

1468
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
thank you,

1469
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
this is a very good question,

1470
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
because in experience sampling,

1471
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
because our approach is

1472
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
more like experience sampling,

1473
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
that is to say,

1474
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
continuously and then constantly

1475
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
for the audience who do not know this method,

1476
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I think Felix may know,

1477
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
for the audience who do not know this,

1478
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
experience sampling

1479
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
at what time to measure,

1480
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
then how densely measured the frequency,

1481
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
this is very important,

1482
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
because you will catch

1483
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
different research questions,

1484
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
this thing,

1485
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I wait a minute,

1486
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I can think about it now,

1487
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I didn't talk about it now,

1488
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'll talk about it later,

1489
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
for me, everyone will know

1490
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
how to catch different research questions,

1491
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
especially different

1492
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
temporal scope research questions,

1493
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
do we still have time?

1494
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That is now

1495
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
about to go,

1496
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
it's almost 9.30,

1497
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
see if there is any time

1498
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
on the senior side

1499
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
to arrange or think about it.

1500
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
OK, I will finish this time in 5 minutes,

1501
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
then we will finish, OK?

1502
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
OK.

1503
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
The next research

1504
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
is very similar

1505
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
to the previous research conclusion,

1506
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
we just want to make the effect of gratitude

1507
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
into an experiment,

1508
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
not just observation,

1509
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
in addition, we use

1510
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
not only subjective

1511
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
subjective assessment of

1512
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
relationship satisfaction,

1513
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
we use a more objective assessment,

1514
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
that is, how much time

1515
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
do you spend with your partner

1516
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
? Why do we choose this

1517
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
objective assessment?

1518
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
For this

1519
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
animal research,

1520
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
more experienced friends

1521
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
should know,

1522
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
we are studying this

1523
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
mouse, when the mousetrap

1524
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
this

1525
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
two mice together,

1526
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
stay together for how long?

1527
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That is, we measure whether they have bonding,

1528
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
so

1529
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
the strength of their bonding strength,

1530
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
human bonding strength,

1531
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
to a certain extent,

1532
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
can be measured in this way,

1533
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
and this can help us pull our research to

1534
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
animal research,

1535
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
then this is a second

1536
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
is that we use the experiment

1537
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
so this experiment

1538
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
is the way to measure

1539
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
the first two weeks,

1540
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
the first 14 days,

1541
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
we asked them to go home

1542
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and do the same as just

1543
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
this report,

1544
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
this report is how much time

1545
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you spend with your partner,

1546
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
how much time you spend today,

1547
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
no matter what you do,

1548
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
anyway,

1549
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and then go to the lab

1550
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
to do the experiment,

1551
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
there are two groups,

1552
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
one group is that we

1553
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
remind him to go home

1554
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and remember to thank him,

1555
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
remember to say thank you,

1556
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
another group is that we

1557
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
give him a little nudge

1558
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'll talk about later,

1559
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
but then put them home,

1560
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
then they record four weeks,

1561
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
28 days,

1562
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
every day you spend with your partner

1563
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
how much time together,

1564
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
then we want to see

1565
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
these two groups

1566
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
after receiving the experiment

1567
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
from the front to the back,

1568
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
there is a group that has increased,

1569
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
a group that has not increased,

1570
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
or increased not so much,

1571
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
how do we do it?

1572
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We told him that this gratitude is great,

1573
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
go back and remember to say thank you,

1574
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
this is the first control group,

1575
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
the experiment group is grateful,

1576
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
then you have to remember to say thank you,

1577
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
in order for you to achieve this goal,

1578
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
we ask you to help you do a

1579
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
gratitude plan,

1580
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
but this plan is to fill in the

1581
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
following blank,

1582
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
when if anything happens,

1583
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
then you write

1584
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
how you want to express gratitude,

1585
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I'll give you an example,

1586
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
for example,

1587
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
when he helped me buy breakfast in the morning,

1588
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
then I want to give him a

1589
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
kiss to express my gratitude,

1590
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I wrote it like this,

1591
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
this plan is done,

1592
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
then we look at this

1593
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
one-line plan,

1594
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
four weeks after going home,

1595
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
is there a four-week effect?

1596
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It sounds quite incredible,

1597
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
for some people,

1598
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
it may sound a bit incredible,

1599
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
it's like writing a fill-in-the-blank,

1600
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and you have to influence how long

1601
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
they spend together a day,

1602
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
they don't spend time together,

1603
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
just follow the plan,

1604
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
how much can it affect,

1605
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I'll give you an example,

1606
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
this method of manipulation

1607
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
is called Implementation Intention,

1608
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
in the document,

1609
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
it is found to be a very simple

1610
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
but very surprising effective

1611
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
way to change behavior,

1612
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
for example,

1613
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in this study,

1614
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
we divided the subject into two groups,

1615
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
one group gave them

1616
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
a reminder,

1617
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
it is very important to check the

1618
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
uterus,

1619
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
their subject is a 55-year-old

1620
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
or a few years older woman,

1621
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
British,

1622
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
remind them that the uterus is very important,

1623
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
then you have to participate in the

1624
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
test,

1625
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
if you want to make an appointment,

1626
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
there is a phone number below,

1627
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
remind him,

1628
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
then you have to make a plan,

1629
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
for example,

1630
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
someone will write,

1631
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
if it is lunch time,

1632
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
then I have to call my doctor,

1633
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
then make an appointment,

1634
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
please help them

1635
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
have an appointment

1636
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
plan,

1637
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
we are exactly the same,

1638
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
the result found

1639
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
reminder group,

1640
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
then participate in

1641
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
the appointment,

1642
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
then participate in the appointment,

1643
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
did not miss their

1644
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
appointment ratio,

1645
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
about 70%, 69%

1646
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
on the left,

1647
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
but only this one-line plan,

1648
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
you can add the

1649
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
attendance rate

1650
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
to almost 100,

1651
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
in fact, 92,

1652
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
but this one-line plan

1653
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
is very effective,

1654
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
you can try in life,

1655
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I have tried very effective,

1656
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
it does not matter to us now,

1657
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
the point is that it is effective,

1658
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it is also effective in our experiment,

1659
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
one-line plan effectively

1660
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
improved the group of

1661
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
participants in the

1662
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
experiment after the

1663
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
ratio of gratitude,

1664
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
but this is a manipulation check,

1665
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
because we want to know

1666
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
whether the time together

1667
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
has not changed,

1668
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
of course, you can imagine

1669
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
that there is,

1670
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
of course, it is from the front to the back,

1671
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
the experiment group increased

1672
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
every day,

1673
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
the average amount of time

1674
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
together every day,

1675
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
then the unit is a minute,

1676
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
so it is nearly 80 minutes,

1677
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
an hour and 20 minutes,

1678
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
then the gray is the error bar,

1679
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
then the red is the

1680
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
control group,

1681
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
then the control group is basically

1682
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
the front to the back,

1683
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
there is no change,

1684
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
there is no change in their time together,

1685
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
this is not surprising,

1686
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
but one-line plan

1687
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
can increase

1688
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
the average time of

1689
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
physical presence

1690
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
every day for 80 minutes,

1691
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
then you can see

1692
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
below,

1693
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
of course,

1694
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
we have to break down

1695
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
and see what you are doing

1696
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
together,

1697
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
then across the board,

1698
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
for example,

1699
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
they sleep together,

1700
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
then together,

1701
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
then share the project,

1702
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
they are together and do

1703
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the same thing,

1704
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
they are cooperating on some things,

1705
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
separate project,

1706
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
they are in the same room,

1707
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
with each other's physical presence,

1708
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
but

1709
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
they are doing their own thing,

1710
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
for example, you two

1711
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
work from home together,

1712
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
they are in the same room,

1713
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
across the board,

1714
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
the gratitude group has a noticeable effect.

1715
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Finally,

1716
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
we have measured

1717
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
a remote communication,

1718
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that is, how much time

1719
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
do you spend with your partner?

1720
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Remote communication,

1721
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
what does it mean?

1722
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
This is to compare

1723
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
that they may spend more time together,

1724
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
but there is no physical presence,

1725
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
they spend time together,

1726
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
but there is no physical presence.

1727
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Indeed,

1728
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
in this aspect,

1729
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
the gratitude group

1730
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
not only does not increase,

1731
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
but also significantly decreases.

1732
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
In other words,

1733
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
gratitude has a kind of

1734
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
desire for our audience,

1735
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
again, this is a triangle,

1736
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
this is an American,

1737
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
they will have a physical

1738
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
contact.

1739
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Let's go back to the mouse.

1740
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
This is very important.

1741
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
For this

1742
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
biological research,

1743
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
it is more experienced,

1744
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
you may know,

1745
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
physical contact,

1746
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
for example, we touch

1747
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
our partner,

1748
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
or our partner touches

1749
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
our body,

1750
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
it will produce a series of

1751
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
physiological chemical

1752
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
cascade.

1753
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
One of them

1754
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
is a neurotransmitter

1755
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
called oxytocin.

1756
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
What is it?

1757
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Oxytocin,

1758
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
in Chinese,

1759
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
oxytocin.

1760
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
This oxytocin

1761
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
is found in the mouse,

1762
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
it is actually difficult to predict

1763
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
bonding.

1764
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Let's look at this mouse.

1765
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
These two mice are

1766
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
pre-reborn,

1767
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
their characteristics are that

1768
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
after mating,

1769
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
they will stay together

1770
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
and form an exclusive

1771
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
monogamous bond.

1772
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
They are not

1773
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
so similar to humans,

1774
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
humans are not so monogamous,

1775
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
but you know what I'm talking about.

1776
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But the relatives of primary

1777
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
volts, middle volts,

1778
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
are not like this,

1779
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
they do not have

1780
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
exclusive bonds,

1781
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
they are

1782
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
mating, then you can change partners,

1783
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
mating, then you can change partners,

1784
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
but their genes are very similar,

1785
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
but at least

1786
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
the social bonding

1787
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
is very different.

1788
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Then the study found that

1789
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
oxytocin plays a very important

1790
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
role in this.

1791
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Indeed,

1792
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
by manipulating the primary volts

1793
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
and the middle volts

1794
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
oxytocin receptor,

1795
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
we can make these mice

1796
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
operate from

1797
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
exclusive bonds

1798
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
into open relationships.

1799
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We can also make open relationships

1800
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
into exclusive.

1801
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Indeed,

1802
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
because of this reason,

1803
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
we collected the urine of

1804
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
these mammals

1805
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
to measure

1806
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
their oxytocin

1807
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
amount.

1808
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
We have this marker inside.

1809
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Now back to the previous point,

1810
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
why

1811
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
the daily report method,

1812
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
if you are in one day,

1813
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
randomly find a time to BIP your

1814
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
victim, or you are

1815
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
the last time to sleep

1816
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
to a summary,

1817
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
there is a difference,

1818
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
because we can imagine

1819
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
if we do today is

1820
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
a general biological experiment,

1821
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
many times we will say,

1822
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
no, the most accurate draw at the scene,

1823
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
so you have to know how high

1824
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
now you have to draw now,

1825
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
so if you draw out, you will be very

1826
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
accurate to know

1827
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
the degree of oxytocin now,

1828
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
then you can ask

1829
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
the degree of oxytocin now affects

1830
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
the human behavior

1831
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
in this moment.

1832
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
But we all know,

1833
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I feel oxytocin now,

1834
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
then I have bonding,

1835
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I may not have the opportunity to express gratitude,

1836
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I may have to spend

1837
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
you do not know if I am now

1838
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
you thank me, my oxytocin is about to rush up,

1839
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
or two hours later

1840
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
rush up to make me

1841
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
express my gratitude to you at night?

1842
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I do not know, because the time was pulled

1843
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
very long,

1844
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
so once you study the problem,

1845
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
this temporal scope becomes larger,

1846
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
you may need to measure the way a little change,

1847
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
such as we use urine, because you do not

1848
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
urine inside the oxytocin marker

1849
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
is basically

1850
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
considered to be a certain extent

1851
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
or a long period of time

1852
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
oxytocin level average,

1853
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
because the urine

1854
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
to hold for a while in the temporal scope,

1855
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
so you high, high, low,

1856
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
then after the average, the amount of marker will stay in your

1857
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
urine, so it is a relatively long-term average,

1858
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
with us in front of the

1859
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
daily report is similar,

1860
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
so when we ask the question now,

1861
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
if you spend how much time today,

1862
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
we may be this kind of measurement

1863
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
is more

1864
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
fit measurement.

1865
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I'm done, I'm done.

1866
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
If this is the case,

1867
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
we are starting at 8.33 today,

1868
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I think we

1869
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
can now open to everyone

1870
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
to discuss about

1871
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
9.50,

1872
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
if anyone has a question.

1873
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
In addition to the audience

1874
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
today is the content of the speech

1875
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
if there is a question, if the speaker

1876
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
past research or

1877
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
so on, you can ask

1878
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
questions.

1879
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
If you want to ask a question, you can speak directly.

1880
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I am Felix.

1881
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I have a question about oxytocin.

1882
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Because I saw a document a while ago

1883
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
that said oxytocin

1884
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
seemed to think in the past

1885
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
that it can predict a relationship

1886
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
directly,

1887
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
but that

1888
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
study revealed some documents

1889
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and found that, for example,

1890
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
in mice, some oxytocin is very

1891
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
high, it even has some aggressive behavior,

1892
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and then in humans,

1893
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
it seems to be the attachment

1894
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
that affects the

1895
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
effect of oxytocin.

1896
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I don't know if you have any

1897
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
opinions on this.

1898
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Have you found that people with high oxytocin

1899
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
don't necessarily spend

1900
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
more time on this?

1901
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Let's talk about our research first.

1902
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I haven't analyzed the oxytocin data yet,

1903
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
so I don't know.

1904
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
This is a quick answer.

1905
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
In our lab, another study

1906
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
found that oxytocin level

1907
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
has to interact with social

1908
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
contacts to have better

1909
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
predictability.

1910
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
We found that

1911
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
if your partner is grateful to you,

1912
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
but your

1913
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
expression basically

1914
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
sucks,

1915
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
then your oxytocin level is useless.

1916
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
If you are not a good

1917
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
partner, what are you playing?

1918
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You are playing something, you know,

1919
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
nothing. So there is an

1920
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
interaction. Your partner

1921
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
is a good partner, and your oxytocin

1922
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
is higher, and their bonding

1923
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
will be stronger.

1924
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Back to what you just said,

1925
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I totally agree with

1926
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
what you just said.

1927
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
For those of you who don't know

1928
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
the oxytocin literature

1929
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
or the social regulation function of

1930
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
oxytocin literature, a little background.

1931
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
In this,

1932
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
a lot of news

1933
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
in the first ten years,

1934
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
oxytocin is called

1935
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
love hormone.

1936
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
As long as your oxytocin level is high,

1937
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
you are world peace.

1938
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Everyone is a good friend.

1939
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
They gave it a name

1940
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
called love hormone.

1941
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But in the past few years,

1942
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I feel like everyone is moving

1943
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
in the direction

1944
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
of what Felix just said.

1945
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
What kind of behavior

1946
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
will oxytocin cause

1947
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
has a high interaction

1948
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
effect.

1949
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Rather than a love hormone,

1950
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
it is a social hormone.

1951
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
If your oxytocin is high,

1952
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
your social sensitivity will be high.

1953
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So if you are with a good partner,

1954
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
you will have a lot of love.

1955
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But if you are with

1956
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
your enemy today,

1957
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
you will become very aggressive.

1958
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It will be more aggressive than

1959
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
it used to be, because you are now

1960
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
very socially sensitive.

1961
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Rather than a love hormone,

1962
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
it is a bonding hormone

1963
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
or a social regulation hormone.

1964
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I feel like oxytocin

1965
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
is more like this.

1966
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
My own attitude is that

1967
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
oxytocin should be like this.

1968
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
So I agree with Felix.

1969
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Thank you.

1970
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Do you have any questions

1971
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
for the audience?

1972
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Do you want to ask

1973
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
yourself?

1974
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Okay.

1975
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
There is a question

1976
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
from the audience.

1977
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
If you want to follow

1978
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
the social distancing rule,

1979
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
if you want to express

1980
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
gratitude to your family

1981
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
or partner through

1982
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
social media,

1983
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
is it useful

1984
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
for bonding?

1985
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Or do you have

1986
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
any suggestions

1987
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
for this special period?

1988
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Okay.

1989
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I don't have data,

1990
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
but I think it's useful.

1991
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I think it's useful.

1992
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
The reason is that

1993
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
you can imitate

1994
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
other people's behavior

1995
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and it will be effective.

1996
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But you don't have to

1997
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
see it face to face.

1998
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
You can still see it

1999
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
if you turn on the video.

2000
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
This is the first one.

2001
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
The second one is

2002
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
about gratitude.

2003
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
There is a similar study

2004
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
done in our next lab.

2005
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It's like this.

2006
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's like

2007
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
asking a veterinarian

2008
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
to come to the lab

2009
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and watch a funny YouTube video.

2010
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
You've probably seen it.

2011
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It's a funny YouTube video.

2012
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
At the same time,

2013
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
there is an experiment partner

2014
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
watching it with you.

2015
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
This is another veterinarian.

2016
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
At this time,

2017
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
the two people will watch the video

2018
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and laugh, right?

2019
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Because it's a funny video.

2020
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There are two manipulations.

2021
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
This is an experimental group.

2022
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
One is

2023
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
the partner

2024
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
laughing with the veterinarian

2025
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
at the time of laughing.

2026
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
The other group is laughing

2027
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
when the veterinarian is not laughing.

2028
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Then the two people

2029
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
find out that

2030
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
after laughing together,

2031
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
there will be a better bonding.

2032
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Even though

2033
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
their total laughter volume

2034
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
is not high,

2035
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
but there is a

2036
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
countermeasure.

2037
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Why am I talking about this?

2038
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Because I just talked about this.

2039
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The partner is not actually

2040
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
on the spot.

2041
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
He actually used Webcam

2042
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
to laugh.

2043
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So there is only one person in that space.

2044
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
So it's like social distancing.

2045
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
For example,

2046
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
your partner is far away.

2047
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I don't know about you, but I'm in Taiwan.

2048
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Let's say my partner is in New York.

2049
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Let's spend some time

2050
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
watching a funny video

2051
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
and laughing together.

2052
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I think it will have a good effect

2053
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
on bonding.

2054
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
The last one is

2055
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
more abstract.

2056
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But

2057
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
even if there is no video,

2058
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
there is no

2059
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
visual information.

2060
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Studies have found that

2061
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
when we hear some sounds,

2062
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
our visual cortex

2063
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
will react.

2064
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's like we're going to

2065
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
visualize what we hear.

2066
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So when you read a novel,

2067
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
sometimes it looks like

2068
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
there is a picture, right?

2069
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Talking on the phone

2070
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
and laughing together

2071
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
even if you don't see people

2072
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
will theoretically have some effect.

2073
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And anyway,

2074
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
in the process of

2075
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
self-isolation,

2076
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
there are

2077
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
interpersonal relationships,

2078
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
no matter what form, far, near,

2079
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
visual, no visual, only sound,

2080
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
or a card, text, etc.,

2081
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
far better than

2082
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
visual.

2083
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
That's my prediction.

2084
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I believe there are

2085
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
a lot of data to support it.

2086
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Our time is up.

2087
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
This is the last question.

2088
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I don't know if you have any questions.

2089
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
If not,

2090
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
let me summarize

2091
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
and ask you a question.

2092
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I've learned a lot

2093
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
from your talk today.

2094
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
As someone

2095
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
who cares about marriage,

2096
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and we're in self-isolation,

2097
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
we're stuck together

2098
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
under the same roof.

2099
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I've learned a lot

2100
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
from your talk today.

2101
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I've learned a lot

2102
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
from your talk today.

2103
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I've learned a lot

2104
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
from your talk today.

2105
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Do you have anything

2106
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
to say to people

2107
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
to help them

2108
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
implement

2109
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
self-isolation

2110
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
after the pandemic

2111
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
and recovery?

2112
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Oh, I see.

2113
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I think

2114
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
implementation and intention

2115
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
are quite fun.

2116
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
You can try to write it down

2117
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
and see what you can do

2118
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
with it.

2119
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I think if you can

2120
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
use it to help you

2121
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
pay more attention to

2122
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
the things you should be grateful for

2123
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
in your life,

2124
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
it will be very helpful.

2125
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Why am I talking about

2126
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
the things you should be grateful for

2127
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
in your life,

2128
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
instead of the things you should remember to express?

2129
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Because

2130
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
research has shown

2131
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
that it is easy to express

2132
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
something that is not sincere.

2133
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But

2134
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
when you are truly grateful,

2135
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
you may feel

2136
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
that you are not expressing yourself,

2137
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
but others can see it.

2138
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So for me,

2139
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
it's about being grateful,

2140
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
not expressing it.

2141
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Implementation and intention

2142
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
is a very effective

2143
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
method that I think

2144
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
can help you achieve this goal.

2145
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So you can write it down.

2146
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
For example,

2147
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
if he helps me buy breakfast this morning,

2148
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I will

2149
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
say thank you

2150
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
instead of

2151
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
remembering to say thank you.

2152
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I will cherish this breakfast

2153
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
that he bought for me.

2154
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But today,

2155
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
if he helps me buy breakfast every day,

2156
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I will cherish it.

2157
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Next,

2158
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
my assumption is that

2159
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I will express my gratitude

2160
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
smoothly,

2161
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
so I don't need to say it again.

2162
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
But the emotion part is quite important.

2163
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Okay, I'm done.

2164
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Okay, time control is very good

2165
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
and very practical.

2166
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Thank you Dr. Zhang Yanping for

2167
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
joining us today.

2168
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I hope that everyone

2169
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
has a wonderful and healthy day

2170
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
whether it's day or night.

2171
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Thank you for your participation today.

2172
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Thank you Dr. Zhang Yanping.

2173
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Thank you.

2174
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Okay, the recording should end here.

2175
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Okay.
