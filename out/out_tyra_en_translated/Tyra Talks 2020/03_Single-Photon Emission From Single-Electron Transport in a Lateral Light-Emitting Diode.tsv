0	3500	Welcome everyone to the Taira Talk on April 11th.
3500	9000	We are honored to have Xiao Zhigang to give us a speech.
9000	12000	Today's topic is
12000	17000	Single Photon Emission from Single Electron Transport
17000	21000	in a Soul-Driven Lateral Light Emitting Diode.
21000	29000	It seems to be related to quantum computation.
30000	36000	Our speaker today studied in Hsinchu.
36000	42000	He went to a research institute in NTU.
42000	48000	He said that his research results were mainly in thermonuclear conduction.
48000	53000	After graduating from the institute, he studied in the UK.
53000	58000	Now he is doing his PhD in QTEC at Daft University in the Netherlands.
58000	64000	Before we start, let's give our speaker a round of applause.
64000	68000	Please remember to turn on your microphones first.
76000	80000	Let's give the floor to Xiao Zhigang.
80000	86000	Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.
86000	90000	No matter where you are, I hope you are all safe.
90000	97000	What I'm going to talk about today is mainly my work as a PhD in QTEC.
97000	102000	It was published in Nature Communication in February this year.
102000	106000	The citation is here.
106000	112000	If you are interested in more details, you can refer to this paper.
112000	118000	I'm not sure about the level of the audience today.
118000	121000	Or maybe everyone's field of expertise is different.
121000	124000	So I'm not going to go very deep today.
124000	130000	I will use some more straightforward methods to express.
130000	136000	If you have any questions, you can ask directly.
136000	142000	If you have questions online, it will be more interactive.
142000	157000	Today's main work is to introduce a new or a new way to produce single-ray.
157000	165000	We use a surface wave in a structure similar to an LED to produce a single-ray.
165000	174000	Today's topic is mainly about quantum communication.
174000	181000	Quantum computing is what I am studying and researching in QTEC in the Netherlands.
181000	186000	If I have a chance later, I will share it with you.
186000	193000	Anyway, today is mainly about quantum information technology.
193000	198000	What kind of applications does quantum information technology have?
198000	202000	I believe everyone has seen the movie.
202000	210000	Quantum technology can make people shrink or travel through time and space.
210000	215000	The Avengers tells you that quantum mechanics can achieve these things.
215000	220000	But here I can tell you that these are all nonsense.
220000	225000	These things have nothing to do with quantum mechanics.
225000	233000	Anyway, now the movie is that no matter what it is, if you can't explain it, just use quantum mechanics.
233000	237000	Okay, let's get serious now.
237000	242000	So today is mainly about quantum communication.
242000	251000	The main thing that quantum communication is doing is basically written very clearly in this review paper.
251000	258000	Quantum communication is basically the technology of transferring a quantum state from one place to another.
258000	270000	In quantum information, the traditional quantum state is carried by light.
270000	277000	The so-called light is the basic example of light.
277000	285000	In quantum communication, we use light to carry a quantum state.
285000	292000	So if you can produce a single light, you can use this single light to carry a quantum state.
292000	303000	One of the applications of quantum information is the so-called quantum key distribution.
303000	313000	Basically, this protocol is a person named Alice.
313000	319000	She sends a series of light, a series of single light.
319000	327000	She encodes the quantum information into the direction of the light.
327000	339000	The receiver Bob can get the quantum state of this light.
339000	349000	Then she randomly selects and measures the direction of the light.
349000	353000	Of course, I won't talk about the details.
353000	360000	But through such a protocol, they can establish a quantum key that shares with each other.
360000	369000	After establishing this quantum key, it can be used to encrypt their information.
369000	378000	The advantage of this protocol is that if a third party tries to steal the information in the process of transmitting the quantum key,
378000	384000	they will find out that the communication channel is not safe.
384000	393000	We should stop and try different channels to do this communication.
393000	399000	This is one of the important applications of quantum communication.
399000	413000	More interesting quantum communication often uses a very important feature in quantum mechanics called quantum entanglement.
413000	418000	What is quantum entanglement?
418000	420000	For example, there is a quantum state here.
420000	428000	Its quantum state is a superposition of 0, 0 and 1, 1.
428000	437000	If it is such a superposition, it can send one of the light to Alice.
437000	441000	Then send the other light to Bob.
442000	447000	When Alice goes to measure the information of this light value, it can be measured to 0 or 1.
447000	452000	0 and 1 here is the quantum state of the light value.
452000	456000	For example, we can make it horizontal or vertical.
456000	462000	For example, you can define that the horizontal deviation is 0 and the vertical deviation is 1.
462000	468000	When Alice measures the quantum state, it will randomly get 0 or 1.
468000	472000	When Bob measures the quantum state, it will randomly get 0 or 1.
472000	478000	But because these two lights are in a quantum entanglement state.
478000	484000	So when Alice and Bob compare their results,
484000	489000	they will find that when Alice measures to 0, Bob will also measure to 0.
489000	492000	When Alice measures to 1, Bob will also measure to 1.
493000	499000	The characteristics of such a quantum entanglement are very important in quantum communication.
508000	515000	Using such an entanglement state can achieve so-called quantum teleportation.
515000	521000	The main reason is that you produce a quantum state of light here.
521000	526000	Then send one side to Alice and the other side to Bob.
526000	534000	Alice will do another entanglement at the local stage.
534000	542000	In this way, she can teleport the light on her side to Bob.
542000	547000	In the process, Alice did not directly throw this light to Bob.
547000	552000	But she can teleport this light to Bob.
555000	561000	Another application is that one day we can use a light
561000	567000	as a bridge between two local quantum computers.
567000	572000	For example, we can convert the quantum state here into light.
572000	583000	We can transfer this light to another quantum computer through light or air.
583000	590000	Then convert this light to the quantum state of light on the local quantum computer.
590000	598000	In this way, we can achieve a far-end connection between two quantum computers.
598000	610000	We can also use light as a quantum component in quantum computing.
610000	616000	We can use the quantum state of light to do quantum computing.
616000	622000	This is mainly some of the main applications in quantum communication.
623000	631000	In all these applications, there is a very important...
631000	635000	Can you see the screen here?
635000	637000	Is it blocking the title?
637000	639000	No?
639000	641000	OK, it's fine.
642000	644000	OK, it's fine.
648000	655000	In all these applications, there is a very important component, the so-called single light source.
655000	660000	You must have a light source that can emit a light.
660000	665000	When you want it to emit a light, it will emit a light.
665000	670000	You can trigger it to emit a series of light.
670000	676000	They are separated in space and time.
676000	684000	What is the difference between a single light source and a general light source?
684000	694000	First of all, we can imagine that a classical light emitter is like a water spray gun.
694000	699000	When you press it, it will spray out millions of water molecules.
699000	704000	For example, you can't control that I only spray one water molecule at a time.
704000	708000	But the single light source is a bit like a pistol.
708000	714000	When you trigger it, it will shoot a bullet.
716000	723000	So this is the main difference between classical and quantum light sources.
723000	735000	More specifically, the difference is in their light statistics.
735000	742000	Suppose we have a coherent light source, for example, a general laser.
742000	747000	Its light distribution is positive Poisson distribution.
747000	753000	This means that suppose you have a laser.
753000	760000	Let's say you have a very small hole.
760000	765000	The light can only pass through that hole very little at a time.
765000	772000	But no matter how you reduce the intensity of the light,
772000	777000	you will find that even if your average light number is 1,
777000	780000	when you measure its light distribution,
780000	783000	you will find that it is not all the same light.
783000	792000	40% is 0 light, 40% is 1 light, 20% is 2 light, and 5% is 3 light.
792000	798000	For example, it is not an on-demand single photon source.
799000	802000	The so-called single photon source, a perfect single photon source,
802000	805000	will meet the sub-Poisson distribution.
805000	808000	In a perfect situation, you will find that
808000	813000	the number distribution of the photon in its light source
813000	816000	is 100% when it is under 1.
816000	825000	This is the biggest difference between classical and single light sources.
826000	835000	In general, most of the so-called single light sources
835000	839000	are produced in a very simple way.
840000	842000	Hello.
842000	844000	Can I ask a question?
844000	846000	Yes.
846000	849000	Can you go back to the previous slide?
849000	856000	In quantum mechanics,
856000	862000	we have the uncertainty principle of light.
862000	865000	For any quantity of uncertainty,
865000	868000	you have delta P times delta R,
868000	870000	which is greater than the percentage bar.
870000	877000	I imagine that if you have an uncertainty distribution of light,
877000	880000	which is the standard deviation of light,
880000	885000	what is the corresponding delta something?
885000	887000	Phase.
887000	894000	The phase is completely uncertain.
894000	900000	So if you squeeze the light into a single light source,
900000	905000	the phase will have a very large standard deviation.
905000	907000	Yes.
907000	909000	Oh, okay.
909000	911000	I forgot.
911000	913000	Okay?
913000	915000	Let's continue.
915000	917000	Okay.
917000	922000	The way we produce a single light source on the mainstream
922000	924000	is actually very simple.
924000	928000	You prepare a two-level system.
928000	931000	You have a ground state and an excited state.
932000	936000	But the important thing is that in your system,
936000	941000	you basically can only see at the same time,
941000	944000	or only control one,
944000	947000	you can only have one two-level system.
947000	951000	If you can isolate a two-level system,
951000	954000	then you use light or electricity,
954000	956000	no matter what, to trigger something.
962000	964000	Are you okay?
968000	970000	You trigger it.
970000	974000	Because in your system,
974000	978000	there is only one two-level system,
978000	981000	so you can only produce one exciton.
981000	987000	This two-level system will decay in its exciton lifetime
987000	990000	back to the ground state and produce a single light source.
990000	992000	After decaying back to the ground state,
992000	994000	you trigger it again.
994000	996000	In the exciton lifetime, it will decay again.
996000	999000	Basically, you go through this cycle.
999000	1002000	Then you can produce a single light source one by one.
1002000	1006000	Basically, the mainstream single light source so far
1006000	1011000	basically uses this method.
1011000	1014000	Of course, there are some that use nonlinear queries,
1014000	1015000	which are different.
1015000	1017000	I won't discuss it here.
1018000	1023000	A single emitter or two-level system like this
1023000	1027000	can be found in many different systems.
1027000	1029000	For example,
1029000	1032000	let's use a few examples.
1032000	1034000	For example, we have a trapped ion.
1034000	1037000	Suppose you can trap an atom in your cavity.
1037000	1039000	Because there is only one atom,
1039000	1041000	when you trigger it,
1041000	1043000	it will emit light one by one.
1043000	1045000	Or let's say,
1045000	1048000	in a diamond defect,
1048000	1050000	a nitrogen vacancy,
1050000	1057000	such a defect can also be used as a single photon source.
1057000	1059000	For example,
1062000	1068000	in the recently popular 2D Transition Metal Dichrogeny,
1068000	1070000	this 2D semiconductor,
1070000	1074000	you can also use some of its structural defects
1074000	1077000	as a single light source.
1077000	1079000	Another,
1079000	1081000	currently
1081000	1085000	the most mainstream method
1085000	1088000	is to use the self-assembled quantum dot.
1088000	1090000	The self-assembled quantum dot
1090000	1094000	basically looks a bit like
1094000	1101000	you sprinkle some water droplets on a table.
1101000	1103000	Because of the surface tension,
1103000	1106000	these water droplets will be connected one by one.
1106000	1108000	After the connection,
1108000	1110000	you can cover them all
1110000	1113000	to form a single quantum dot.
1113000	1114000	For example,
1114000	1118000	I am now pointing at a single quantum dot.
1118000	1120000	These quantum dots
1120000	1123000	can also be used as a single light source.
1123000	1125000	Basically,
1125000	1127000	as you can see in this photo,
1127000	1130000	there are more than ten quantum dots.
1130000	1134000	So you have to cover all the other quantum dots.
1134000	1136000	For example, just look at this one.
1136000	1138000	If you only look at this one,
1138000	1140000	you will find that
1140000	1142000	when you stimulate it,
1142000	1144000	you will get a single photon emission.
1147000	1149000	But quantum dots
1149000	1153000	have some shortcomings.
1153000	1156000	There are some shortcomings in practical application.
1156000	1158000	One of them is
1158000	1161000	because of the way it grows,
1161000	1164000	it is difficult to control its size.
1164000	1167000	And it is difficult to control
1167000	1170000	where it will grow.
1170000	1171000	For example,
1171000	1172000	this is an example.
1172000	1174000	You see that these dots
1174000	1176000	are randomly distributed.
1176000	1178000	You can't control
1178000	1180000	that I want a dot
1180000	1182000	to grow in a certain place.
1182000	1186000	This kind of randomness
1186000	1188000	will result in
1188000	1190000	a less ideal
1190000	1193000	composition.
1193000	1196000	Another point is
1196000	1198000	when you use light
1198000	1201000	to stimulate a quantum dot,
1201000	1204000	you may get
1204000	1206000	a bi-hexatone emission.
1206000	1211000	Because of the binding energy of the bi-hexatone,
1211000	1213000	you will see that
1213000	1215000	its energy and hexatone energy
1215000	1217000	are a bit different.
1217000	1219000	In this case,
1219000	1221000	you have to use a spectrum filter
1221000	1225000	to cover the bi-hexatone
1225000	1227000	so that you can get
1227000	1232000	a pure single photon emission.
1233000	1234000	Yeah.
1234000	1235000	OK.
1235000	1238000	So this is the mainstream method.
1238000	1241000	What I'm going to talk about now is
1241000	1245000	that we want to try
1245000	1247000	a method that has been proposed
1247000	1251000	for 20 years
1251000	1255000	but has not been done
1255000	1258000	before this paper.
1258000	1261000	Basically,
1261000	1263000	what we want to do is
1263000	1265000	to mix two things together.
1265000	1266000	OK.
1266000	1267000	Basically,
1267000	1269000	you can think of it as
1269000	1272000	a LED and a wave.
1272000	1274000	This is a wave.
1274000	1276000	I'm using a wave now,
1276000	1278000	but in practice,
1278000	1280000	it's a wave.
1280000	1282000	We combine a LED
1282000	1284000	and a wave.
1284000	1287000	With some special device production,
1287000	1289000	we can achieve
1289000	1294000	a single photon emission.
1294000	1295000	Yeah.
1297000	1298000	OK.
1298000	1300000	First,
1300000	1302000	let's talk about
1302000	1307000	what the LED and the wave are.
1307000	1310000	I'm sure everyone is familiar with LEDs.
1310000	1312000	In Taiwan,
1312000	1314000	you can see a lot of advertising boards.
1314000	1317000	These things are all made with LEDs.
1317000	1321000	It's easy to find LEDs on the platform.
1321000	1322000	OK.
1322000	1330000	The main structure of LEDs
1330000	1331000	is like this.
1331000	1337000	It has a P-type semiconductor.
1337000	1340000	There are a lot of electrons in it.
1340000	1343000	Electrons are
1343000	1345000	how to say
1345000	1347000	lack of an electron.
1347000	1349000	You can compare it to a hole.
1349000	1351000	It's like an electric hole.
1351000	1353000	Here,
1353000	1355000	there is another N-type.
1355000	1356000	This section
1356000	1358000	mainly has a lot of electrons.
1358000	1362000	If we combine the electron and the electric area,
1362000	1364000	we will have a P-N junction.
1364000	1366000	The P-N junction
1366000	1368000	looks like this
1368000	1371000	in the conduction band and the valence band.
1371000	1372000	OK.
1372000	1375000	When you want them to glow,
1375000	1377000	what you have to do is
1377000	1379000	apply a forward bias
1379000	1381000	so that the electron and the electric area
1381000	1383000	can overcome
1383000	1388000	the potential barrier.
1388000	1391000	When you apply a sufficient forward bias,
1391000	1393000	the electron will flow to the electric area
1393000	1395000	and the electric area will flow to the electric area.
1395000	1397000	Then you can
1398000	1400000	combine them in this place.
1400000	1402000	When the electron sees the electric area,
1402000	1404000	it will decay
1404000	1406000	and combine with the electric area
1406000	1408000	to produce light.
1408000	1410000	This is a very simple
1410000	1412000	LED
1412000	1414000	way to produce light.
1414000	1416000	It's very simple.
1416000	1418000	Why can't we
1418000	1420000	LEDs
1420000	1422000	generate single light?
1422000	1424000	Because when you
1424000	1426000	add a forward bias,
1426000	1428000	you don't let
1428000	1430000	one electron
1430000	1432000	combine with one electric area
1432000	1434000	at a time.
1434000	1436000	At the same time,
1436000	1438000	you can't control the number.
1438000	1440000	Suppose
1440000	1442000	we can't
1442000	1444000	make a LED
1444000	1446000	and
1446000	1448000	when you
1448000	1450000	trigger it,
1450000	1452000	it will only have one electron at a time.
1452000	1454000	It will only have one electron at a time
1454000	1456000	to combine with the electric area.
1456000	1458000	In this case,
1458000	1460000	you can imagine
1460000	1462000	that it should
1462000	1464000	produce single light.
1464000	1466000	OK
1466000	1468000	Then
1468000	1470000	OK
1470000	1472000	So we talked about
1472000	1474000	a way to
1474000	1476000	transmit an electron at a time.
1476000	1478000	In this experiment,
1478000	1480000	the technique we used
1480000	1482000	is a surface wave.
1482000	1484000	A surface wave
1484000	1486000	is basically
1486000	1488000	a wave.
1488000	1490000	But this wave
1490000	1492000	will produce a dynamic
1492000	1494000	electric potential.
1494000	1496000	This potential
1496000	1498000	can carry electrons.
1498000	1500000	It's like a wave.
1500000	1502000	This wave can carry electrons
1502000	1504000	to overcome a potential barrier.
1504000	1506000	After overcoming it,
1506000	1508000	you can control
1508000	1510000	the amplitude of the surface wave.
1510000	1512000	You can control
1512000	1514000	how many electrons you need to carry at a time.
1514000	1516000	So
1516000	1518000	in theory,
1518000	1520000	if we can
1520000	1522000	carry one electron at a time,
1522000	1524000	we can
1524000	1526000	let only one electron
1526000	1528000	reach the electric area at a time.
1528000	1530000	Then we can produce a single light.
1530000	1532000	OK
1532000	1534000	What about
1534000	1536000	the surface wave?
1536000	1538000	In Taiwan,
1538000	1540000	we've all experienced it.
1540000	1542000	A surface wave
1542000	1544000	is caused by
1544000	1546000	an earthquake.
1546000	1548000	A part of the wave
1548000	1550000	is transmitted by a surface wave.
1550000	1552000	A surface wave
1552000	1554000	has a low frequency but a high amplitude.
1554000	1556000	So it's highly destructive.
1556000	1558000	It's like
1558000	1560000	a wave
1560000	1562000	transmitting on the surface.
1562000	1564000	OK
1564000	1566000	OK
1566000	1568000	As I said,
1568000	1570000	in general,
1570000	1572000	we've all experienced an earthquake.
1572000	1574000	So how can we
1574000	1576000	produce a surface wave
1576000	1578000	on a small device?
1578000	1580000	We need to
1580000	1582000	use the so-called
1582000	1584000	opamp.
1584000	1586000	The so-called opamp
1586000	1588000	is
1588000	1590000	when you
1590000	1592000	add an electric field,
1592000	1594000	it will cause a change in shape.
1594000	1596000	At the same time,
1596000	1598000	when it causes a change in shape,
1598000	1600000	it will also cause an electric field.
1600000	1602000	OK
1602000	1604000	So we
1604000	1606000	use this opamp
1606000	1608000	to produce
1608000	1610000	a surface wave
1610000	1612000	on our chip.
1612000	1614000	The method is
1614000	1616000	as shown here.
1616000	1618000	We have
1618000	1620000	a cross section
1620000	1622000	of an electric field.
1622000	1624000	The cross section
1624000	1626000	of the electric field
1626000	1628000	determines
1628000	1630000	the frequency
1630000	1632000	of the wave
1632000	1634000	when it
1634000	1636000	transmits
1636000	1638000	on the surface.
1638000	1640000	OK
1640000	1642000	When you have
1642000	1644000	something like this,
1644000	1646000	when you send an AC signal,
1646000	1648000	an RF signal,
1648000	1650000	and a GHz signal,
1650000	1652000	when it meets
1652000	1654000	the resonance frequency
1654000	1656000	of the transducer,
1656000	1658000	it will produce a surface wave.
1658000	1660000	The so-called resonance frequency
1660000	1662000	means that
1662000	1664000	the change in shape
1664000	1666000	produced by
1666000	1668000	each electrode
1668000	1670000	causes
1670000	1672000	constructive interference.
1672000	1674000	This wave will
1674000	1676000	pass through here.
1676000	1678000	OK
1678000	1680000	So
1680000	1682000	when we
1682000	1684000	use this
1684000	1686000	surface wave,
1686000	1688000	our material is
1688000	1690000	gallium arsenide.
1690000	1692000	Gallium arsenide
1692000	1694000	has the property of
1694000	1696000	suppressing materials,
1696000	1698000	so we can directly
1698000	1700000	produce a surface wave on it.
1700000	1702000	We can use this
1702000	1704000	potential wave
1704000	1706000	to move electrodes.
1706000	1708000	An experiment I did
1708000	1710000	in my previous group
1710000	1712000	is that we have two conductors,
1712000	1714000	one on the left, one on the right,
1714000	1716000	and one on the left.
1716000	1718000	At the same time,
1718000	1720000	there is only one electrode inside.
1720000	1722000	The experiment I did
1722000	1724000	is very interesting.
1724000	1726000	I can send a surface wave
1726000	1728000	in this direction,
1728000	1730000	and push this electrode
1730000	1732000	to the left.
1732000	1734000	I can also send a wave
1734000	1736000	from left to right,
1736000	1738000	and push this electrode to the right.
1738000	1740000	It can move like a table tennis ball.
1740000	1742000	They demonstrated
1742000	1744000	that they can
1744000	1746000	move 60 times.
1746000	1748000	This kind of technology
1748000	1750000	is actually
1750000	1752000	Sorry
1752000	1754000	Can you hear me?
1754000	1756000	Yes, I can.
1756000	1758000	I have a question.
1758000	1760000	I'm a high-performance engineer,
1760000	1762000	so I have a question.
1762000	1764000	How large is the potential
1764000	1766000	of the electrode
1766000	1768000	you draw below
1768000	1770000	the surface wave?
1772000	1774000	It's basically
1774000	1776000	gigahertz.
1776000	1778000	Gigahertz.
1778000	1780000	Yes, it's gigahertz.
1780000	1782000	The electrode you carried
1782000	1784000	is said to be
1784000	1786000	as close as possible to
1786000	1788000	the gap between
1788000	1790000	the surface wave and the electrode.
1790000	1792000	Is it better
1792000	1794000	or worse?
1794000	1796000	You don't want it to be bigger.
1796000	1798000	You want it to be
1798000	1800000	just the right size.
1800000	1802000	Basically, you want it to pass
1802000	1804000	the steepest
1804000	1806000	potential barrier.
1806000	1808000	At the steepest point,
1808000	1810000	it will only leave one electrode.
1810000	1812000	It's just right.
1812000	1814000	It depends on
1814000	1816000	the size of the surface wave.
1816000	1818000	Okay.
1818000	1820000	How large is the scale?
1820000	1822000	I don't know much about semiconductor.
1822000	1824000	It's probably
1824000	1826000	a few
1826000	1828000	MeV.
1830000	1832000	It's m, right?
1832000	1834000	Yes.
1834000	1836000	Okay.
1836000	1838000	Okay.
1838000	1840000	Okay.
1840000	1842000	Thank you.
1842000	1844000	You're welcome.
1844000	1846000	I have a question.
1846000	1848000	Okay.
1848000	1850000	Here,
1850000	1852000	in the transport
1852000	1854000	experiment,
1854000	1856000	from left to right,
1856000	1858000	what is the
1858000	1860000	distance
1860000	1862000	transmitted?
1862000	1864000	The
1864000	1866000	length scale here
1866000	1868000	is one UAM.
1868000	1870000	So, have they
1870000	1872000	tried...
1872000	1874000	5 to 6 microns.
1874000	1876000	5 to 6 microns.
1876000	1878000	So,
1878000	1880000	this experiment was done
1880000	1882000	at low temperature.
1882000	1884000	Yes.
1884000	1886000	You have to be able to
1886000	1888000	define a quantum dot with an electrode.
1888000	1890000	So, you have to
1890000	1892000	do it at low temperature
1892000	1894000	to see the discrete state.
1896000	1898000	It's probably
1898000	1900000	I forgot.
1900000	1902000	It's probably 1K or 200
1902000	1904000	microns.
1904000	1906000	Okay, got it.
1906000	1908000	I also have a
1908000	1910000	question.
1910000	1912000	That is,
1912000	1914000	does this wave
1914000	1916000	need to be horizontal or vertical?
1916000	1918000	The second question is
1918000	1920000	that
1920000	1922000	the electrode is very small.
1922000	1924000	So, the electrical field
1924000	1926000	it feels locally should be...
1926000	1928000	If your wave is
1928000	1930000	symmetric,
1930000	1932000	the electrical field it feels should be
1932000	1934000	oscillating back and forth.
1934000	1936000	So, do you need to
1936000	1938000	make the surface acoustic wave
1938000	1940000	as asymmetric
1940000	1942000	so that it has a
1942000	1944000	directional run?
1944000	1946000	No.
1948000	1950000	No.
1950000	1952000	So, it just followed the first wave?
1952000	1954000	Yes.
1954000	1956000	Okay.
1956000	1958000	Does this
1958000	1960000	surface acoustic wave
1960000	1962000	need to be horizontal or vertical?
1968000	1970000	It produces...
1976000	1978000	Let me think about it.
1986000	1988000	It produces...
1988000	1990000	It should be
1990000	1992000	horizontal.
1996000	1998000	Acoustic should be horizontal.
2004000	2006000	Acoustic can be horizontal
2006000	2008000	or vertical.
2008000	2010000	But it produces...
2010000	2012000	I don't know.
2012000	2014000	I don't know.
2014000	2016000	I don't know
2016000	2018000	if the transducer
2018000	2020000	produces a horizontal or vertical wave.
2020000	2022000	Okay.
2022000	2024000	I think...
2024000	2026000	I don't know if I have it here.
2028000	2030000	So, we can
2030000	2032000	see it like this.
2032000	2034000	Actually,
2034000	2036000	the direction
2036000	2038000	is like this.
2038000	2040000	Circular.
2040000	2042000	Okay.
2044000	2046000	So, it's mixed together.
2046000	2048000	Yes, it's mixed together.
2048000	2050000	It's really like water.
2050000	2052000	Yes, it's mixed together.
2052000	2054000	So, it's not just a wave.
2054000	2056000	Yes.
2056000	2058000	Okay.
2058000	2060000	So, I hope
2060000	2062000	I answered your question.
2062000	2064000	Yes.
2064000	2066000	Okay.
2066000	2068000	Last question.
2068000	2070000	Can this
2070000	2072000	produce a standing wave?
2072000	2074000	Yes, it can.
2074000	2076000	Yes.
2078000	2080000	So, if I produce a standing wave
2080000	2082000	and there is a transducer
2082000	2084000	on both sides
2084000	2086000	and produce a standing wave,
2086000	2088000	is it possible...
2088000	2090000	Because now
2090000	2092000	the speed of the wave
2092000	2094000	should be
2094000	2096000	similar to
2096000	2098000	the speed of
2098000	2100000	the semiconductor.
2100000	2102000	Yes, but if there is
2102000	2104000	a transducer on both sides,
2104000	2106000	if you change the relative phase
2106000	2108000	on one side,
2108000	2110000	you can basically move
2110000	2112000	the wave slowly.
2112000	2114000	Yes.
2114000	2116000	Can you do it?
2116000	2118000	I think I can do it.
2118000	2120000	Yes.
2120000	2122000	It won't be limited to this.
2122000	2124000	Okay.
2124000	2126000	Yes, I think I can do it.
2126000	2128000	Yes, I think I can do it.
2128000	2130000	But...
2130000	2132000	I think I forgot who said that.
2132000	2134000	But I don't think I have
2134000	2136000	done this before.
2136000	2138000	Yes.
2140000	2142000	Okay.
2142000	2144000	I have a question.
2144000	2146000	Yes.
2146000	2148000	How do you make sure
2148000	2150000	that is a single electron?
2150000	2152000	How do you measure it?
2152000	2154000	So,
2154000	2156000	a structure like this
2156000	2158000	has two quantum dots.
2158000	2160000	One on the left, one on the right.
2160000	2162000	But there is
2162000	2164000	a channel like this.
2164000	2166000	There is a channel like this.
2166000	2168000	This channel
2168000	2170000	has a very sensitive
2170000	2172000	conductance.
2172000	2174000	Basically,
2174000	2176000	if there are 0, 1, or 2 electrons,
2176000	2178000	it will affect
2178000	2180000	the channel conductance.
2180000	2182000	So the way to measure
2182000	2184000	the number of electrons
2184000	2186000	is to measure
2186000	2188000	the channel conductance.
2188000	2190000	It can
2190000	2192000	tell if there are
2192000	2194000	0, 1, or 2 electrons.
2194000	2196000	Yes.
2196000	2198000	This is a very
2198000	2200000	common technology
2200000	2202000	in gate-defined quantum dots.
2202000	2204000	It's called charge detector or charge sensor.
2206000	2208000	Okay, thank you.
2208000	2210000	Okay.
2210000	2212000	Is this QPC?
2212000	2214000	This is QPC.
2214000	2216000	Okay.
2216000	2218000	This is QPC.
2218000	2220000	If you want to have another quantum dot,
2220000	2222000	you can use charge sensor.
2222000	2224000	But it's easier to do it in this experiment.
2224000	2226000	Okay.
2226000	2228000	It's okay.
2228000	2230000	I just want to make sure.
2230000	2232000	Okay.
2232000	2234000	Okay.
2234000	2236000	So, I mentioned
2236000	2238000	that I combined two things.
2238000	2240000	LED and surface wave.
2240000	2242000	Let's combine these two things.
2242000	2244000	We want to
2244000	2246000	combine these two things
2246000	2248000	to produce a surface wave.
2248000	2250000	This is how we do it.
2250000	2252000	I'll show you an animation later.
2252000	2254000	But I'll use my mouth to explain.
2254000	2256000	I'll
2256000	2258000	make a LED first.
2258000	2260000	I have electrons here.
2260000	2262000	I have electrons here.
2262000	2264000	I have electrons here.
2264000	2266000	I'll make a surface wave.
2266000	2268000	This surface wave
2268000	2270000	will modulate
2270000	2272000	the potential of conduction band
2272000	2274000	and valence band.
2274000	2276000	What's more,
2276000	2278000	an important component
2278000	2280000	is that
2280000	2282000	I want to create
2282000	2284000	a 1D channel
2284000	2286000	in the middle of
2286000	2288000	the electromagnetic field.
2288000	2290000	This 1D channel
2290000	2292000	can control
2292000	2294000	the width.
2294000	2296000	Basically,
2296000	2298000	you can add two side gates
2298000	2300000	to control the height of the potential.
2300000	2302000	You can control
2302000	2304000	the width of the channel.
2304000	2306000	You can control
2306000	2308000	the width of the channel
2308000	2310000	so that only one electron
2310000	2312000	can pass through.
2312000	2314000	If only one electron can pass through
2314000	2316000	and produce a surface wave,
2316000	2318000	let's assume
2318000	2320000	that the potential
2320000	2322000	between the electromagnetic field
2322000	2324000	and the wavelength
2324000	2326000	allows the surface wave
2326000	2328000	to produce a single light
2328000	2330000	when only one electron
2330000	2332000	can pass through.
2332000	2334000	Now I have an animation.
2334000	2336000	I hope you can
2336000	2338000	watch it smoothly.
2342000	2344000	This is my device.
2344000	2346000	This is my device.
2346000	2348000	This is the
2348000	2350000	energy diagram.
2350000	2352000	This is the
2352000	2354000	electromagnetic field.
2354000	2356000	This is the 1D channel.
2356000	2358000	The potential of this 1D channel
2358000	2360000	is controlled by the side gate.
2360000	2362000	When I hit the surface wave,
2362000	2364000	it will start to push the electrons.
2364000	2366000	The electrons will push
2366000	2368000	forward.
2368000	2370000	Because of the channel,
2370000	2372000	only one electron can pass through.
2372000	2374000	When this electron is combined
2374000	2376000	with an electron,
2376000	2378000	it produces a single light.
2378000	2380000	The potential will carry
2380000	2382000	the next electron.
2382000	2384000	So it will produce a single light
2384000	2386000	one by one.
2396000	2398000	This is
2398000	2400000	how I
2400000	2402000	produce a single light.
2402000	2404000	Any questions?
2404000	2406000	I think you will
2406000	2408000	talk about it later.
2408000	2410000	So,
2410000	2412000	the gate on both sides
2412000	2414000	control the Fermi level
2414000	2416000	so that
2416000	2418000	both sides
2418000	2420000	are electric.
2420000	2422000	Yes, I will talk about it later.
2422000	2424000	I guess you will talk about it later.
2424000	2426000	Sorry to interrupt you.
2426000	2428000	So next I will talk about
2428000	2430000	how to make this device.
2430000	2432000	Basically,
2432000	2434000	what's interesting about this project
2434000	2436000	is that I don't need
2436000	2438000	a random quantum dot
2438000	2440000	or a defect.
2440000	2442000	This device
2442000	2444000	can be
2444000	2446000	fabricated
2446000	2448000	deterministically
2448000	2450000	in any
2450000	2452000	place I want.
2452000	2454000	What it needs
2454000	2456000	is
2456000	2458000	very conventional
2458000	2460000	photolithography and
2460000	2462000	electromagnetic electron.
2462000	2464000	You don't need
2464000	2466000	any random
2466000	2468000	thing.
2468000	2470000	This kind of
2470000	2472000	device is
2472000	2474000	good for
2474000	2476000	software integration.
2476000	2478000	So,
2478000	2480000	the starting point is
2480000	2482000	GaN and
2482000	2484000	AuGaS's quantum web.
2484000	2486000	I didn't show
2486000	2488000	the diagram here.
2488000	2490000	It is
2490000	2492000	a plane
2492000	2494000	that allows
2494000	2496000	electrons and electrons
2496000	2498000	to exist.
2498000	2500000	First of all,
2502000	2504000	the next step is
2504000	2506000	to pattern
2506000	2508000	two surface gates.
2508000	2510000	Here is a surface gate
2510000	2512000	and here is another surface gate.
2512000	2514000	These two surface gates
2514000	2516000	are used
2516000	2518000	to accumulate
2518000	2520000	electrons and holes.
2520000	2522000	For example,
2522000	2524000	if I want to
2524000	2526000	generate electrons here,
2526000	2528000	I just add a positive
2528000	2530000	voltage to this gate
2530000	2532000	to accumulate electrons.
2532000	2534000	Here,
2534000	2536000	I just add a negative voltage
2536000	2538000	to accumulate electrons.
2542000	2544000	When I add the voltage,
2544000	2546000	I can control
2546000	2548000	electrons and holes.
2548000	2550000	What's more convenient is that
2550000	2552000	electrons and holes
2552000	2554000	are controlled by voltage.
2554000	2556000	I can even
2556000	2558000	swap them.
2558000	2560000	I can have electrons
2560000	2562000	and holes on both sides.
2562000	2564000	This is
2564000	2566000	a flexible
2566000	2568000	device.
2570000	2572000	Next,
2572000	2574000	I just mentioned
2574000	2576000	that I need a 1D channel
2576000	2578000	so that
2578000	2580000	each time
2580000	2582000	only one electron
2582000	2584000	can pass through.
2584000	2586000	I will make an etch.
2586000	2588000	Basically, I will use
2588000	2590000	the method of 10 electrons
2590000	2592000	to eat up
2592000	2594000	the electrons and holes
2594000	2596000	where electrons and holes
2596000	2598000	can exist.
2598000	2600000	The dark part
2600000	2602000	of electrons and holes
2602000	2604000	can't exist.
2604000	2606000	Therefore,
2606000	2608000	they can only pass through
2608000	2610000	the middle path.
2610000	2612000	Maybe
2612000	2614000	the etched channel
2614000	2616000	is still too wide.
2616000	2618000	I may need to add
2618000	2620000	two side gates
2620000	2622000	to control
2622000	2624000	the size of
2624000	2626000	the channel.
2626000	2628000	OK.
2628000	2630000	Next,
2630000	2632000	let's search.
2632000	2634000	Excuse me.
2634000	2636000	Hello.
2636000	2638000	I have a question.
2638000	2640000	You showed the picture.
2640000	2642000	How wide is the channel?
2642000	2644000	Is it sub-micron?
2644000	2646000	It's about a micron.
2646000	2648000	I will show the device later.
2648000	2650000	Thank you.
2650000	2652000	I will show the actual device.
2652000	2654000	I want to ask
2654000	2656000	a stupid question.
2656000	2658000	The etched channel
2658000	2660000	has
2660000	2662000	gallium arsenide and
2662000	2664000	aluminum gallium arsenide.
2664000	2666000	It's
2666000	2668000	aluminum gallium arsenide
2668000	2670000	and gallium arsenide.
2670000	2672000	It's a quantum well.
2672000	2674000	Does the etched channel
2674000	2676000	exceed
2676000	2678000	the two-deck?
2678000	2680000	Yes, it exceeds
2680000	2682000	the two-deck.
2682000	2684000	It exceeds the two-deck.
2684000	2686000	Yes, it exceeds the two-deck.
2686000	2688000	If you
2688000	2690000	control
2690000	2692000	the voltage
2692000	2694000	below the two-deck,
2694000	2696000	does it affect
2696000	2698000	the width
2698000	2700000	and narrowness
2700000	2702000	of the two-deck?
2702000	2704000	I think so.
2704000	2706000	It's right next to the two-deck.
2706000	2708000	Yes.
2708000	2710000	OK.
2710000	2712000	I just thought of it.
2712000	2714000	Sorry.
2714000	2716000	The etched channel
2716000	2718000	affects the two-deck.
2718000	2720000	It doesn't affect
2720000	2722000	the two-deck.
2722000	2724000	It affects the two-deck.
2724000	2726000	The two-deck is close to the two-deck.
2726000	2728000	It affects the two-deck.
2728000	2730000	Yes.
2732000	2734000	I will continue.
2736000	2738000	Next,
2738000	2740000	I want to generate
2740000	2742000	a surface wave.
2742000	2744000	I will make a transducer.
2744000	2746000	It's the one I just mentioned.
2746000	2748000	It's a transverse
2748000	2750000	electrode.
2752000	2754000	After I add
2754000	2756000	a transducer,
2756000	2758000	I can
2758000	2760000	use
2760000	2762000	the RF frequency
2762000	2764000	to
2764000	2766000	generate a
2766000	2768000	surface wave.
2768000	2770000	It will push
2770000	2772000	the electrode
2772000	2774000	to the
2774000	2776000	electric area.
2776000	2778000	When the electrode
2778000	2780000	is pushed to the electric area,
2780000	2782000	it will
2782000	2784000	combine
2784000	2786000	with
2786000	2788000	one of the electrodes.
2788000	2790000	The two electrodes will
2790000	2792000	form an exon.
2792000	2794000	After the two electrons form an exon,
2794000	2796000	the two electrodes will decay
2796000	2798000	to form a photon.
2798000	2800000	Basically,
2800000	2802000	this is how we
2802000	2804000	generate a single-beam.
2804000	2806000	I just showed you the animation,
2806000	2808000	but now I will show you
2808000	2810000	step by step.
2810000	2812000	This is
2812000	2814000	my actual device.
2816000	2818000	This is my
2818000	2820000	sole transducer.
2820000	2822000	I use it to generate the sole finger.
2822000	2824000	This electrode
2824000	2826000	is too small, so you can't see it.
2826000	2828000	But it's basically
2828000	2830000	a transverse electrode.
2830000	2832000	The gate
2832000	2834000	to accumulate
2834000	2836000	the electron hole is here.
2836000	2838000	You can't see it now, but you will
2838000	2840000	see it in the next image.
2840000	2842000	It looks like this.
2844000	2846000	This side is for
2846000	2848000	accumulating the electron, and this side
2848000	2850000	is for accumulating the hole.
2850000	2852000	For example,
2852000	2854000	these black spots
2854000	2856000	are where I use
2856000	2858000	VH to remove them.
2858000	2860000	These
2860000	2862000	dark spots
2862000	2864000	are where electrons and electrons can't exist.
2864000	2866000	The surface wave
2866000	2868000	will come from this direction.
2868000	2870000	It will
2870000	2872000	pass the electrons
2872000	2874000	to the electron area.
2874000	2876000	Next,
2876000	2878000	I will talk about
2878000	2880000	the results of the experiment.
2884000	2886000	First, I mentioned
2886000	2888000	that this is basically
2888000	2890000	an LED plus a
2890000	2892000	surface wave.
2892000	2894000	I need to make sure
2894000	2896000	that my device
2896000	2898000	works like an LED.
2898000	2900000	So,
2900000	2902000	what I am doing is
2902000	2904000	I am accumulating the electron
2904000	2906000	on one side, and then
2906000	2908000	accumulating the hole on the other side.
2908000	2910000	Then, I can apply
2910000	2912000	a source-engineering bias.
2912000	2914000	A bias.
2914000	2916000	Theoretically,
2916000	2918000	you would expect that
2918000	2920000	when the bias
2920000	2922000	is greater than
2922000	2924000	the Gaussian bandgap,
2924000	2926000	it will
2926000	2928000	allow the electron
2928000	2930000	to overcome
2930000	2932000	the potential barrier.
2932000	2934000	The same goes for the electron.
2934000	2936000	The electron can run to the other side.
2936000	2938000	In this case, you will see the current.
2938000	2940000	Basically,
2940000	2942000	the Gaussian bandgap
2942000	2944000	is about
2944000	2946000	1.55EV.
2946000	2948000	So,
2948000	2950000	you will see
2950000	2952000	when I apply a bias,
2952000	2954000	when the bias is greater than
2954000	2956000	1.54EV,
2956000	2958000	the current will start to occur.
2958000	2960000	Basically,
2960000	2962000	this graph
2962000	2964000	shows that
2964000	2966000	my lateral
2966000	2968000	p-n junction
2968000	2970000	really works.
2970000	2972000	OK.
2972000	2974000	OK.
2974000	2976000	Next,
2976000	2978000	when we want to create a source-driven
2978000	2980000	single-photon source,
2980000	2982000	what we need to do is
2982000	2984000	make it unable to shine
2984000	2986000	normally.
2986000	2988000	So, what we need to do is
2988000	2990000	reduce the bias
2990000	2992000	to 1.45EV.
2992000	2994000	Basically,
2994000	2996000	if I extend it,
2996000	2998000	it's about here.
2998000	3000000	So, basically,
3000000	3002000	if you don't do anything,
3002000	3004000	when the bias
3004000	3006000	is kept at 1.45EV,
3006000	3008000	nothing will happen.
3008000	3010000	There will be no current flowing,
3010000	3012000	and there will be no light.
3012000	3014000	OK.
3014000	3016000	When I
3016000	3018000	add an
3018000	3020000	RF signal,
3020000	3022000	an AC signal on the
3022000	3024000	soul transducer,
3024000	3026000	at its resonant frequency,
3026000	3028000	it will produce a surface wave.
3028000	3030000	Then you will expect that
3030000	3032000	at the frequency
3032000	3034000	of the surface wave,
3034000	3036000	if it can carry
3036000	3038000	electrons
3038000	3040000	to the electric field,
3040000	3042000	you will see the current.
3042000	3044000	OK.
3044000	3046000	Basically, it's like
3046000	3048000	an elevator.
3048000	3050000	When you draw the potential,
3050000	3052000	it will look like this.
3052000	3054000	The blue part is
3054000	3056000	when you don't add
3056000	3058000	the soul,
3058000	3060000	the potential will look like this.
3060000	3062000	When you add a soul,
3062000	3064000	it will start to look like this.
3064000	3066000	The soul will move forward,
3066000	3068000	and the electrons will move up,
3068000	3070000	and bring it to the electric field.
3070000	3072000	It's like an elevator.
3072000	3074000	It's like an elevator.
3076000	3078000	OK.
3078000	3080000	Here,
3080000	3082000	I'm showing that
3082000	3084000	when I
3084000	3086000	add RF signal,
3086000	3088000	when I
3088000	3090000	satisfy the soul transducer
3090000	3092000	resonant frequency,
3092000	3094000	I will see
3094000	3096000	something happen.
3096000	3098000	At this X axis,
3098000	3100000	I'm measuring the
3100000	3102000	AC signal frequency.
3102000	3104000	Then,
3104000	3106000	at the Y axis,
3106000	3108000	I'm measuring the current
3108000	3110000	size.
3110000	3112000	Basically, you can see
3112000	3114000	that at about
3114000	3116000	1.16 GHz,
3116000	3118000	around 1.16 GHz,
3120000	3122000	you will see a current
3122000	3124000	suddenly generate.
3124000	3126000	Other than that,
3126000	3128000	there is no signal.
3128000	3130000	At this frequency,
3130000	3132000	we designed
3132000	3134000	the soul transducer's resonant frequency.
3134000	3136000	So you can see
3136000	3138000	that at this
3138000	3140000	resonant frequency,
3140000	3142000	it seems
3142000	3144000	that the surface sound is generated,
3144000	3146000	and the electrons
3146000	3148000	are brought from the electron field to the electric field.
3148000	3150000	So we see a current generate.
3150000	3152000	At the same time,
3152000	3154000	we can also measure
3154000	3156000	the light signal.
3156000	3158000	Now,
3158000	3160000	the blue part
3160000	3162000	is the current,
3162000	3164000	and the red part
3164000	3166000	is the light signal.
3166000	3168000	You can see that the light signal
3168000	3170000	and the current signal
3170000	3172000	are basically matched.
3172000	3174000	At the same frequency,
3174000	3176000	I see the current.
3176000	3178000	This current
3178000	3180000	represents the electrons
3180000	3182000	being brought to the electric field.
3182000	3184000	Electrons and electrons are combined,
3184000	3186000	so the light is generated.
3186000	3188000	You can see that the light signal
3188000	3190000	and the current signal
3190000	3192000	are basically matched.
3192000	3194000	Because the area of light
3194000	3196000	is only
3196000	3198000	about a microsquare.
3198000	3200000	So this is
3200000	3202000	basically
3204000	3206000	to scan the light signal.
3206000	3208000	Then I found that
3208000	3210000	I saw light in a very small area.
3210000	3212000	Light is generated in this area.
3212000	3214000	This area
3214000	3216000	basically corresponds to
3216000	3218000	the location of the electric field
3218000	3220000	we designed.
3222000	3224000	Okay.
3226000	3228000	I just
3228000	3230000	described
3230000	3232000	that
3232000	3234000	at this resonant frequency,
3234000	3236000	there seems to be a wave on the surface
3236000	3238000	that causes
3238000	3240000	electrons to be brought to the electric field
3240000	3242000	to emit light.
3242000	3244000	But we want to further prove that this is true.
3244000	3246000	So what we do
3246000	3248000	is that we have a
3248000	3250000	time-resolved optical setup.
3250000	3252000	Basically,
3252000	3254000	I want to measure
3254000	3256000	how the light
3256000	3258000	emits
3258000	3260000	over time.
3260000	3262000	How do we
3262000	3264000	do this?
3264000	3266000	We have a pulse generator
3266000	3268000	and an RF source
3268000	3270000	to drive
3270000	3272000	the wave on the surface.
3272000	3274000	First, we synchronize it.
3274000	3276000	Then,
3276000	3278000	I synchronize the pulse
3278000	3280000	with the RF signal.
3280000	3282000	Then,
3282000	3284000	I send the pulse
3284000	3286000	to a
3286000	3288000	Time-to-Digital Converter.
3288000	3290000	When the
3290000	3292000	converter receives
3292000	3294000	the pulse signal,
3294000	3296000	it is a stopped pulse.
3296000	3298000	Then it starts to count.
3298000	3300000	After it receives the signal,
3300000	3302000	how long
3302000	3304000	will my
3304000	3306000	light detector receive
3306000	3308000	one light?
3308000	3310000	Or multiple lights,
3310000	3312000	as long as there is a light signal.
3312000	3314000	Once it receives the light signal,
3314000	3316000	it will send a stopped pulse.
3316000	3318000	Then the Time-to-Digital Converter
3318000	3320000	will give
3320000	3322000	the time delay
3322000	3324000	between light and pulse.
3326000	3328000	If my RF source
3328000	3330000	looks like this,
3330000	3332000	and if my soul
3332000	3334000	is the same phase,
3334000	3336000	then my
3336000	3338000	photon
3338000	3340000	will be carried
3340000	3342000	by the soul's
3342000	3344000	minimum.
3344000	3346000	So the moment it is generated
3346000	3348000	is basically the same as the
3348000	3350000	minimum time.
3350000	3352000	If my RF signal looks like this,
3352000	3354000	then my Time-to-Digital
3354000	3356000	Converter's
3356000	3358000	histogram will look like this.
3358000	3360000	It will be a signal
3360000	3362000	with a time interval.
3364000	3366000	For example,
3366000	3368000	at 0.5 ns,
3368000	3370000	I will have a very strong signal.
3370000	3372000	At 1.5 ns,
3372000	3374000	I will have a very strong signal.
3374000	3376000	At 2.5 ns,
3376000	3378000	I will have another signal.
3378000	3380000	Basically, it will be the same
3380000	3382000	as the RF source's
3382000	3384000	cycle,
3384000	3386000	as well as the soul's cycle.
3390000	3392000	Next,
3392000	3394000	I want to prove that
3394000	3396000	this signal really comes from
3396000	3398000	the surface wave.
3398000	3400000	I believe everyone in Taiwan,
3400000	3402000	because I just mentioned an earthquake.
3402000	3404000	As we all know,
3404000	3406000	an earthquake occurs in Hualien.
3406000	3408000	When you are in Hsinchu,
3408000	3410000	when you feel it,
3410000	3412000	there will be a time interval in the middle.
3414000	3416000	We can use
3416000	3418000	such a time interval
3418000	3420000	to prove that
3420000	3422000	this signal really comes from
3422000	3424000	the surface wave.
3426000	3428000	First of all, my device,
3428000	3430000	its soul transducer
3430000	3432000	and my p-n junction,
3432000	3434000	its interval is about
3434000	3436000	1 m.
3436000	3438000	I also know that
3438000	3440000	the surface wave's speed
3440000	3442000	on gallium arsenide is
3442000	3444000	about 3000 ms.
3444000	3446000	You can calculate
3446000	3448000	its propagation time
3448000	3450000	is about 400 ns.
3450000	3452000	So when you
3452000	3454000	hit a pole...
3454000	3456000	Sorry.
3456000	3458000	We are running out of time.
3458000	3460000	I don't know how much time you have left.
3460000	3462000	Maybe you should speed up.
3462000	3464000	OK. Thank you.
3464000	3466000	OK.
3466000	3468000	So we know that
3468000	3470000	there will be a time delay of 400 ns.
3470000	3472000	What I do here is
3472000	3474000	I have a time delay.
3474000	3476000	I have a pole.
3476000	3478000	I hit the pole's RF signal.
3478000	3480000	When the pole's RF signal
3480000	3482000	is applied to the soul transducer,
3482000	3484000	I see that
3484000	3486000	there is no signal.
3486000	3488000	But interestingly,
3488000	3490000	after 400 ns,
3490000	3492000	I can see a lot of RF signals.
3492000	3494000	This delay
3494000	3496000	proves that
3496000	3498000	this signal is really
3498000	3500000	caused by the soul's
3500000	3502000	propagation
3502000	3504000	and the electron's
3504000	3506000	interaction with the electron.
3506000	3508000	What's more interesting is
3508000	3510000	when I zoom in
3510000	3512000	to these RF signals,
3512000	3514000	I can see that
3514000	3516000	they are a series of peaks.
3516000	3518000	A pile of peaks.
3518000	3520000	The cycle of these peaks
3520000	3522000	is exactly the same as the period of the soul.
3522000	3524000	This means that
3524000	3526000	we are really using the soul
3526000	3528000	to inject
3528000	3530000	each electron
3530000	3532000	into the electric field.
3532000	3534000	This proves that this is really
3534000	3536000	the light signal produced by the soul.
3536000	3538000	OK.
3538000	3540000	I'm almost at the end.
3540000	3542000	In the end,
3542000	3544000	how do we really prove
3544000	3546000	that we produce a single ray?
3546000	3548000	One thing is that
3548000	3550000	when a single ray
3550000	3552000	has two cameras,
3552000	3554000	this single ray
3554000	3556000	can only be seen
3556000	3558000	by one of the cameras.
3558000	3560000	It can't be received
3560000	3562000	by two cameras at the same time.
3562000	3564000	So it's not received by camera 1,
3564000	3566000	but by camera 2.
3566000	3568000	OK.
3568000	3570000	Suppose I have
3570000	3572000	a
3572000	3574000	time series digital converter.
3574000	3576000	I go to see its start
3576000	3578000	and stop.
3578000	3580000	Because it
3580000	3582000	can only be received
3582000	3584000	by one detector
3584000	3586000	at the same time.
3586000	3588000	You will find that
3588000	3590000	when a single ray
3590000	3592000	is really produced,
3592000	3594000	there will be no time delay
3594000	3596000	equal to 0.
3596000	3598000	Because time delay equal to 0
3598000	3600000	means that two detectors receive the light signal at the same time.
3600000	3602000	OK.
3602000	3604000	So there will be no time delay equal to 0.
3604000	3606000	OK.
3606000	3608000	Here is an example.
3608000	3610000	This is a very good single ray on the file.
3610000	3612000	You will see a signal like this.
3612000	3614000	When time delay equal to 0,
3614000	3616000	there is no peak.
3616000	3618000	There are peaks in other places,
3618000	3620000	but there is no peak at 0.
3620000	3622000	OK. Now back to my experiment.
3622000	3624000	First of all,
3624000	3626000	when I send
3626000	3628000	more than one light,
3628000	3630000	one electron,
3630000	3632000	through an autocorrelation histogram like this,
3632000	3634000	I will see that
3634000	3636000	when time delay equal to 0,
3636000	3638000	there is still a very obvious peak.
3638000	3640000	And it's about the same height as everyone else.
3640000	3642000	However,
3642000	3644000	when I control the strength of my source
3644000	3646000	and the height of my
3646000	3648000	potential barrier,
3648000	3650000	I can control
3650000	3652000	only one electron
3652000	3654000	through each time.
3654000	3656000	On average, there is only one electron
3656000	3658000	combined with the electric current.
3658000	3660000	Then it becomes like this.
3660000	3662000	You can see that
3662000	3664000	the peak of time delay equal to 0
3664000	3666000	is obviously suppressed.
3666000	3668000	It's not 0.
3668000	3670000	It's different from the
3670000	3672000	very good single photon source I showed earlier.
3672000	3674000	It's not perfect.
3674000	3676000	I can only say
3676000	3678000	that
3678000	3680000	there is still a certain chance
3680000	3682000	that two light will be generated at the same time.
3682000	3684000	But the chance of
3684000	3686000	one light is
3686000	3688000	increased.
3688000	3690000	Basically, the signal of time delay equal to 0
3690000	3692000	is suppressed.
3692000	3694000	Then I can
3694000	3696000	do a probability estimate.
3696000	3698000	I can compare
3698000	3700000	in the same situation.
3700000	3702000	Suppose it's a Poisson distribution.
3702000	3704000	It's a black
3704000	3706000	rectangle like this.
3706000	3708000	Suppose
3708000	3710000	it's my source.
3710000	3712000	I can see that the probability of a single photon
3712000	3714000	is increased.
3714000	3716000	Then the other
3716000	3718000	states of 0 light and multiple photons
3718000	3720000	are suppressed.
3720000	3722000	My experiment
3722000	3724000	shows that
3724000	3726000	because of this design,
3726000	3728000	the probability of
3728000	3730000	increasing single photon emission
3730000	3732000	is increased.
3732000	3734000	OK.
3734000	3736000	These are the results of my experiment.
3736000	3738000	Thank you.
3744000	3746000	OK.
3746000	3748000	Does anyone
3748000	3750000	have any questions?
3752000	3754000	Can I ask a question?
3756000	3758000	Sorry.
3758000	3760000	You go first.
3760000	3762000	I want to ask
3762000	3764000	how do you think
3764000	3766000	to correct the imperfect part
3766000	3768000	you just said?
3768000	3770000	How do you correct
3770000	3772000	the imperfect part?
3772000	3774000	OK.
3774000	3776000	For example,
3776000	3778000	I think there is a problem.
3778000	3780000	The confinement
3780000	3782000	caused by SOHL
3782000	3784000	is not strong enough.
3784000	3786000	So
3786000	3788000	this
3788000	3790000	this
3790000	3792000	in this
3792000	3794000	during the transmission of SOHL,
3794000	3796000	the number of electrons
3796000	3798000	is not
3798000	3800000	completely
3800000	3802000	one by one.
3802000	3804000	Sometimes it's two or sometimes it's zero.
3804000	3806000	I should
3806000	3808000	improve my confinement
3808000	3810000	so that
3810000	3812000	the probability of
3812000	3814000	single electron emission is higher.
3814000	3816000	That's basically it.
3818000	3820000	Thank you.
3820000	3822000	OK. Thank you.
3824000	3826000	Can I change my turn?
3826000	3828000	OK.
3828000	3830000	My question is
3830000	3832000	I want to
3832000	3834000	use the
3834000	3836000	Garmin Ascend to make a
3836000	3838000	dark matter detector.
3838000	3840000	Can we contact you later?
3840000	3842000	I think there are some bad details
3842000	3844000	and some noise.
3844000	3846000	OK.
3846000	3848000	OK.
3848000	3850000	Anyway, my question is
3850000	3852000	if you don't use
3852000	3854000	your SOHL to drive
3854000	3856000	the channel,
3856000	3858000	it's like
3858000	3860000	a calibration run.
3860000	3862000	Will it leak?
3862000	3864000	Will it leak to the other side?
3864000	3866000	Will it leak to the other side?
3866000	3868000	You can still see it.
3868000	3870000	I'm not sure what you mean.
3870000	3872000	You said don't use SOHL.
3872000	3874000	You said don't use SOHL.
3874000	3876000	Yes. Don't use it.
3876000	3878000	And you keep measuring.
3878000	3880000	Can you measure anything?
3880000	3882000	There should be only background.
3882000	3884000	There should be only background.
3884000	3886000	First of all, there is no light.
3886000	3888000	Electronics can't
3888000	3890000	combine with electronics.
3890000	3892000	There will be no light signal.
3892000	3894000	So you can see the background
3894000	3896000	on both sides.
3896000	3898000	But you can't see
3898000	3900000	the random event
3900000	3902000	of your single photon.
3902000	3904000	The light signal on the other side
3904000	3906000	may not come from the device,
3906000	3908000	but from the environment.
3908000	3910000	Yes. But in my scenario,
3910000	3912000	I don't know when it will appear.
3912000	3914000	If I want to use it as a detector,
3914000	3916000	I need to know
3916000	3918000	the random event rate.
3918000	3920000	What do you mean?
3920000	3922000	If I don't trigger it,
3922000	3924000	will there be a fake event?
3924000	3926000	What will the fake event look like?
3926000	3928000	What is its source?
3932000	3934000	First of all,
3934000	3936000	the source of the noise
3936000	3938000	may be the detector itself.
3938000	3940000	It depends on what kind of detector you use.
3940000	3942000	For example,
3942000	3944000	we use the Avalanche
3944000	3946000	single photon dive.
3946000	3948000	Even if you
3948000	3950000	cover all the light,
3950000	3952000	there may still be
3952000	3954000	10 coms
3954000	3956000	every second.
3956000	3958000	These 10 coms are all fake.
3958000	3960000	This has nothing to do with the real signal.
3964000	3966000	Of course, there are some
3966000	3968000	fake events.
3970000	3972000	So you mean
3972000	3974000	the background counting
3974000	3976000	comes from your
3976000	3978000	APD, right?
3978000	3980000	Yes.
3980000	3982000	Or if you have a
3982000	3984000	more powerful device,
3984000	3986000	it may also come.
3986000	3988000	I imagine
3988000	3990000	there must be a pulse tube
3990000	3992000	in your refrigerator.
3992000	3994000	If the pulse tube keeps shaking,
3994000	3996000	it means
3996000	3998000	you didn't pulse your source,
3998000	4000000	and there will still be an event.
4002000	4004000	The frequency
4004000	4006000	should match the resonance frequency.
4010000	4012000	Oh, I see.
4014000	4016000	I understand.
4016000	4018000	We will keep in touch.
4018000	4020000	This is very important to me.
4020000	4022000	Thank you.
4024000	4026000	I have a question.
4026000	4028000	Oh my god.
4028000	4030000	The light coming out now
4030000	4032000	has no bias.
4032000	4034000	The bias and phase
4034000	4036000	are all random.
4036000	4038000	Is it possible
4038000	4040000	to hold the gate
4040000	4042000	and make some micro-structures
4042000	4044000	to further control
4044000	4046000	the light's bias
4046000	4048000	or phase?
4048000	4050000	Phase may be more difficult,
4050000	4052000	but if it's bias, it's possible.
4052000	4054000	There are some ways.
4054000	4056000	For example, you can do spin injection.
4056000	4058000	For example, the electrons
4058000	4060000	you inject
4060000	4062000	are more of a spin.
4062000	4064000	For example, a large spin out.
4064000	4066000	If you use
4066000	4068000	this method,
4068000	4070000	if the electrons you inject are all spin out,
4070000	4072000	it will produce a corresponding polarization.
4072000	4074000	It will produce a corresponding original bias.
4074000	4076000	Someone has also
4076000	4078000	done this.
4078000	4080000	Maybe you can add
4080000	4082000	a non-parallel
4082000	4084000	electrode.
4084000	4086000	Using its spin-orbital interaction,
4086000	4088000	you can also use it to
4088000	4090000	rotate the electron's
4090000	4092000	spin direction.
4092000	4094000	You can also use this
4094000	4096000	to control its spin direction.
4096000	4098000	At the same time, you can also change
4098000	4100000	the light's polarization.
4100000	4102000	Okay.
4102000	4104000	What about phase?
4104000	4106000	I think it's
4106000	4108000	more difficult.
4108000	4110000	Okay.
4110000	4112000	Got it.
4112000	4114000	Cool.
4114000	4116000	Thank you.
4116000	4118000	Hello, I have another question.
4118000	4120000	Okay, thank you.
4120000	4122000	I'm sorry.
4122000	4124000	It's a bit like the RLFrequency.
4124000	4126000	There are two pictures.
4126000	4128000	One is
4128000	4130000	the picture with less frequency.
4130000	4132000	The other is
4132000	4134000	the light.
4134000	4136000	Right.
4136000	4138000	There are
4138000	4140000	four peaks
4140000	4142000	in the middle.
4142000	4144000	What is the corresponding
4144000	4146000	polarity of these peaks?
4146000	4148000	This is
4148000	4150000	because
4150000	4152000	when you
4152000	4154000	play RF signal,
4154000	4156000	Is it the polarity of your pulse?
4156000	4158000	Let me explain why.
4158000	4160000	The reason is
4160000	4162000	when you play the pulse,
4162000	4164000	you also produce
4164000	4166000	EM wave.
4166000	4168000	It's like an antenna.
4168000	4170000	It also acts as a radio.
4170000	4172000	These peaks
4172000	4174000	are caused by the interference
4174000	4176000	between the radio and the pulse.
4176000	4178000	I see.
4178000	4180000	Okay.
4180000	4182000	I see.
4182000	4184000	I see.
4184000	4186000	I see.
4186000	4188000	I see.
4188000	4190000	I see.
4190000	4192000	I see.
4192000	4194000	I want to follow up
4194000	4196000	the question of the tab.
4196000	4198000	You said EM wave is produced
4198000	4200000	in this.
4200000	4202000	My question is
4202000	4204000	what is the impact of EM wave in this area?
4204000	4206000	Basically,
4206000	4208000	this is related to
4208000	4210000	the time result measurement I just showed.
4210000	4212000	You can see
4212000	4214000	if EM wave itself can drive
4214000	4216000	this signal,
4216000	4218000	you will see that the signal
4218000	4220000	will produce at the same time
4220000	4222000	because the speed of light
4222000	4224000	is much faster than the speed of the soul.
4224000	4226000	So if there is a signal,
4226000	4228000	you will see that there is a signal
4228000	4230000	in this place.
4230000	4232000	Okay.
4232000	4234000	Basically,
4234000	4236000	this tells you that
4236000	4238000	EM wave itself can't drive
4238000	4240000	this charge transport.
4240000	4242000	It can't drive,
4242000	4244000	so it can't produce light.
4244000	4246000	Only the soul itself
4246000	4248000	and its strength
4248000	4250000	are enough.
4250000	4252000	This is a very good question.
4252000	4254000	So
4254000	4256000	in this experiment,
4256000	4258000	how much control do you have
4258000	4260000	on the resonance frequency
4260000	4262000	of the soul
4262000	4264000	or the amplitude?
4264000	4266000	Does it depend on the material
4266000	4268000	or does it depend on
4268000	4270000	the transducer you designed?
4272000	4274000	Frequency
4274000	4276000	depends on the transducer.
4276000	4278000	Basically, it depends on
4278000	4280000	the quality of the transducer.
4280000	4282000	You can control
4282000	4284000	how narrow the resonance frequency
4284000	4286000	of the soul is.
4286000	4288000	As for the amplitude,
4288000	4290000	it depends on
4290000	4292000	how much power
4292000	4294000	you add to the RF signal.
4294000	4296000	The more power you add,
4296000	4298000	the greater the amplitude.
4298000	4300000	But at the same time,
4300000	4302000	when you add
4302000	4304000	too much power,
4304000	4306000	your sample will heat up.
4306000	4308000	When it heats up,
4308000	4310000	the high temperature
4310000	4312000	for the
4312000	4314000	transport quantized
4314000	4316000	charge state is not a good thing.
4316000	4318000	So
4318000	4320000	you can't really add
4320000	4322000	too much power.
4322000	4324000	At the same time,
4324000	4326000	we don't want it to be too large
4326000	4328000	that it can carry more than
4328000	4330000	one electron.
4330000	4332000	Then it won't produce light.
4333000	4335000	I have another question.
4335000	4337000	It's about the production of components.
4337000	4339000	Yeah.
4339000	4341000	When you're using 10 quantum wells,
4341000	4343000	did you say you're using 10?
4343000	4345000	Yes.
4345000	4347000	Why did you choose
4347000	4349000	10? Because it's not
4349000	4351000	directional, right?
4353000	4355000	Yes, that's right.
4355000	4357000	You mean
4357000	4359000	if it's dry edge,
4359000	4361000	the well
4362000	4364000	will be more...
4364000	4366000	And like it...
4366000	4368000	I didn't try.
4368000	4370000	Theoretically, it should be possible.
4370000	4372000	But I didn't do that.
4372000	4374000	Because I just saw
4374000	4376000	that SM has a lot of residue.
4376000	4378000	Will it cause some
4378000	4380000	gradient decrease or even
4380000	4382000	cause some feedback problems?
4382000	4384000	It's also possible.
4384000	4386000	It just so happens that
4386000	4388000	I didn't do my edge well on this device.
4388000	4390000	So it's a little ugly.
4390000	4392000	I see.
4394000	4396000	Thank you.
4396000	4398000	I have a question.
4398000	4400000	I have a few questions.
4400000	4402000	The first one is,
4402000	4404000	as far as I know,
4404000	4406000	there's a very important thing
4406000	4408000	about producing single photon source.
4408000	4410000	It's the source's dead time.
4410000	4412000	How long can it produce
4412000	4414000	a single photon source?
4414000	4416000	Because this is very related to
4416000	4418000	quantum communication.
4418000	4420000	Even if
4420000	4422000	you do it very well,
4422000	4424000	every time there's a pulse,
4424000	4426000	every time there's a cycle,
4426000	4428000	there's an electron passing through.
4428000	4430000	Then the dead time
4430000	4432000	is about 1 nanosecond.
4437000	4439000	Because your frequency is 1 GHz.
4439000	4441000	My frequency is 1 GHz.
4441000	4443000	Yes.
4443000	4445000	So its dead time is
4445000	4447000	about 1 nanosecond.
4448000	4450000	Is this better than
4450000	4452000	the general single photon source?
4452000	4454000	Or is it worse?
4454000	4456000	Basically,
4456000	4458000	it's about the same as
4458000	4460000	the best single photon source's
4460000	4462000	repetition rate.
4462000	4464000	The best single photon source
4464000	4466000	can produce 1 GHz to 3 GHz.
4466000	4468000	Okay.
4468000	4470000	So this has potential.
4470000	4472000	Yes.
4472000	4474000	The second question is,
4475000	4477000	I want to know how to
4477000	4479000	control the
4479000	4481000	one-time-only electron.
4481000	4483000	So you have to adjust
4483000	4485000	the gate voltage.
4485000	4487000	Is it better to adjust it smaller?
4487000	4489000	Or is it better to reduce
4489000	4491000	the number of electrons?
4491000	4493000	Basically, the less, the better.
4495000	4497000	In a better situation,
4497000	4499000	you want to see quantized current.
4499000	4501000	You want to see
4501000	4503000	when you change
4503000	4505000	the gate voltage,
4505000	4507000	you'll see a quantized
4507000	4509000	quantum.
4509000	4511000	Yes.
4511000	4513000	You'll see a quantum.
4513000	4515000	That corresponds to
4515000	4517000	the one-time-only electron.
4517000	4519000	Okay.
4519000	4521000	If you can see that, it's better.
4521000	4523000	My device is not perfect.
4523000	4525000	I can't see the quantized
4525000	4527000	current quantum.
4527000	4529000	I think that's why
4529000	4531000	my single photon emission
4531000	4533000	has a peak
4533000	4535000	that's not really low.
4537000	4539000	The question is,
4539000	4541000	why can't you add
4541000	4543000	a smaller voltage?
4543000	4545000	Why can't your device
4545000	4547000	lower the voltage?
4549000	4551000	If you lower
4551000	4553000	the electron density,
4553000	4555000	what happens?
4555000	4557000	Can't you see the light?
4557000	4559000	First of all, your signal will be weaker.
4559000	4561000	Yes.
4561000	4563000	So you'll need
4563000	4565000	a longer time
4565000	4567000	to accumulate these signals.
4569000	4571000	I think it's okay.
4571000	4573000	I think it needs to be less.
4577000	4579000	Yes.
4579000	4581000	Theoretically, it's okay.
4581000	4583000	But that means
4583000	4585000	on average,
4585000	4587000	on average,
4587000	4589000	the electron density
4589000	4591000	in the cycle
4591000	4593000	is 1.
4593000	4595000	In that case,
4595000	4597000	first of all,
4597000	4599000	even if
4599000	4601000	your source
4601000	4603000	is a gigahertz frequency,
4603000	4605000	the light you emit
4605000	4607000	won't have
4607000	4609000	light in every cycle.
4609000	4611000	Okay.
4611000	4613000	Yes.
4613000	4615000	That's not
4615000	4617000	the case.
4617000	4619000	And then
4619000	4621000	the brightness will be lower.
4621000	4623000	Yes.
4623000	4625000	I think it's okay.
4625000	4627000	You can still
4627000	4629000	bring less
4629000	4631000	electrons
4631000	4633000	in every cycle.
4633000	4635000	Of course, it will still emit
4635000	4637000	light.
4637000	4639000	So you mean
4639000	4641000	your experiment
4641000	4643000	is basically
4643000	4645000	a one-year experiment.
4645000	4647000	So if you spend
4647000	4649000	a year to do this experiment,
4649000	4651000	the G2 value will be lower.
4651000	4653000	Yes.
4653000	4655000	Theoretically, yes.
4655000	4657000	But...
4657000	4659000	I think
4659000	4661000	theoretically, yes.
4661000	4663000	Okay.
4663000	4665000	But in practice,
4665000	4667000	you won't want to do this.
4667000	4669000	Yes, I understand.
4669000	4671000	The third question is
4671000	4673000	the reason why
4673000	4675000	a single photon source
4675000	4677000	can become a single photon source
4677000	4679000	is because...
4679000	4681000	For example,
4681000	4683000	when an acetone is triggered,
4683000	4685000	it can't trigger the second one
4685000	4687000	because the second one
4687000	4689000	will have a photon blockade problem.
4689000	4691000	The acetone binding energy
4691000	4693000	will be different.
4693000	4695000	What is the mechanism
4695000	4697000	of this device?
4697000	4699000	Your channel is narrow enough
4699000	4701000	to allow
4701000	4703000	only one electron
4703000	4705000	to pass through
4705000	4707000	at a time.
4707000	4709000	This is the basic mechanism.
4709000	4711000	This is very different
4711000	4713000	from the single photon source
4713000	4715000	of a single emitter.
4715000	4717000	Why don't you
4717000	4719000	use a quantum wire
4719000	4721000	to do this experiment?
4721000	4723000	For example, if you use a quantum wire,
4723000	4725000	it will pass through twice.
4725000	4727000	Yes.
4727000	4729000	Do you want to
4729000	4731000	collaborate with a German team?
4731000	4733000	This is a good question.
4733000	4735000	But we...
4735000	4737000	We want to try it
4737000	4739000	in the future.
4739000	4741000	Okay.
4741000	4743000	That's about it. Thank you.
4743000	4745000	Thank you.
4747000	4749000	Do you have any questions?
4749000	4751000	If not,
4751000	4753000	I will turn off
4753000	4755000	the recording.
4757000	4759000	Thank you.
