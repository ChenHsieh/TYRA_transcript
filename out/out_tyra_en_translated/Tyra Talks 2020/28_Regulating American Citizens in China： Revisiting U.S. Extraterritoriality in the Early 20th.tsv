0	2000	Recording has started.
30000	36000	In fact, he was originally a law student at NTU Law School.
36000	41000	He had studied in the Department of Law at Hokkaido University in Japan for a year.
41000	46000	Not only did he complete his law degree, he also obtained a lawyer's license.
46000	50000	He also worked at a large law firm in Taiwan and Japan.
50000	57000	To add to that, Ming-Hsi and I have known each other for a long time.
57000	59000	We were classmates in the same year at NTU Law School.
59000	63000	In our hearts, Ming-Hsi has always been a strong character like a god.
63000	67000	We thought it was difficult for him to study law.
67000	69000	We didn't expect him to be able to study history.
69000	73000	Not only that, he is also the president of NTU's Food & Beverage Association.
73000	77000	To us, he has always been a very strong god.
77000	80000	He also won countless books.
80000	81000	I think it's very impressive.
81000	87000	What's cool about Ming-Hsi is that he always follows a two-way path.
87000	89000	He studies both law and history at the same time.
89000	93000	At the moment, he is in the Department of History at NTU Law School.
93000	96000	He also combined his two-way background with his major.
96000	100000	His field of research includes modern international law history,
100000	102000	East Asian legal modernization,
102000	103000	Sino-US relations history,
103000	107000	international economic law and tax law, and so on.
107000	112000	I was thinking about today's topic, foreign law.
112000	117000	For many people, foreign law is a familiar and uncertain concept.
117000	123000	So let's talk about the rules of today's speech.
123000	126000	Today's speech is actually quite simple.
126000	129000	If you have any questions,
129000	136000	you can either turn on your microphone and ask the speaker directly.
136000	139000	Ming-Hsi likes this kind of interactive speech mode.
139000	144000	Or if you are shy or worried about affecting the speaker's flow,
144000	148000	you can also post your questions in the chat area.
148000	152000	I will find the right time to ask.
152000	156000	After Ming-Hsi finishes his speech,
156000	158000	we will also have a Q&A session.
158000	161000	If everyone is okay,
161000	163000	let's welcome Ming-Hsi.
170000	173000	Hello, everyone.
173000	175000	Can you see my PowerPoint?
175000	178000	Okay.
178000	182000	Thank you for your introduction.
182000	183000	As Yi-An said,
183000	185000	we are both university classmates.
185000	187000	But in the legal department of NTU,
187000	190000	I think Yi-An and I are quite different.
190000	196000	Yi-An left the legal department to study psychology
196000	198000	and became a lawyer.
198000	202000	I am honored to have Yi-An as my host.
202000	204000	Today's topic is
204000	208000	controlling US citizens in China.
208000	211000	This is my research plan for the first-year students
211000	214000	in the history department of NTU.
214000	217000	This plan is still in the early stages,
217000	220000	so I would like to share it with you.
220000	224000	I found that in this project,
224000	226000	there are fewer liberal arts students.
226000	228000	So I will spend a little more time
228000	230000	to introduce to you
230000	232000	the current situation of humanities
232000	239000	and legal studies in the US.
239000	242000	So today's speech will be divided into several parts.
242000	243000	One is self-introduction.
243000	245000	But I don't think I need to introduce too much,
245000	247000	because Yi-An has given me a very detailed explanation.
247000	250000	The second part is to share with you
250000	251000	what history is.
251000	254000	This is actually a common question for everyone.
254000	256000	And I am often asked by teachers
256000	259000	in different departments or classmates.
259000	260000	Because history is abstract.
260000	263000	We can say that what happened in the past is history.
263000	265000	There are so many things in history.
265000	269000	As a historian or a doctoral student in history,
269000	271000	how do we choose the topic?
271000	272000	How do we do research?
272000	274000	In other words, what are the doctoral students
274000	276000	in the history department doing?
276000	279000	Why do I want to study legal history?
279000	281000	What is the relationship between law and history?
281000	283000	In particular, why do I want to choose the topic
283000	285000	of international law as my research topic?
285000	288000	After the introduction of these major subjects
288000	289000	and the background,
289000	292000	I will talk about my initial research in the first year.
292000	296000	That is, what is the foreign law in the United States?
296000	298000	In the past, in high school textbooks,
298000	300000	we often heard that foreign law
300000	302000	is a part of an unequal treaty.
302000	305000	In the past, our country or China
305000	308000	suffered a lot of unequal treatment.
308000	310000	Then it was a matter of losing power.
310000	311000	Is it true? Is it true?
311000	313000	Did the United States benefit from this?
313000	314000	Who benefited from this?
314000	317000	The first research in the history department
317000	321000	is to clarify some facts and some institutional backgrounds.
321000	325000	The higher level is to develop theories.
325000	328000	So in the end, I want to talk about my future plan.
328000	331000	How do I develop these facts and their theoretical meanings
331000	334000	and then carry out my future research?
334000	336000	So here, actually,
336000	337000	Yi-An has already introduced it to me.
337000	338000	I'm not drunk.
338000	340000	I want to talk about the last point.
340000	343000	That is, why do I want to study history?
343000	346000	In fact, my initial goal was
346000	350000	to teach in a law school in the United States.
350000	352000	Here, I think there is something very interesting
352000	354000	that I can share with you.
354000	356000	In the United States, professional schools,
356000	359000	such as law schools,
359000	362000	their practice is very different from
362000	367000	what we usually do in history, physics, or math.
367000	370000	As a historian, I will tell you
370000	376000	what the origin and evolution of this system is.
376000	377000	As you know,
377000	380000	in the world of legal education,
380000	382000	North America is very special.
382000	386000	They do not have legal education in the university.
386000	388000	Unlike in Taiwan, Japan, Germany,
388000	390000	the United Kingdom, or France,
390000	392000	we can choose the law department
392000	394000	after graduating from high school.
394000	396000	After graduating from the law department,
396000	398000	you can take a law exam.
398000	401000	Then you can become a lawyer
401000	403000	or continue to study for a master's degree
403000	405000	and return to the law department to teach.
405000	408000	This is not the case in the United States and Canada.
408000	411000	The U.S. Department of State does not have a law department.
411000	414000	You have to graduate from the Department of State
414000	417000	before you can get your first law degree,
417000	420000	which is called JD, or Juris Doctor.
420000	421000	It's the same as MD.
421000	423000	It has the title of a doctor,
423000	427000	but it's not a Ph.D. doctor.
427000	428000	So traditionally,
428000	430000	when there was a law school in the United States,
430000	432000	they thought that
432000	434000	law was a skill,
434000	437000	not a subject.
437000	438000	So in the 19th century,
438000	440000	the teachers of the law school
440000	442000	were some senior lawyers,
442000	445000	judges, or food workers.
445000	446000	And the education of the law school
446000	448000	was to have these food workers
448000	451000	tell you how to become a good lawyer.
451000	453000	So the course of the law school
453000	455000	was very food-oriented.
455000	457000	It taught you how to sign a contract,
457000	461000	how to act or defend in front of the jury,
461000	463000	how to interact and interrogate,
463000	466000	how to get along with the judge,
466000	470000	and so on and so forth.
470000	472000	Later, everyone thought
472000	473000	that if you teach at school,
473000	476000	you still need to have a little bit of academic knowledge.
476000	480000	But there was no such thing as a law Ph.D.
480000	482000	So what should you do?
482000	483000	There is still a method
483000	485000	taught at law schools in the United States
485000	488000	called traditional track,
488000	491000	which allows you to become a teacher of the law school.
491000	493000	What is traditional track?
493000	496000	It's when you graduate from college
496000	498000	and become a JD,
498000	499000	your first law degree.
499000	500000	After that,
500000	503000	you become a lawyer for three years
503000	505000	or a judge assistant for three years
505000	508000	to gain food experience.
508000	510000	After gaining food experience,
510000	512000	you go to the law department of the university
512000	517000	to apply for the position of teacher.
517000	519000	When you're a teacher,
519000	520000	it's usually three years.
520000	521000	You have to teach on the side.
521000	523000	What you teach is to teach some legal writing,
523000	525000	mathematical writing, and so on.
525000	527000	These are related to food.
527000	528000	During the three years you teach,
528000	531000	you have to write a master's thesis.
531000	534000	If this master's thesis is well written,
534000	536000	you can go to various schools
536000	539000	and apply for the position of assistant professor.
539000	540000	Once you become an assistant professor,
540000	542000	you'll be like other departments.
542000	543000	You'll start writing thesis,
543000	546000	升等,教書, and so on.
546000	547000	But later,
547000	549000	in the 1970s or 1980s,
549000	551000	we found that
551000	554000	the failure of being a fellow
554000	556000	and not becoming an assistant professor
556000	557000	is very high.
557000	558000	This can also be seen.
558000	559000	In JD for three years,
559000	561000	you're learning how to write a book,
561000	563000	and then you become a lawyer for three years.
564000	565000	It doesn't make sense.
565000	567000	When you go back to law school,
567000	569000	you suddenly start writing a thesis.
569000	570000	Like everyone here,
570000	571000	we all study Ph.D.
571000	572000	We all know that
572000	575000	writing a thesis requires a lot of practice,
575000	577000	and then you need someone to lead.
577000	581000	You need a lot of research methods, and so on.
581000	582000	So later, the U.S. Law School
582000	585000	came up with a new way
585000	586000	to make you a teacher,
586000	590000	which is the so-called JD Ph.D. double degree.
590000	591000	In other words,
591000	594000	you get a Ph.D. in another field,
594000	597000	such as history, economics,
597000	600000	politics, language,
600000	602000	psychology, and so on.
602000	604000	Then you go to JD,
604000	606000	and then you become a lawyer for two years.
606000	607000	At this point, you don't have to be a fellow,
607000	610000	and you can take your Ph.D. thesis
610000	613000	and apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.
613000	614000	Basically,
614000	616000	all the new professors at the U.S. Law School
616000	620000	are JD Ph.D. double degrees.
621000	623000	This is my original goal.
623000	626000	I want to get a Ph.D. in history first,
626000	628000	and then I want to get a Ph.D. in JD.
628000	631000	Then I can apply for a job at the U.S. Law School.
631000	634000	There are more and more Chinese people
634000	636000	applying for a Ph.D. degree
636000	637000	at the U.S. Law School
637000	639000	through this kind of double degree.
639000	640000	But as far as I know,
640000	642000	no one in Taiwan
642000	643000	has applied for a Ph.D. degree
643000	645000	at the U.S. Law School in this way.
645000	647000	So I want to give it a try.
647000	649000	Next,
649000	650000	in the past,
650000	652000	most of the Ph.D. and JD degrees
652000	654000	were obtained at different schools.
654000	655000	For example,
655000	656000	Professor Ian Ayers,
656000	657000	who is very famous for
657000	658000	doing legal economic analysis
658000	659000	at Yale University.
659000	662000	He was MIT's Econ Ph.D.,
662000	663000	plus Yale's JD,
663000	666000	and then he taught at Yale.
666000	668000	For people in mainland China,
668000	669000	for example,
669000	672000	Professor Li Ji at UC Irvine,
672000	674000	he was a political science Ph.D.
674000	675000	at Northwestern University,
675000	676000	plus Yale's JD,
676000	680000	and then he taught law at UC Irvine.
680000	682000	So this is what I want to challenge.
682000	684000	I want to practice and hone my knowledge
684000	685000	in the history department,
685000	686000	learn the methods of history,
686000	688000	and write papers.
688000	689000	Later on,
689000	690000	in the last stage of my Ph.D. program,
690000	693000	in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year,
693000	694000	I applied for a Ph.D. degree
694000	696000	at another school.
696000	698000	I was a lawyer in the U.S. for two years,
698000	700000	and then I taught at a law school.
700000	702000	This is a brief explanation
702000	703000	of why I want to
703000	705000	apply for a Ph.D. degree in history.
705000	706000	On the one hand,
706000	709000	I always have this idea of cross-field.
709000	711000	I think this kind of training and environment in the U.S.
711000	714000	is the best fit for my research.
716000	718000	The last thing I want to add is that
718000	719000	I just said that
719000	721000	Taiwanese have not yet read Ph.D. and JD,
721000	722000	right?
722000	725000	The next question must be
725000	727000	that in Taiwan's law department,
727000	729000	there are many legal scholars
729000	732000	who claim to have obtained a Ph.D. degree in the U.S.
732000	734000	What kind of degree did they read?
734000	736000	What kind of career path did they embark on?
736000	737000	Since they are different from Americans
737000	739000	who cultivate law schools,
739000	742000	they must have a different set of things, right?
742000	745000	So I wrote LLM and JSD here later.
745000	747000	Here I would like to explain to you
747000	750000	what this is.
750000	751000	LLM is generally translated as
751000	753000	a legal master's degree.
753000	755000	It is a Latin abbreviation.
755000	761000	It means that
761000	763000	if you are not in the U.S. today,
763000	765000	for example, the U.K., France,
765000	767000	Taiwan, or Japan,
767000	769000	you have already studied law in college.
769000	771000	So it is an abbreviation
771000	773000	for a legal master's degree
773000	775000	for foreigners.
775000	777000	This is called LLM.
777000	780000	You only need to study for nine months
780000	782000	without writing a paper.
782000	785000	Then you can be qualified
785000	787000	to be a lawyer in New York.
787000	789000	So in most cases,
789000	791000	in general, in Taiwan or Japan,
791000	793000	if you have been a lawyer for three or five years
793000	794000	and you think you need to retire,
794000	795000	you can go to the U.S.
795000	798000	and study for nine months.
798000	799000	Among these LLM students,
799000	802000	some may be interested in academics.
802000	805000	So you can find a professor
805000	807000	who is willing to teach you
807000	809000	while you are studying LLM.
809000	811000	Then you can enroll
811000	812000	and become a JSD,
812000	814000	which we generally call
814000	816000	a legal master's degree.
816000	818000	This JSD is actually very different
818000	820000	from our general Ph.D.
820000	821000	Because once you enroll,
821000	822000	you are a doctoral candidate.
822000	823000	So you don't need to take classes,
823000	824000	you don't need to be a teacher,
824000	825000	you don't need to be a lecturer.
825000	827000	In principle, if you write a paper,
827000	829000	you can graduate after the exam.
829000	830000	So there are some very famous
830000	831000	LLM teachers in China.
831000	834000	They may only study JSD for a year and a half
834000	835000	or two years
835000	836000	before they graduate.
836000	837000	There are a lot of people like this.
837000	839000	Because JSD is not like
839000	840000	our Ph.D. training,
840000	841000	you have to take classes,
841000	842000	take exams,
842000	843000	be a lecturer,
843000	845000	teach, and so on.
845000	847000	So the problem with a JSD graduate
847000	848000	is that
848000	850000	their quality is not very certain.
851000	852000	Some people are JSD,
852000	854000	their boss has very high requirements for them,
854000	855000	asking them to continue to take classes,
855000	857000	continue to study methods,
857000	859000	or take the qualification exam with them.
859000	861000	Or some students are very smart.
861000	862000	I have a lot of JSD teachers
862000	864000	in the Department of Law in Canada.
864000	865000	They are very smart.
865000	867000	They watch the lecturers
867000	868000	have a seminar in the law school every day,
868000	869000	and they will kill each other.
869000	871000	They watch Huashan's paper every day
871000	873000	and become a big family.
874000	877000	After they return to China,
877000	879000	they can be a Ph.D.
879000	880000	and teach law in Taiwan.
880000	882000	But in the US Department of Law,
882000	884000	you can hardly see any teachers
884000	885000	who are JSD.
885000	886000	Because they are
886000	888000	Ph.D. for foreigners.
888000	890000	This is a brief introduction.
890000	893000	I used to think that
893000	895000	if I went to the US to study law,
895000	897000	I could just study LLM and JSD.
897000	898000	But I thought,
898000	899000	no,
899000	900000	I want to try to
900000	901000	receive the same training as Americans.
901000	903000	If Americans want to become a professor of law,
903000	905000	I will become a professor of law.
905000	907000	So I started with Ph.D.
907000	908000	Later,
908000	909000	in my senior year,
909000	911000	I will see if I can get a J.D.
911000	912000	and try to find a job
912000	914000	in the US Department of Law.
917000	919000	Next, I will answer a question.
919000	921000	What is history?
921000	922000	I am often asked this question.
922000	924000	But I think this is a disaster question.
924000	925000	It's like I want to ask,
925000	927000	what is physics?
927000	929000	What is math?
929000	931000	It is difficult to define a subject.
931000	933000	But I think I can try
933000	935000	to look at this subject
935000	937000	from a more specific perspective.
937000	939000	What is it?
939000	941000	I think from the perspective of abstract theory,
941000	943000	in the Western context,
943000	948000	history is also a method of philosophy.
948000	949000	In other words,
949000	950000	the research we do in history
950000	952000	is the same as asking a question,
952000	954000	giving it a false hypothesis,
954000	957000	and then verifying it, right?
957000	962000	It is the same as philosophy, physics, and chemistry.
962000	964000	We need to ask a question,
964000	967000	and then use some methods to answer it,
967000	971000	to verify if your hypothesis is correct.
971000	973000	Of course, this is a bit of nonsense.
973000	975000	Because anyone who studies Ph.D.
975000	977000	has to do this kind of study.
977000	979000	So I think we can look at history
979000	981000	from a different perspective.
981000	985000	Whether it is Greece or China,
985000	987000	people in ancient times
987000	989000	have a cycle of history.
989000	991000	By cycle of history,
991000	993000	I mean that
993000	995000	for them,
995000	997000	history is something that
997000	999000	happens over and over again.
999000	1001000	For example,
1001000	1003000	in the Tang Dynasty,
1003000	1005000	Emperor Taizong said that
1005000	1007000	history is the key to understanding the mind.
1007000	1009000	In other words,
1009000	1011000	as long as you study the past,
1011000	1013000	you will learn some lessons.
1014000	1016000	By cycle of history,
1016000	1018000	I mean that
1018000	1020000	there is nothing new under the sun.
1020000	1022000	So I understand the past,
1022000	1024000	and I understand the future.
1024000	1026000	Because what happened in the past
1026000	1028000	will keep happening over and over again.
1028000	1030000	So as long as I know the past,
1030000	1032000	I will know how to face the same thing in the future.
1032000	1034000	What should I do when it happens again?
1034000	1036000	But as we all know,
1036000	1038000	this is a kind of fantasy.
1038000	1040000	How is it possible that
1040000	1042000	people 200 years ago
1042000	1044000	would face the same problems
1044000	1046000	as we do now?
1046000	1048000	Of course, it is different.
1048000	1050000	In the 18th and 19th centuries,
1050000	1052000	history was taken over by the state.
1052000	1054000	There was a very
1054000	1056000	purposeful approach
1056000	1058000	to help
1058000	1060000	build a democratic country.
1060000	1062000	For example,
1062000	1064000	when Germany was about to be unified,
1064000	1066000	a group of historians came out
1066000	1068000	and wrote history of Germany.
1068000	1070000	They told us that we were different
1070000	1072000	from the Italians.
1072000	1074000	We have a glorious history.
1074000	1076000	Who is German?
1076000	1078000	We have a common memory.
1078000	1080000	This also happened
1080000	1082000	in the end of the Qing Dynasty
1082000	1084000	and the beginning of the Republic of China.
1084000	1086000	Chinese historians told you
1086000	1088000	that we are all descendants of the Yan Emperor.
1088000	1090000	So we have a common ancestor.
1090000	1092000	We must agree that we are all Chinese.
1092000	1094000	So for a while,
1094000	1096000	history was used by the state
1096000	1098000	to build the common memory of the nation.
1100000	1102000	In the 19th century,
1102000	1104000	there was another trend.
1104000	1106000	Social science,
1106000	1108000	political science,
1108000	1110000	and other social sciences
1110000	1112000	wanted to become
1112000	1114000	like natural science
1114000	1116000	and discover the common principles
1116000	1118000	of human society.
1118000	1120000	They wanted to analyze
1120000	1122000	why the French Revolution happened,
1122000	1124000	what its causal relationship was,
1124000	1126000	and what its social background conditions were.
1126000	1128000	If we can build
1128000	1130000	a abstract theory
1130000	1132000	that the French Revolution
1132000	1134000	will happen
1134000	1136000	when the four conditions
1136000	1138000	are met,
1138000	1140000	we can predict
1140000	1142000	when the next revolution will happen
1142000	1144000	or prevent it from happening.
1144000	1146000	Another famous example
1146000	1148000	is Marx.
1148000	1150000	He said that human history
1150000	1152000	has a process.
1152000	1154000	We will go from feudalism
1154000	1156000	to a small class revolution
1156000	1158000	to a large class revolution.
1158000	1160000	Many historians' work
1160000	1162000	is to prove
1162000	1164000	the theory of social science
1164000	1166000	and the process
1166000	1168000	of social science principles.
1168000	1170000	Until now,
1170000	1172000	many historians in mainland China
1172000	1174000	are still trying to prove
1174000	1176000	the process of Marxism
1176000	1178000	in China.
1178000	1180000	This is the purpose
1180000	1182000	of the third kind of history.
1182000	1184000	The fourth kind of history
1184000	1186000	is similar to the second kind of history,
1186000	1188000	but it starts to ask smaller questions.
1188000	1190000	Historians want to
1190000	1192000	understand the history of the past
1192000	1194000	and develop quantitative studies
1194000	1196000	of economics or politics.
1198000	1200000	The most famous example
1200000	1202000	is Professor Daniel Clerman
1202000	1204000	at the University of South Carolina.
1204000	1206000	He taught at the University of Chicago
1206000	1208000	because his wife was a lawyer
1208000	1210000	who was afraid of the cold.
1210000	1212000	His family moved to South Carolina.
1212000	1214000	He is a history doctor
1214000	1216000	and a law professor
1216000	1218000	at the University of Chicago.
1218000	1220000	His research is very interesting.
1220000	1222000	He uses the documents
1222000	1224000	and information
1224000	1226000	he discovered
1226000	1228000	in history training
1228000	1230000	and his strong
1230000	1232000	statistical and quantitative background
1232000	1234000	to do some
1234000	1236000	theoretical practical research.
1236000	1238000	Some questions
1238000	1240000	are difficult to answer.
1240000	1242000	Does judicial independence
1242000	1244000	help economic development?
1244000	1246000	We are not like natural science,
1246000	1248000	which can control all variables
1248000	1250000	in the laboratory.
1250000	1252000	When we want to study this topic,
1252000	1254000	we have to do some social experiment
1254000	1256000	to do the cause-and-effect theory,
1256000	1258000	and we need to find
1258000	1260000	a lot of agent variables.
1260000	1262000	Every time a country
1262000	1264000	does judicial independence reform,
1264000	1266000	it often follows
1266000	1268000	many other reforms at the same time.
1268000	1270000	This is the best way
1270000	1272000	to understand the relationship
1272000	1274000	between judicial independence
1274000	1276000	and economic development in the UK.
1276000	1278000	Professor Dan Clearman
1278000	1280000	has some very good information.
1280000	1282000	For example,
1282000	1284000	he found that
1284000	1286000	in the 18th and 19th centuries,
1286000	1288000	the UK was doing judicial independence reform.
1288000	1290000	At the same time,
1290000	1292000	East India Company
1292000	1294000	was listed
1294000	1296000	in London Stock Exchange
1296000	1298000	because
1298000	1300000	there was no
1300000	1302000	good information transmission system.
1302000	1304000	Therefore, news from London
1304000	1306000	had to wait three or five days
1306000	1308000	before it could be sent to Amsterdam.
1308000	1310000	He thought
1310000	1312000	that the agent variables
1312000	1314000	of economic development
1314000	1316000	were the high and low prices
1316000	1318000	of East India Company's shares.
1318000	1320000	Whenever a judicial independence
1320000	1322000	law or reform
1322000	1324000	occurred in the UK,
1324000	1326000	East India Company's shares
1326000	1328000	would rise or fall
1328000	1330000	when the news
1330000	1332000	was sent to Amsterdam.
1332000	1334000	He used statistics
1334000	1336000	to infer the situation in the UK.
1336000	1338000	In the end,
1338000	1340000	he concluded that
1340000	1342000	every judicial independence reform
1342000	1344000	in the UK
1344000	1346000	had something to do
1346000	1348000	with the rise of
1348000	1350000	East India Company's shares.
1350000	1352000	Without historical training,
1352000	1354000	East India Company's shares
1354000	1356000	would not have risen.
1356000	1358000	This is another theory.
1358000	1360000	In the early years,
1360000	1362000	there was a theory
1362000	1364000	that asked
1364000	1366000	why there was
1366000	1368000	no China in the West.
1368000	1370000	In the early years,
1370000	1372000	historians liked to ask
1372000	1374000	why there was no capitalism in China,
1374000	1376000	why there was no scientific revolution in China,
1376000	1378000	and why there was no
1378000	1380000	revolution in China.
1380000	1382000	The next theory is
1382000	1384000	very popular recently,
1384000	1386000	but it is a bit similar
1386000	1388000	to the idea of a national state.
1388000	1390000	Historians believe that
1390000	1392000	the people's historical memory
1392000	1394000	should not serve the country.
1394000	1396000	Therefore,
1396000	1398000	historians began to write
1398000	1400000	some important historical memories.
1400000	1402000	For example,
1402000	1404000	transitional justice should tell you
1404000	1406000	that the Nazi massacre
1406000	1408000	against the Jews
1408000	1410000	was really horrible.
1410000	1412000	We should remember this
1412000	1414000	forever.
1414000	1416000	Because it happened once,
1416000	1418000	it may happen again.
1418000	1420000	The main consciousness of Taiwan
1420000	1422000	must be awakened,
1422000	1424000	because the people of Taiwan
1424000	1426000	have been oppressed for the past 400 years.
1426000	1428000	These popular historical writings
1428000	1430000	are actually shaping historical memory.
1430000	1432000	Another group of people
1432000	1434000	believe that
1434000	1436000	history should not serve the country,
1436000	1438000	so there are a lot of historical studies
1438000	1440000	to deconstruct the national state.
1440000	1442000	For example,
1442000	1444000	tradition is invented,
1444000	1446000	and tradition does not have
1446000	1448000	a long history of 5,000 years.
1448000	1450000	The so-called descendants of the King of Japan
1450000	1452000	only appeared for 100 years.
1452000	1454000	The so-called Japanese cuisine
1454000	1456000	was invented after the Ming Dynasty.
1456000	1458000	In the Middle Ages,
1458000	1460000	the Emperor of Japan believed in Buddhism,
1460000	1462000	so he told everyone not to eat meat.
1462000	1464000	In ancient East Asia,
1464000	1466000	there were four categories of animals
1466000	1468000	in the world,
1468000	1470000	such as grass fish and birds.
1470000	1472000	At that time,
1472000	1474000	the Emperor of Japan said
1474000	1476000	that everyone was not allowed to eat meat,
1476000	1478000	grass fish and birds.
1478000	1480000	In fact,
1480000	1482000	before the Ming Dynasty,
1482000	1484000	the Japanese did not eat beef or pork,
1484000	1486000	so the so-called barbecue and fried pork chops
1486000	1488000	were far-fetched Japanese cuisine.
1488000	1490000	They appeared in the late 19th century
1490000	1492000	and even in the early 20th century.
1493000	1495000	Finally, I think history
1495000	1497000	is different from everyone else.
1497000	1499000	In politics and sociology,
1499000	1501000	they ask more objective questions,
1501000	1503000	but in history,
1503000	1505000	they also ask subjective questions.
1505000	1507000	Traditional sociology
1507000	1509000	may ask a question,
1509000	1511000	such as
1511000	1513000	whether the exam system
1513000	1515000	has promoted social movement.
1515000	1517000	So some historical sociologists
1517000	1519000	will look for a lot of past history
1519000	1521000	to see if there are some
1521000	1523000	poor and hard-working people
1523000	1525000	who became good officials
1525000	1527000	because of the imperial examination,
1527000	1529000	and then flew to Tengda
1529000	1531000	and became famous
1531000	1533000	from the Han dynasty.
1533000	1535000	But historical sociology
1535000	1537000	will ask a question.
1537000	1539000	Objectively,
1539000	1541000	even if the imperial examination
1541000	1543000	really promoted social movement,
1543000	1545000	did the people at that time
1545000	1547000	really realize that
1547000	1549000	the imperial examination
1549000	1551000	promoted social movement?
1551000	1553000	In the Han dynasty,
1553000	1555000	there were some economic works.
1555000	1557000	We can find out from economics
1557000	1559000	what is the meaning of
1559000	1561000	Chou Chou's The Theory of Economics?
1561000	1563000	What does it mean in economics?
1563000	1565000	But historians may ask
1565000	1567000	a person who has not studied
1567000	1569000	modern economics,
1569000	1571000	has not studied Adam Smith,
1571000	1573000	or has not studied economics
1573000	1575000	in NTU,
1575000	1577000	how can he write The Theory of Economics?
1577000	1579000	I think this is the difference
1579000	1581000	between historical sociology
1581000	1583000	and other subjects.
1583000	1585000	The next question is
1585000	1587000	what is legal history?
1587000	1589000	Why is legal history
1589000	1591000	a field worth studying
1591000	1593000	for me?
1593000	1595000	The first argument is,
1595000	1597000	of course,
1597000	1599000	all the legal experts in the court
1599000	1601000	are historians,
1601000	1603000	because the court can only
1603000	1605000	judge what has happened.
1605000	1607000	I am going to discuss
1607000	1609000	whether Su Jianhe killed someone
1609000	1611000	in the past or not.
1611000	1613000	Is he guilty or not?
1613000	1615000	We can only discuss
1615000	1617000	whether he killed someone in the past.
1617000	1619000	The court cannot decide
1619000	1621000	whether he will kill someone in the future.
1621000	1623000	This is a matter of fact.
1623000	1625000	The court can only deal with
1625000	1627000	what has happened.
1627000	1629000	From the legal point of view,
1629000	1631000	when we make a judgment,
1631000	1633000	the court will always
1633000	1635000	make a judgment.
1635000	1637000	In the tradition of British and American law,
1637000	1639000	there are many cases
1639000	1641000	that are not in the text,
1641000	1643000	so you have to tell everyone
1643000	1645000	whether the case in front of you
1645000	1647000	is the same as the case in the past.
1647000	1649000	If it is the same,
1649000	1651000	you should apply the same law.
1651000	1653000	If it is different,
1653000	1655000	you should make another explanation.
1655000	1657000	There are some famous cases
1657000	1659000	where, for example,
1659000	1661000	a court said that
1661000	1663000	A car must pay
1663000	1665000	$10,000.
1665000	1667000	Later,
1667000	1669000	a new case came out
1669000	1671000	where
1671000	1673000	A was hit by B car.
1673000	1675000	Then
1675000	1677000	A told the court
1677000	1679000	that the driver of B car
1679000	1681000	should pay me $10,000.
1681000	1683000	But the lawyer of B car said
1683000	1685000	no, no, no,
1685000	1687000	our case is different from A car.
1687000	1689000	Because A car is black
1689000	1691000	and B car is red.
1691000	1693000	Because humans are more alert
1693000	1695000	when they see a red car.
1695000	1697000	So
1697000	1699000	when they are hit,
1699000	1701000	they have to take more responsibility
1701000	1703000	because they see a red car.
1703000	1705000	British and American law
1705000	1707000	has been debating this kind of thing,
1707000	1709000	so you have to keep looking at
1709000	1711000	the past cases
1711000	1713000	as they are now.
1713000	1715000	Then you need a lot of
1715000	1717000	historical training
1718000	1720000	The second thing is that
1720000	1722000	there is a saying in English
1722000	1724000	that the past is like a foreign country.
1724000	1726000	So when we study
1726000	1728000	the history of law,
1728000	1730000	it's like we are studying
1730000	1732000	another country.
1732000	1734000	So it's like we are now in Taiwan,
1734000	1736000	we are going to legislate.
1736000	1738000	We will refer to what the Japanese do,
1738000	1740000	what the Germans do,
1740000	1742000	what the Americans do.
1742000	1744000	Because these comparisons
1744000	1746000	can give you some ideas.
1746000	1748000	But if you refer to other countries,
1748000	1750000	you will be surprised.
1750000	1752000	Because from a psychological point of view,
1752000	1754000	people all have this
1754000	1756000	in-domain effect.
1756000	1758000	It's not good to play big
1758000	1760000	in front of the case.
1760000	1762000	But you will think
1762000	1764000	what you have is the best.
1764000	1766000	But sometimes when you look at
1766000	1768000	foreign things,
1768000	1770000	you will know that
1770000	1772000	there are many different ways
1772000	1774000	in this world.
1774000	1776000	For example, if I want to control
1776000	1778000	cigarettes,
1778000	1780000	can I refer to
1780000	1782000	how people controlled
1782000	1784000	opium in the past?
1784000	1786000	Of course, opium and cigarettes
1786000	1788000	are different things.
1788000	1790000	But you can think about
1790000	1792000	some new ideas.
1792000	1794000	The second thing is that
1794000	1796000	we all know that
1796000	1798000	humans have a path to rely on.
1798000	1800000	There is one thing that people
1800000	1802000	have been doing for a long time,
1802000	1804000	and the legal history
1804000	1806000	can help you understand
1806000	1808000	the background of this system
1808000	1810000	and its reasons.
1810000	1812000	What did people think at that time?
1812000	1814000	After understanding the reason for
1814000	1816000	the path to rely on,
1816000	1818000	we should now verify that
1818000	1820000	this condition no longer exists
1820000	1822000	or the condition has changed,
1822000	1824000	which means that
1824000	1826000	we should do something different.
1826000	1828000	For example,
1828000	1830000	in the debate on same-sex marriage,
1830000	1832000	it is said that two people
1832000	1834000	of the same sex can get married.
1834000	1836000	If not, why?
1836000	1838000	If there is, why?
1838000	1840000	Has it really changed now?
1840000	1842000	Another common legal history
1842000	1844000	is the debate on
1844000	1846000	the structure of mainstream.
1846000	1848000	For example, we used to think
1848000	1850000	that Hitler's Nazi was terrible
1850000	1852000	because he killed Jews.
1852000	1854000	He set up a prison court
1854000	1856000	and let the judge judge
1856000	1858000	that homosexuals and Jews
1858000	1860000	are inferior species
1860000	1862000	and are not suitable for having children.
1862000	1864000	On the other hand,
1864000	1866000	the United States
1866000	1868000	is a free and democratic defender.
1868000	1870000	Through World War II,
1870000	1872000	the United States
1872000	1874000	liberated
1874000	1876000	these oppressed people.
1876000	1878000	James Whitman,
1878000	1880000	a professor at Yale University,
1880000	1882000	is also a doctor of history.
1882000	1884000	He wrote a book
1884000	1886000	called Hitler's American Model.
1886000	1888000	He said that
1888000	1890000	Hitler's
1890000	1892000	racial discrimination law
1892000	1894000	was widely referred to
1894000	1896000	in the United States
1896000	1898000	as the law of racial discrimination
1898000	1900000	that oppresses black people.
1900000	1902000	In fact, Hitler once said
1902000	1904000	that Americans were too fierce to black people.
1904000	1906000	We can't be so fierce.
1906000	1908000	So, how did Hitler
1908000	1910000	know how to use the law
1910000	1912000	to oppress minorities?
1912000	1914000	It came from the United States.
1914000	1916000	This is what I am doing now.
1916000	1918000	I am using the third world approach
1918000	1920000	to look at the international law.
1920000	1922000	In the past,
1922000	1924000	we thought that the international law
1924000	1926000	was a principle of equal interaction
1926000	1928000	between sovereign states.
1928000	1930000	But in fact, it was not.
1930000	1932000	We know that the international law
1932000	1934000	was once used to oppress
1934000	1936000	and to colonize.
1936000	1938000	The Third World Approach
1938000	1940000	to International Law
1940000	1942000	has a group of scholars.
1942000	1944000	Their goal is to tell you
1944000	1946000	how the international law
1946000	1948000	from the European international law
1948000	1950000	to the international law of the world
1950000	1952000	has contributed a lot to China,
1952000	1954000	Japan, Latin America, etc.
1954000	1956000	They want to tell you
1956000	1958000	that the international law
1958000	1960000	is a tool of oppression.
1960000	1962000	We should not allow the international law
1962000	1964000	to become a tool of oppression again.
1964000	1966000	We must preserve these historical memories.
1966000	1968000	This is what I think
1968000	1970000	the legal history is doing.
1970000	1972000	Before I share my research,
1972000	1974000	I would like to know
1974000	1976000	if you have any questions.
1976000	1978000	I can answer first.
1978000	1980000	I would like to know
1980000	1982000	what is the general history
1982000	1984000	and what is the legal history.
1986000	1988000	I think I have learned a lot.
1988000	1990000	Even if I am a lawyer,
1990000	1992000	I think I have learned a lot.
1996000	1998000	Should I continue?
1998000	2000000	It seems that
2000000	2002000	everyone is still digesting.
2002000	2004000	The information is a bit large.
2004000	2006000	I will try to speak in plain language.
2006000	2008000	I don't know if
2008000	2010000	everyone can understand.
2012000	2014000	I think I have made it clear.
2014000	2016000	I have heard a lot of concepts
2016000	2018000	for the first time.
2018000	2020000	I am not sure
2020000	2022000	but you have made it clear today.
2022000	2024000	The language is very good.
2024000	2026000	I think it has helped me
2026000	2028000	to digest so much information.
2030000	2032000	Can you hear me?
2032000	2034000	Yes.
2034000	2036000	I have a question.
2036000	2038000	I am curious
2038000	2040000	about the background
2040000	2042000	you set up
2042000	2044000	in the beginning.
2044000	2046000	What is history?
2046000	2048000	The front part
2048000	2050000	and the back part
2050000	2052000	are there any differences in views?
2052000	2054000	If so,
2054000	2056000	what do you think?
2058000	2060000	Today's speech
2060000	2062000	is mainly to
2062000	2064000	deconstruct nationalism.
2064000	2066000	In the past, foreign law
2066000	2068000	was described as
2068000	2070000	a symbol of
2070000	2072000	a third world people,
2072000	2074000	Chinese, Japanese,
2074000	2076000	or non-Western people
2076000	2078000	being oppressed.
2078000	2080000	But I will tell you
2080000	2082000	that the actual operation
2082000	2084000	of this theory
2084000	2086000	is based on two things.
2086000	2088000	The first is that
2088000	2090000	I want to improve
2090000	2092000	the meaning of the theory.
2094000	2096000	In the future,
2096000	2098000	I may want to
2098000	2100000	use other methods
2100000	2102000	of political,
2102000	2104000	economic,
2104000	2106000	and socialization
2106000	2108000	to make it more abstract
2108000	2110000	and more applicable.
2110000	2112000	I also hope you can
2112000	2114000	give me some advice.
2116000	2118000	Many people
2118000	2120000	are not familiar with
2120000	2122000	law and history,
2122000	2124000	so I hope I can
2124000	2126000	give you a brief introduction
2126000	2128000	of what I am doing in this field.
2128000	2130000	I also want to
2130000	2132000	take this opportunity
2132000	2134000	to let you know
2134000	2136000	what is the purpose
2136000	2138000	of the American Academy of Law
2138000	2140000	and what is the purpose
2140000	2142000	of the American Academy of Law.
2146000	2148000	Did I answer your question?
2148000	2150000	Yes, you did.
2150000	2152000	Thank you.
2168000	2170000	If not,
2170000	2172000	please continue.
2172000	2174000	Thank you.
2180000	2182000	I think the training
2182000	2184000	from Northwestern University
2184000	2186000	is very interesting.
2186000	2188000	Foreign students
2188000	2190000	have to take a class
2190000	2192000	in English.
2192000	2194000	The teacher will teach us
2194000	2196000	some tips.
2196000	2198000	When you don't know what to say,
2198000	2200000	just take a sip of water.
2200000	2202000	No one will ask you
2202000	2204000	why you are drinking water.
2204000	2206000	Sometimes,
2206000	2208000	you can relax
2208000	2210000	and think about
2210000	2212000	what you want to say.
2212000	2214000	Let's move on
2214000	2216000	to the topic of
2216000	2218000	extracurricular law.
2218000	2220000	Extracurricular law,
2220000	2222000	at least for me,
2222000	2224000	is a term
2224000	2226000	but we don't know
2226000	2228000	what actually happens
2228000	2230000	to it.
2230000	2232000	To put it simply,
2232000	2234000	extracurricular law
2234000	2236000	is the privilege that
2236000	2238000	foreigners are not
2238000	2240000	under the jurisdiction
2240000	2242000	of the local courts.
2242000	2244000	In other words,
2244000	2246000	in 1900,
2246000	2248000	if an American
2248000	2250000	stole or committed a crime
2250000	2252000	in China
2252000	2254000	or any other country
2254000	2256000	wanted to sue him,
2256000	2258000	the Chinese government
2258000	2260000	and the Chinese courts
2260000	2262000	couldn't do anything
2262000	2264000	because he was under the jurisdiction
2264000	2266000	of the local courts.
2266000	2268000	Only the U.S. courts
2268000	2270000	or the U.S. courts
2270000	2272000	can deal with such cases.
2272000	2274000	This is extracurricular law.
2274000	2276000	Extracurricular law still exists
2276000	2278000	in some countries.
2278000	2280000	For example,
2280000	2282000	if an American
2282000	2284000	raped a woman
2284000	2286000	or a child
2286000	2288000	in a local court,
2288000	2290000	the Japanese courts
2290000	2292000	couldn't bring him to trial
2292000	2294000	because he was under the jurisdiction
2294000	2296000	of the U.S. courts.
2296000	2298000	It's not that the U.S. courts
2298000	2300000	couldn't bring him to trial,
2300000	2302000	but the U.S. courts.
2302000	2304000	It sounds unreasonable.
2304000	2306000	Let's move on.
2306000	2308000	The first time that
2308000	2310000	the U.S. signed a treaty
2310000	2312000	was in 1842,
2312000	2314000	the Treaty of Nanjing,
2314000	2316000	China signed a treaty
2316000	2318000	after the Opium War.
2318000	2320000	In this treaty,
2320000	2322000	the U.K. required
2322000	2324000	China to provide
2324000	2326000	extracurricular law to the U.K.
2326000	2328000	The U.S. signed the treaty
2328000	2330000	in 1844,
2330000	2332000	the Treaty of Wangxia,
2332000	2334000	China.
2334000	2336000	In Chinese textbooks,
2336000	2338000	extracurricular law
2338000	2340000	is a symbol of
2340000	2342000	imperialism.
2342000	2344000	Today, our country's citizens
2344000	2346000	are being bullied.
2346000	2348000	Why doesn't our country
2348000	2350000	promote justice?
2350000	2352000	Why does the U.S. court
2352000	2354000	have to bring him to trial?
2354000	2356000	The U.S. court
2356000	2358000	must be very biased.
2358000	2360000	The U.S. court
2360000	2362000	must tolerate
2362000	2364000	the U.S. people
2364000	2366000	because the U.S. people
2366000	2368000	betrayed the sovereignty
2368000	2370000	of China.
2370000	2372000	The U.S. court must
2372000	2374000	revolutionize the U.S.
2374000	2376000	The U.S. court
2376000	2378000	must abolish extracurricular law
2378000	2380000	so that the Chinese people
2380000	2382000	will no longer be bullied.
2382000	2384000	Is it really like this?
2384000	2386000	Let's move on.
2386000	2388000	For example,
2388000	2390000	when the U.S. came to China
2390000	2392000	to negotiate the Treaty of Wangxia,
2392000	2394000	the U.S. diplomat,
2394000	2396000	William Cushing,
2396000	2398000	gave a speech
2398000	2400000	in the U.S. Congress.
2400000	2402000	He said,
2402000	2404000	his proudest moment
2404000	2406000	was when the U.S. wrote
2406000	2408000	the extracurricular law
2408000	2410000	in the Treaty of Wangxia.
2410000	2412000	Because China
2412000	2414000	is an uncivilized place.
2414000	2416000	The judges in their countries
2416000	2418000	do not have three powers.
2418000	2420000	The county magistrates
2420000	2422000	do not have three powers.
2422000	2424000	How can the county magistrates
2424000	2426000	be the judges?
2426000	2428000	In Taiwan,
2428000	2430000	can He Wen-je be a judge?
2430000	2432000	No.
2432000	2434000	Administrative and judicial
2434000	2436000	should be separated.
2436000	2438000	China is an uncivilized country.
2438000	2440000	If you commit a serious crime,
2440000	2442000	you will be imprisoned,
2442000	2444000	you will be tortured,
2444000	2446000	you will be beaten.
2446000	2448000	If our people
2448000	2450000	are the most advanced species,
2450000	2452000	how can we obey the laws of the barbarians?
2452000	2454000	Therefore,
2454000	2456000	obtaining the extracurricular law
2456000	2458000	is a civilized victory.
2458000	2460000	It sounds like a good idea.
2460000	2462000	However,
2462000	2464000	historians have found
2464000	2466000	that before 1868,
2466000	2468000	we could not find
2468000	2470000	any Chinese history
2470000	2472000	against the extracurricular law.
2472000	2474000	This is actually
2474000	2476000	a very strange thing.
2476000	2478000	If China is so powerful,
2478000	2480000	why does China never object
2480000	2482000	to all the negotiations?
2482000	2484000	China thinks it is good.
2484000	2486000	Why?
2486000	2488000	If you want to extracurricular law,
2488000	2490000	we will give it to you.
2490000	2492000	This question
2492000	2494000	is related to a very popular research topic
2494000	2496000	in recent history,
2496000	2498000	which is the multidimensionalism
2498000	2500000	of the empire and the law.
2500000	2502000	In fact,
2502000	2504000	the majority of human history
2504000	2506000	is dominated by the British
2506000	2508000	and the Germans.
2508000	2510000	In fact,
2510000	2512000	the majority of human history
2512000	2514000	is dominated by the Empire.
2514000	2516000	What is the Empire?
2516000	2518000	The simplest definition
2518000	2520000	is that
2520000	2522000	under a regime,
2522000	2524000	there are many different
2524000	2526000	ethnic groups
2526000	2528000	and activists.
2528000	2530000	For example,
2530000	2532000	the Qing Dynasty
2532000	2534000	was an empire
2534000	2536000	with Han people,
2536000	2538000	Tibetans,
2538000	2540000	Mongols,
2540000	2542000	ethnic minorities
2542000	2544000	and Xinjiang people.
2544000	2546000	The next question is
2546000	2548000	that we all know that
2548000	2550000	there is a law called the Qing Dynasty Law.
2550000	2552000	But did the Qing Dynasty Law
2552000	2554000	apply in Tibet?
2554000	2556000	Did the Qing Dynasty Law
2556000	2558000	apply in Xinjiang?
2558000	2560000	In fact, it did not.
2560000	2562000	Although the Qing Dynasty Law
2562000	2564000	applied to most empires,
2564000	2566000	the Roman Empire
2566000	2568000	also applied the law to the Jews.
2568000	2570000	In the Qing Dynasty,
2570000	2572000	the Mongols still applied
2572000	2574000	the traditional Mongolian law,
2574000	2576000	while the Tibetans still applied the Tibetan law.
2576000	2578000	Only the Han people
2578000	2580000	applied the Qing Dynasty Law.
2580000	2582000	This is understandable.
2582000	2584000	When a country is very large
2584000	2586000	and is an empire,
2586000	2588000	how could it be possible
2588000	2590000	to force a Mongolian
2590000	2592000	to marry in a Confucian way?
2594000	2596000	This is also a question of
2596000	2598000	the cost of rule.
2598000	2600000	In order to maintain the operation of an empire
2600000	2602000	and the coordination of the ethnic groups,
2602000	2604000	you must use different laws
2604000	2606000	to treat different people.
2606000	2608000	This is now called
2608000	2610000	the law pluralism.
2610000	2612000	Does Taiwan want to do the same thing?
2612000	2614000	Should the indigenous people
2614000	2616000	apply the indigenous law
2616000	2618000	or not?
2618000	2620000	From the perspective of China,
2620000	2622000	in 1842,
2622000	2624000	the British said
2624000	2626000	that they wanted to
2626000	2628000	apply the British law in China.
2628000	2630000	Think about it.
2630000	2632000	What's wrong with
2632000	2634000	the Mongolians
2634000	2636000	applying the Mongolian law
2636000	2638000	and the British applying the British law?
2638000	2640000	At that time,
2640000	2642000	foreigners could only
2642000	2644000	move around
2644000	2646000	when they came to China.
2646000	2648000	Basically,
2648000	2650000	it did not affect the original life of the Han people.
2650000	2652000	Therefore,
2652000	2654000	there is nothing wrong with
2654000	2656000	giving you a piece of land
2656000	2658000	and having your own law.
2658000	2660000	In 1842,
2660000	2662000	foreigners were limited to Guangzhou.
2662000	2664000	We call it the Guangzhou system.
2664000	2666000	Originally in Guangzhou,
2666000	2668000	in 1842,
2668000	2670000	China had already admitted
2670000	2672000	that the Americans could apply the British law
2672000	2674000	in Guangzhou.
2674000	2676000	Therefore, in 1842 and 1844,
2676000	2678000	foreigners came to China
2678000	2680000	and told the negotiators
2680000	2682000	that they wanted to apply the foreign law.
2682000	2684000	The Chinese thought it was good,
2684000	2686000	so they gave it to them.
2686000	2688000	However, in 1868,
2688000	2690000	people found that something was wrong.
2690000	2692000	At first,
2692000	2694000	there were many cases
2694000	2696000	in which
2696000	2698000	foreigners committed crimes
2698000	2700000	in China
2700000	2702000	and could not be punished.
2702000	2704000	In these cases,
2704000	2706000	too many countries had foreign law,
2706000	2708000	so the legal vacuum was created.
2708000	2710000	Finally,
2710000	2712000	in 1910,
2712000	2714000	there were 23 countries with foreign law in China.
2714000	2716000	We often see in the files
2716000	2718000	that an American
2718000	2720000	committed a crime
2720000	2722000	and was arrested in the U.S. Court.
2722000	2724000	The first defense he made was
2724000	2726000	that he was not an American,
2726000	2728000	but an Englishman.
2728000	2730000	Because he had a lot of passports,
2730000	2732000	he kept hiding.
2732000	2734000	Later, he made Shanghai the most
2734000	2736000	famous criminal heaven in the world,
2736000	2738000	because everyone would not be arrested.
2738000	2740000	This problem became more and more serious,
2740000	2742000	affecting China's security,
2742000	2744000	China's economic development,
2744000	2746000	and so on.
2746000	2748000	Later,
2748000	2750000	he began to think that
2750000	2752000	it was a matter of right to enter the country,
2752000	2754000	and we had to oppose it.
2754000	2756000	To this day,
2756000	2758000	there is a modern meaning.
2758000	2760000	For example,
2760000	2762000	every year on January 11th,
2762000	2764000	there is a Judiciary Day,
2764000	2766000	and the Judiciary Council
2766000	2768000	holds a seminar and a celebration.
2768000	2770000	Why is there a Judiciary Day
2770000	2772000	on January 11th?
2772000	2774000	Because January 11th, 1943
2774000	2776000	was the day
2776000	2778000	when China and the U.S.
2778000	2780000	signed an equal treaty
2780000	2782000	and abolished foreign law.
2782000	2784000	They thought that from that day on,
2784000	2786000	the judicial system of the Republic of China
2786000	2788000	would no longer be dominated by the West.
2788000	2790000	Since then,
2790000	2792000	the Nationalist government
2792000	2794000	moved to Taiwan in 1949,
2794000	2796000	so the Judiciary Day
2796000	2798000	is still on January 11th.
2798000	2800000	Do you still remember
2800000	2802000	the Lincoln case?
2802000	2804000	It was about a British man
2804000	2806000	who died in Taiwan.
2806000	2808000	Later, he fled the country
2808000	2810000	and returned to the U.K.
2810000	2812000	At that time,
2812000	2814000	the U.K. House of Representatives
2814000	2816000	decided that Lincoln
2816000	2818000	should be transferred back to Taiwan.
2818000	2820000	The representative of the U.K.
2820000	2822000	was Ambassador St. Luke.
2822000	2824000	I attended his class with Ian.
2824000	2826000	Ambassador St. Luke was
2826000	2828000	the Minister of Foreign Affairs
2828000	2830000	when he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs
2830000	2832000	at the University of Taitung.
2832000	2834000	He said in a newspaper
2834000	2836000	that Lincoln should have
2836000	2838000	a symbolic meaning,
2838000	2840000	because the law in the U.K.
2840000	2842000	cannot be transferred
2842000	2844000	to a country that is not civilized by the law.
2844000	2846000	At that time,
2846000	2848000	Ambassador St. Luke wrote an article
2848000	2850000	that the Lincoln case proved
2850000	2852000	that the U.K. had become
2852000	2854000	a country that was civilized by the law,
2854000	2856000	so the U.K. would be willing
2856000	2858000	to transfer people back to Taiwan.
2858000	2860000	However, when the second trial was overturned,
2860000	2862000	the U.K. was defeated.
2862000	2864000	However, in the hearts of many
2864000	2866000	lawyers and diplomats,
2866000	2868000	the rule of law
2868000	2870000	in the U.K.
2870000	2872000	must be carried on
2872000	2874000	by a civilized country.
2874000	2876000	My question is very simple.
2876000	2878000	Is foreign law really better?
2878000	2880000	We can see that
2880000	2882000	the U.S.
2882000	2884000	must maintain a court
2884000	2886000	in China,
2886000	2888000	and it must invest a lot of money.
2888000	2890000	In fact, we can also
2890000	2892000	intuitively find that
2892000	2894000	if a U.S. court
2894000	2896000	in China
2896000	2898000	favors U.S. citizens,
2898000	2900000	Chinese people
2900000	2902000	should not do business
2902000	2904000	with U.S. citizens.
2904000	2906000	Chinese people do not want to
2906000	2908000	get along with U.S. citizens,
2908000	2910000	which will worsen Sino-U.S. relations
2910000	2912000	and damage U.S. business interests in China.
2912000	2914000	My question is
2914000	2916000	if foreign law is really better,
2916000	2918000	how does it actually work?
2918000	2920000	Let's go to the U.S.
2920000	2922000	Can I ask a question?
2922000	2924000	Sure, go ahead.
2924000	2926000	I'd like to ask...
2926000	2928000	You can go back to your seat.
2928000	2930000	Okay.
2930000	2932000	I'd like to ask...
2932000	2934000	I'd like to ask...
2934000	2936000	Can you tell us
2936000	2938000	who sent the question?
2938000	2940000	Can you introduce yourself
2940000	2942000	so that we can understand
2942000	2944000	the situation better?
2944000	2946000	Thank you.
2946000	2948000	Okay, I'm
2948000	2950000	Hong Shaoming.
2950000	2952000	I'm also a postdoc at Caltech.
2952000	2954000	I graduated from NTU Psychology.
2954000	2956000	I'd like to ask...
2956000	2958000	When you talk about
2958000	2960000	foreign law,
2960000	2962000	do you mean
2962000	2964000	foreign law and
2964000	2966000	multilateralism?
2966000	2968000	Are they the same?
2968000	2970000	At least on the surface,
2970000	2972000	when you talk about
2972000	2974000	multilateralism,
2974000	2976000	you're talking about
2976000	2978000	the international community.
2978000	2980000	But foreign law is about
2980000	2982000	the relationship between
2982000	2984000	countries.
2984000	2986000	This can also be applied to...
2986000	2988000	For example, you just mentioned
2988000	2990000	that before 1868,
2990000	2992000	China did not oppose
2992000	2994000	foreign law.
2994000	2996000	It is possible that
2996000	2998000	they have always felt that
2998000	3000000	foreign law is one form
3000000	3002000	of multilateralism.
3002000	3004000	After 25 years,
3004000	3006000	do you think
3006000	3008000	foreign law and
3008000	3010000	multilateralism are related?
3010000	3012000	Thank you.
3012000	3014000	I think
3014000	3016000	everyone can accept
3016000	3018000	multilateralism
3018000	3020000	under the previous rule.
3020000	3022000	Because it is a low-cost
3022000	3024000	way to maintain national governance.
3024000	3026000	So most of the current research
3026000	3028000	believes that
3028000	3030000	before 1868,
3030000	3032000	Chinese central government officials
3032000	3034000	did not oppose
3034000	3036000	multilateralism.
3036000	3038000	Because it is not necessarily
3038000	3040000	within a country.
3040000	3042000	For example,
3042000	3044000	when Western missionaries
3044000	3046000	came to China,
3046000	3048000	China also respected
3048000	3050000	the use of its own laws
3050000	3052000	to deal with its own problems.
3052000	3054000	After 1868,
3054000	3056000	I think it is because
3056000	3058000	China wants to modernize.
3058000	3060000	So in the process of modernization,
3060000	3062000	we can achieve the ability
3062000	3064000	of central power and mobilization
3064000	3066000	that modern countries want.
3066000	3068000	We can also see that
3068000	3070000	after the establishment of the Republic of China,
3070000	3072000	China hopes that
3072000	3074000	Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang
3074000	3076000	all use the laws of the Republic of China.
3076000	3078000	China no longer respects
3078000	3080000	China's autonomy.
3080000	3082000	China's autonomy has become very limited.
3082000	3084000	The current People's Republic of China
3084000	3086000	also hopes that
3086000	3088000	Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang
3088000	3090000	all use the laws of the Republic of China.
3090000	3092000	I think the same is true for Hong Kong.
3092000	3094000	At the beginning,
3094000	3096000	China thought that
3096000	3098000	Hong Kongers could continue
3098000	3100000	to use the law of the Republic of China.
3100000	3102000	However, when China wants to
3102000	3104000	modernize Hong Kong,
3104000	3106000	it wants to adopt
3106000	3108000	a new law of monolateralism.
3108000	3110000	After all, we are one nation,
3110000	3112000	one country.
3112000	3114000	Why can't we all
3114000	3116000	use different laws?
3116000	3118000	If you are a Mongolian,
3118000	3120000	a Tibetan, a Xinjiang or a Hong Konger,
3120000	3122000	you should adopt the same law.
3122000	3124000	You are not different.
3124000	3126000	If you are different,
3126000	3128000	you are admitting that
3128000	3130000	China is not a monolateral country.
3130000	3132000	I think the real difference
3132000	3134000	between legal pluralism and
3134000	3136000	legal monolateralism is that
3136000	3138000	in the process of
3138000	3140000	transferring from the empire
3140000	3142000	to a democratic country,
3142000	3144000	China wants to strengthen
3144000	3146000	Hong Kong.
3146000	3148000	In your opinion,
3148000	3150000	in a democratic country,
3150000	3152000	legal pluralism is
3152000	3154000	different from
3154000	3156000	legal monolateralism,
3156000	3158000	isn't it?
3158000	3160000	Not necessarily.
3160000	3162000	It should be said that
3162000	3164000	legal pluralism is
3164000	3166000	different from
3166000	3168000	legal monolateralism.
3168000	3170000	It should be said that
3170000	3172000	in a democratic country,
3172000	3174000	you should adopt the same law.
3174000	3176000	Foreigners adopt the same law
3176000	3178000	because they want to
3178000	3180000	show their national sovereignty.
3180000	3182000	Yes.
3182000	3184000	Your defense of
3184000	3186000	legal pluralism is that
3186000	3188000	it may show
3188000	3190000	the spirit of
3190000	3192000	legal pluralism.
3192000	3194000	But in some countries,
3194000	3196000	legal pluralism and
3196000	3198000	legal monolateralism are
3198000	3200000	fundamentally different.
3200000	3202000	First of all,
3202000	3204000	legal pluralism can,
3204000	3206000	but legal monolateralism can't.
3206000	3208000	Second, it can explain
3208000	3210000	why China did not oppose
3210000	3212000	at the beginning.
3212000	3214000	Because they thought
3214000	3216000	it was different.
3216000	3218000	At first, they thought
3218000	3220000	it was the same thing.
3220000	3222000	Their opposition was
3222000	3224000	when they found
3224000	3226000	that it was actually
3226000	3228000	different and
3228000	3230000	they could not support
3230000	3232000	whether it was good or
3232000	3234000	bad.
3234000	3236000	But when I first
3236000	3238000	talked about it,
3238000	3240000	historians would ask
3240000	3242000	why they could not
3242000	3244000	find opposition in 1868.
3244000	3246000	We would say that
3246000	3248000	we thought that the subjective
3248000	3250000	will of the activists
3250000	3252000	at that time
3252000	3254000	mixed it with
3254000	3256000	legal pluralism.
3256000	3258000	In other words,
3258000	3260000	the reason why historians
3260000	3262000	did not oppose
3262000	3264000	is that they thought
3264000	3266000	it was a mix of two things.
3266000	3268000	It is a bit like
3268000	3270000	what I just said.
3270000	3272000	At first, they thought
3272000	3274000	it was the same thing,
3274000	3276000	so they did not oppose.
3276000	3278000	But later they found
3278000	3280000	that it was different.
3280000	3282000	Anyway,
3282000	3284000	we have spent too much time
3284000	3286000	I would like to add
3286000	3288000	a cold knowledge.
3288000	3290000	My ex-boss is an expert
3290000	3292000	on the LinkedIn case.
3292000	3294000	Oh, really?
3294000	3296000	Did he prove that Taiwan
3296000	3298000	is a civilized country?
3298000	3300000	The main reason
3300000	3302000	why he was invited
3302000	3304000	was to ask
3304000	3306000	whether there was a significant difference
3306000	3308000	between the British and the Taiwanese
3308000	3310000	in terms of quantity.
3310000	3312000	I see.
3312000	3314000	That's all.
3314000	3316000	Please go on.
3316000	3318000	OK.
3318000	3320000	Sorry,
3320000	3322000	I am running out of time.
3322000	3324000	So,
3324000	3326000	in 1906,
3326000	3328000	the U.S. carried out
3328000	3330000	a judicial reform in Shanghai.
3330000	3332000	From 1844 to 1905,
3332000	3334000	the U.S. did not
3334000	3336000	establish a formal court
3336000	3338000	in China.
3338000	3340000	We often hear the term
3340000	3342000	that the U.S. sent
3342000	3344000	a diplomat to be a judge.
3344000	3346000	In other words,
3346000	3348000	if an American committed a crime in China,
3348000	3350000	he would be sent to the local consulate
3350000	3352000	to be tried.
3352000	3354000	Who is the judge?
3354000	3356000	It is a diplomat.
3356000	3358000	Sometimes, the diplomat
3358000	3360000	also has some legislative powers.
3360000	3362000	It is a tricky situation.
3362000	3364000	When the U.S. criticized China
3364000	3366000	for not having a separation of powers
3366000	3368000	and not being civilized,
3368000	3370000	because the diplomat is an administrator
3370000	3372000	and has the right to be tried,
3372000	3374000	the U.S. is a system
3374000	3376000	of three powers.
3376000	3378000	The U.S. is not civilized at all.
3378000	3380000	The U.S. is more like
3380000	3382000	the governor-general
3382000	3384000	or the county magistrate of China,
3384000	3386000	like Bao Qingtian.
3386000	3388000	He is a mayor
3388000	3390000	and a judge at the same time.
3390000	3392000	Next,
3392000	3394000	the U.S. was not a rich country
3394000	3396000	at that time.
3396000	3398000	The U.S. did not invest
3398000	3400000	a lot of people,
3400000	3402000	finance and legal experts
3402000	3404000	in China.
3404000	3406000	For example,
3406000	3408000	the U.S. did not have a prison
3408000	3410000	at the beginning.
3410000	3412000	The U.S. even rented a prison
3412000	3414000	to the British and French,
3414000	3416000	because the U.S. built
3416000	3418000	the British and French prisons
3418000	3420000	in Shanghai earlier.
3420000	3422000	Why did the U.S. have a legal reform
3422000	3424000	in 1906?
3424000	3426000	I will explain in the next video.
3426000	3428000	The U.S. began
3428000	3430000	the expansion of the empire
3430000	3432000	at the end of the 19th century.
3432000	3434000	In this video,
3434000	3436000	we can see two data.
3436000	3438000	The first is the date
3438000	3440000	when the U.S. acquired the colony.
3440000	3442000	Hawaii,
3442000	3444000	Wake Island,
3444000	3446000	Samoa, the Philippines,
3446000	3448000	and Panama were all
3448000	3450000	acquired at the end of the 19th century
3450000	3452000	and the beginning of the 20th century.
3452000	3454000	In other words,
3454000	3456000	between 1844 and 1900,
3456000	3458000	the U.S. did not trade much.
3458000	3460000	In the second table,
3460000	3462000	we can see that
3462000	3464000	between 1900 and 1912,
3464000	3466000	the average trade volume
3466000	3468000	of China and the U.S.
3468000	3470000	increased significantly,
3470000	3472000	and even doubled.
3472000	3474000	The expansion of the U.S.
3474000	3476000	brought a lot of trade between
3476000	3478000	China and the U.S.
3478000	3480000	At that time,
3480000	3482000	the U.S. federal government
3482000	3484000	responded that
3484000	3486000	the Judiciary
3486000	3488000	was not enough
3488000	3490000	to solve the trade dispute
3490000	3492000	between China and the U.S.
3492000	3494000	because these judges
3494000	3496000	were not legal people.
3496000	3498000	They were just diplomats.
3498000	3500000	As we all know,
3500000	3502000	diplomats abroad
3502000	3504000	were also responsible
3504000	3506000	for business affairs,
3506000	3508000	and they did not have
3508000	3510000	much influence on the U.S.
3510000	3512000	economy.
3512000	3514000	In addition,
3514000	3516000	as the U.S. expansion
3516000	3518000	spread,
3518000	3520000	a lot of smugglers
3520000	3522000	came to China,
3522000	3524000	including sex workers,
3524000	3526000	gamblers, and vagabonds.
3526000	3528000	At that time,
3528000	3530000	the U.S. missionaries
3530000	3532000	in China believed
3532000	3534000	that these illegal immigrants
3534000	3536000	had a serious impact
3536000	3538000	on the sex workers
3538000	3540000	in the U.S.
3540000	3542000	So in 1900,
3542000	3544000	all the white prostitutes
3544000	3546000	in Shanghai
3546000	3548000	said they were American.
3548000	3550000	At that time,
3550000	3552000	the word American Girl
3552000	3554000	meant prostitutes,
3554000	3556000	because every prostitute
3556000	3558000	said she was American
3558000	3560000	when she was arrested.
3560000	3562000	If you were sent to the U.K.
3562000	3564000	court,
3564000	3566000	you would be a prostitute.
3566000	3568000	At that time,
3568000	3570000	there was a lot of discussion
3570000	3572000	in the U.S.
3572000	3574000	As we can see in this picture,
3574000	3576000	foreign law was not
3576000	3578000	an important concept
3578000	3580000	for both China and the U.S.
3580000	3582000	It was not until 1900
3582000	3584000	that the word
3584000	3586000	extraterritoriality
3586000	3588000	and consular jurisdiction
3588000	3590000	began to appear
3590000	3592000	in foreign law.
3594000	3596000	On the other hand,
3596000	3598000	China also began to reform
3598000	3600000	the modern country.
3600000	3602000	In 1900,
3602000	3604000	the Eight-Nation Alliance
3604000	3606000	was established in Beijing.
3606000	3608000	After the establishment of the Eight-Nation Alliance,
3608000	3610000	Beijing signed the New Deal,
3610000	3612000	and the Qing Dynasty began
3612000	3614000	to reform the modern country.
3614000	3616000	At that time,
3616000	3618000	the modern country reform
3618000	3620000	was to transform Chinese law
3620000	3622000	into Western modern law.
3622000	3624000	The origins of the Eight-Nation Alliance
3624000	3626000	can be traced back to the
3626000	3628000	Ming and Qing dynasties
3628000	3630000	published in 1906.
3630000	3632000	If you ask a student
3632000	3634000	of the Taiwan University Law Department
3634000	3636000	who is majoring in
3636000	3638000	Law,
3638000	3640000	he will use a classic textbook
3640000	3642000	written by Wang Zhejian.
3642000	3644000	Many of the citations in that textbook
3644000	3646000	are back to the Ming and Qing dynasties.
3646000	3648000	The Ming and Qing dynasties
3648000	3650000	were published in 1906.
3650000	3652000	At that time,
3652000	3654000	China had signed
3654000	3656000	an agreement with the United Kingdom
3656000	3658000	and the United States.
3658000	3660000	The agreement said
3660000	3662000	that China was about to
3662000	3664000	start legal and judicial reform,
3664000	3666000	and Western states
3666000	3668000	had to help it.
3668000	3670000	If you helped,
3670000	3672000	and later I succeeded in reforming,
3672000	3674000	you would be expelled from foreign law.
3674000	3676000	At that time,
3676000	3678000	the United States was faced
3678000	3680000	with a new legal system
3680000	3682000	that needed to be improved
3682000	3684000	in order to improve
3684000	3686000	Sino-US trade relations.
3686000	3688000	On the other hand,
3688000	3690000	China was about to start
3690000	3692000	legal and judicial reform.
3692000	3694000	What if China really became
3694000	3696000	a modern civilized,
3696000	3698000	three-powered court,
3698000	3700000	using the same laws
3700000	3702000	as the U.S. or Taiwan?
3702000	3704000	If the U.S. still uses
3704000	3706000	a three-powered,
3706000	3708000	one-of-a-kind system,
3708000	3710000	the U.S. established
3710000	3712000	the United States Court for China
3712000	3714000	in Shanghai in 1906.
3714000	3716000	The U.S. sent
3716000	3718000	a graduate of Yale University
3718000	3720000	who was once the director
3720000	3722000	of the Philippine Procuratorate
3722000	3724000	to serve as a judge
3724000	3726000	and establish a modern court.
3726000	3728000	The judge
3728000	3730000	did three things.
3730000	3732000	The first thing he did
3732000	3734000	was to declare that
3734000	3736000	the U.S. did not do anything
3736000	3738000	related to civil and commercial affairs.
3738000	3740000	This was strange,
3740000	3742000	because the U.S. business community
3742000	3744000	wanted him to deal with
3744000	3746000	some business cases and disputes.
3746000	3748000	Instead, he had to deal
3748000	3750000	with brothels and casinos.
3750000	3752000	He felt that
3752000	3754000	many U.S. lawyers
3754000	3756000	had a bad image of the Chinese.
3756000	3758000	So he called all the U.S. lawyers
3758000	3760000	in Shanghai
3760000	3762000	for a legal exam.
3762000	3764000	80% of the U.S. lawyers
3764000	3766000	failed the exam,
3766000	3768000	which caused a great uproar.
3768000	3770000	The U.S. lawyers
3770000	3772000	were not allowed to come
3772000	3774000	to the U.S. court.
3774000	3776000	The next thing he did
3776000	3778000	was to sue the boss
3778000	3780000	of eight brothels
3780000	3782000	and four casinos.
3782000	3784000	In the past,
3784000	3786000	the U.S. lawyers used
3786000	3788000	the original defense technique
3788000	3790000	to say that they were not U.S. citizens
3790000	3792000	and that they were U.S. citizens.
3792000	3794000	For example, he called
3794000	3796000	U.S. Consulates in Shanghai
3796000	3798000	and asked them
3798000	3800000	if they had ever used
3800000	3802000	U.S. Consulates.
3802000	3804000	He even asked
3804000	3806000	U.S. Consulates
3806000	3808000	to show their diplomatic documents
3808000	3810000	and ask them
3810000	3812000	if they had ever
3812000	3814000	filed a passport in the U.S. Consulate.
3814000	3816000	Some of them
3816000	3818000	even said
3818000	3820000	that the U.S. Consulate
3820000	3822000	was a legal vacuum
3822000	3824000	caused by U.S. law.
3824000	3826000	This caused
3826000	3828000	a fierce uproar
3828000	3830000	among the U.S. community
3830000	3832000	in Shanghai.
3832000	3834000	The U.S. lawyer
3834000	3836000	was impeached
3836000	3838000	and resigned a year later.
3838000	3840000	The next U.S. lawyer
3840000	3842000	was not in charge anymore.
3842000	3844000	In the future,
3844000	3846000	I think there are several
3846000	3848000	different types of
3848000	3850000	jurisdiction.
3850000	3852000	This is common in the modern world.
3852000	3854000	For example,
3854000	3856000	if a Japanese
3856000	3858000	and a Singaporean
3858000	3860000	sign a business contract,
3860000	3862000	the law can be the law of New York.
3862000	3864000	When there is a dispute,
3864000	3866000	the law can be used in Paris
3866000	3868000	to solve the dispute.
3868000	3870000	I think the situation in the world
3870000	3872000	is similar to the past.
3872000	3874000	There are many different types
3874000	3876000	of jurisdiction.
3876000	3878000	I think China in the 19th century
3878000	3880000	is a good place to develop theory.
3880000	3882000	China has pushed the situation
3882000	3884000	to the extreme.
3884000	3886000	For example,
3886000	3888000	there are nine states in Tianjin.
3888000	3890000	In Tianjin,
3890000	3892000	there are ten laws
3892000	3894000	in the same city.
3894000	3896000	There must be some
3896000	3898000	place to develop
3898000	3900000	theory and research.
3900000	3902000	Next,
3902000	3904000	I will talk about competition.
3904000	3906000	We know that
3906000	3908000	in the age of globalization,
3908000	3910000	manufacturers will look for
3910000	3912000	the place with the lowest cost
3912000	3914000	of the system.
3914000	3916000	For example,
3916000	3918000	the labor law is relatively loose,
3918000	3920000	the salary is relatively low,
3920000	3922000	or the environmental law is relatively loose.
3922000	3924000	At that time,
3924000	3926000	in China,
3926000	3928000	there were more than 20 countries
3928000	3930000	with foreign jurisdiction.
3930000	3932000	For example,
3932000	3934000	there are nine states in Tianjin.
3934000	3936000	Is there any more theory
3936000	3938000	that can be developed?
3938000	3940000	Next,
3940000	3942000	there are some foreign law in the modern world.
3942000	3944000	For example,
3944000	3946000	there is foreign law in Chongqing.
3946000	3948000	Is there any way
3948000	3950000	to push or deny
3950000	3952000	the existence
3952000	3954000	of foreign law
3954000	3956000	from the implementation
3956000	3958000	of the actual system
3958000	3960000	The last point is
3960000	3962000	who benefits from foreign law?
3962000	3964000	At that time,
3964000	3966000	the United States had a very
3966000	3968000	intense backlash,
3968000	3970000	which made it believe that
3970000	3972000	the United States should not
3972000	3974000	throw taxpayers' money
3974000	3976000	overseas for foreign law.
3976000	3978000	In fact, the Americans have been
3978000	3980000	faced with the fact that
3980000	3982000	they can not manage
3982000	3984000	the situation of their citizens
3984000	3986000	in other countries.
3986000	3988000	So they were impeached
3988000	3990000	and resigned.
3990000	3992000	Later, the judges also
3992000	3994000	continued to ignore these things.
3994000	3996000	Is there really benefit?
3996000	3998000	For example, if the image of the United States
3998000	4000000	is so bad,
4000000	4002000	if the court is not fair,
4002000	4004000	the Chinese will resist your goods.
4004000	4006000	So it seems that foreign law
4006000	4008000	is not something that can be
4008000	4010000	implemented indefinitely.
4010000	4012000	In addition to the law itself,
4012000	4014000	there are many other factors to consider.
4014000	4016000	In the first part,
4016000	4018000	the teacher will ask you
4018000	4020000	to understand the content of the system
4020000	4022000	and then think about
4022000	4024000	more theoretical and abstract
4024000	4026000	things with your eyes.
4026000	4028000	So today I will briefly
4028000	4030000	report to you.
4030000	4032000	Please give me your advice.
4032000	4034000	Thank you.
4038000	4040000	I think today's lecture is really wonderful.
4040000	4042000	I really learned a lot.
4042000	4044000	It's like a book.
4044000	4046000	I think it's pretty exciting.
4046000	4048000	Do you have any questions?
4048000	4050000	Please feel free to ask.
4050000	4052000	If you can,
4052000	4054000	please briefly introduce yourself
4054000	4056000	before asking questions.
4062000	4064000	Can I ask another question?
4064000	4066000	Welcome.
4066000	4068000	Sorry, the question just ended.
4068000	4070000	I'm afraid it will delay your time.
4070000	4072000	If I ask you now,
4072000	4074000	if we want
4074000	4076000	contemporary foreign law
4076000	4078000	to continue to exist,
4078000	4080000	what do you think
4080000	4082000	is the best way
4082000	4084000	to defend it?
4084000	4086000	What is the direction?
4086000	4088000	Why does contemporary foreign law
4088000	4090000	still need to exist?
4090000	4092000	If I ask you to make
4092000	4094000	the strongest defense,
4094000	4096000	what should it be?
4096000	4098000	Thank you.
4098000	4100000	I think it depends on
4100000	4102000	who you are talking to.
4102000	4104000	For example,
4104000	4106000	there are a lot of things
4106000	4108000	that are close to foreign law.
4108000	4110000	For example,
4110000	4112000	investment in heavy industry.
4112000	4114000	What is investment in heavy industry?
4114000	4116000	For example,
4116000	4118000	a Singaporean came to Taiwan
4118000	4120000	to invest.
4120000	4122000	He bought a piece of land.
4122000	4124000	As a result,
4124000	4126000	today our government
4126000	4128000	does not support
4128000	4130000	the acquisition of land.
4130000	4132000	At this time,
4132000	4134000	according to our domestic law,
4134000	4136000	if he does not support
4136000	4138000	the acquisition,
4138000	4140000	he thinks it is illegal.
4140000	4142000	Then he should be sued
4142000	4144000	by our administrative court.
4144000	4146000	However,
4146000	4148000	because we have an investment
4148000	4150000	guarantee agreement with Singapore,
4150000	4152000	at this time,
4152000	4154000	this Singaporean
4154000	4156000	did not support
4156000	4158000	Taiwan's domestic law.
4158000	4160000	Instead, he sued
4160000	4162000	the World Bank's
4162000	4164000	Investment Heavy Industry Center.
4164000	4166000	This is a bit like
4166000	4168000	not being governed by the domestic court.
4168000	4170000	We entrust him to a third party.
4170000	4172000	In fact, foreign law
4172000	4174000	is entrusted to his motherland.
4174000	4176000	Of course,
4176000	4178000	in Africa or some countries
4178000	4180000	where the law is not so stable,
4180000	4182000	or you do not trust
4182000	4184000	the law or the court,
4184000	4186000	you have to entrust
4186000	4188000	the solution of this dispute
4188000	4190000	to a fair institution
4190000	4192000	that you believe in.
4192000	4194000	Then this foreign law
4194000	4196000	will be meaningful.
4196000	4198000	So some people ask,
4198000	4200000	because there used to be a theory
4200000	4202000	called the law and development theory.
4202000	4204000	He believes that in the process
4204000	4206000	of capitalist development,
4206000	4208000	good courts must be coordinated
4208000	4210000	to help each other.
4210000	4212000	Otherwise, there will be a lot of
4212000	4214000	commercial disputes in capitalism,
4214000	4216000	and you need a good court to solve them.
4216000	4218000	Some people ask,
4218000	4220000	why is the Chinese court
4220000	4222000	so biased?
4222000	4224000	Xi Jinping said that the court
4224000	4226000	should trust the party.
4226000	4228000	Everyone knows that
4228000	4230000	Google sued Baidu,
4230000	4232000	and Baidu won.
4232000	4234000	Why is the development of
4234000	4236000	Chinese capitalism so good?
4236000	4238000	Many people think that
4238000	4240000	the problem of foreign law
4240000	4242000	is not solved by the people's court,
4242000	4244000	but you can entrust it to another
4244000	4246000	third party institution
4246000	4248000	that you believe in.
4248000	4250000	So I think that foreign law
4250000	4252000	can replace certain legal developments
4252000	4254000	at least in the commercial part,
4254000	4256000	or the court is not so
4256000	4258000	healthy and credible.
4258000	4260000	It can help attract investment
4260000	4262000	and people outside
4262000	4264000	can go to the court
4264000	4266000	with confidence.
4266000	4268000	It can help attract investment
4268000	4270000	and people outside
4270000	4272000	can go to the court
4272000	4274000	with confidence.
4274000	4276000	In terms of the form,
4276000	4278000	I don't think that
4278000	4280000	some countries
4280000	4282000	still have meat
4282000	4284000	or planets.
4284000	4286000	In order to protect foreigners,
4286000	4288000	in order to make foreigners
4288000	4290000	willing to invest in your country,
4290000	4292000	in order to make foreigners
4292000	4294000	willing to travel to your country,
4294000	4296000	in order to make foreigners
4296000	4298000	willing to travel to your country,
4298000	4300000	you have to give them
4300000	4302000	some kind of protection of foreign law.
4302000	4304000	You can understand that.
4304000	4306000	In fact, the most common foreign law
4306000	4308000	is applied to diplomats.
4308000	4310000	If a diplomat breaks the law locally,
4310000	4312000	he is not subject to the local laws
4312000	4314000	and courts.
4314000	4316000	This is part of the diplomatic privilege.
4316000	4318000	Of course, we believe that
4318000	4320000	there is still some foreign law
4320000	4322000	in respect of foreign history.
4322000	4324000	But to me,
4324000	4326000	it sounds like the reason
4326000	4328000	why foreign law should disappear.
4328000	4330000	If in the ideal reality,
4330000	4332000	we have a very fair third party,
4332000	4334000	let's say it's a certain court
4334000	4336000	made up of 200 countries.
4336000	4338000	If you want to deal with criminal matters,
4338000	4340000	you can throw it to the criminal court.
4340000	4342000	If you want to deal with civil matters,
4342000	4344000	you can throw it to the civil court.
4344000	4346000	This court can judge a person
4346000	4348000	fairly.
4348000	4350000	For example,
4350000	4352000	if a Singaporean comes to Taiwan
4352000	4354000	and does something similar,
4354000	4356000	we don't need
4356000	4358000	Singapore's foreign law
4358000	4360000	or Taiwan's foreign law in Taiwan,
4360000	4362000	right?
4362000	4364000	I understand
4364000	4366000	why
4366000	4368000	the two questions are not interrelated.
4368000	4370000	Let's go back to
4370000	4372000	the definition of foreign law.
4372000	4374000	In fact,
4374000	4376000	when we talk about
4376000	4378000	foreign law,
4378000	4380000	it means that foreigners are not
4380000	4382000	privileged by the local
4382000	4384000	legal courts.
4384000	4386000	But it is not necessarily
4386000	4388000	in accordance with
4388000	4390000	the law of his motherland
4390000	4392000	or the law of the third party
4392000	4394000	or the jurisdiction of the third party.
4394000	4396000	So when I just answered,
4396000	4398000	I went back to the original definition
4398000	4400000	of foreign law.
4400000	4402000	But what you just discussed
4402000	4404000	should be said
4404000	4406000	that today a person
4406000	4408000	is not privileged by the local
4408000	4410000	legal courts.
4410000	4412000	But I don't think
4412000	4414000	all cases
4414000	4416000	can find
4416000	4418000	a fair third party.
4420000	4422000	I understand.
4422000	4424000	For example,
4424000	4426000	in the case of criminal law,
4426000	4428000	I have not received any
4428000	4430000	legal or historical training.
4430000	4432000	In my imagination,
4432000	4434000	for example,
4434000	4436000	if the British
4436000	4438000	come to Taiwan to commit a crime,
4438000	4440000	and then you want to say that
4440000	4442000	we British should have foreign law,
4442000	4444000	we want to introduce it back to
4444000	4446000	the British trial,
4446000	4448000	it seems to prove
4448000	4450000	why the British return to
4450000	4452000	the British trial
4452000	4454000	is better than
4454000	4456000	the trial in Taiwan.
4456000	4458000	One of the cases is
4458000	4460000	that the legal system
4460000	4462000	of some African countries
4462000	4464000	has been changed.
4464000	4466000	It is not easy to prove
4466000	4468000	that your national
4468000	4470000	legal system is worse than mine,
4470000	4472000	so it should be introduced
4472000	4474000	back to my own country.
4476000	4478000	Yes.
4478000	4480000	There are some standards.
4480000	4482000	For example,
4482000	4484000	because European countries
4484000	4486000	have abolished the death penalty,
4486000	4488000	it will not be introduced
4488000	4490000	into a country that will be sentenced
4490000	4492000	to death in Taiwan.
4492000	4494000	It is quite obvious
4494000	4496000	in some extreme examples.
4496000	4498000	For example,
4498000	4500000	if Lin Keying is a murderer in Taiwan today,
4500000	4502000	because murderers in Taiwan
4502000	4504000	will be sentenced to death,
4504000	4506000	so when she returns to the UK,
4506000	4508000	the UK will not introduce her
4508000	4510000	back to Taiwan.
4510000	4512000	But this means that
4512000	4514000	the British have an assumption
4514000	4516000	that a country with a death penalty
4516000	4518000	or a death penalty
4518000	4520000	is a country with a death penalty.
4520000	4522000	But I think this matter
4522000	4524000	also requires a process.
4524000	4526000	If you want to have an extramarital law,
4526000	4528000	you have to prove that
4528000	4530000	my legal system is better than yours.
4530000	4532000	In some cases,
4532000	4534000	this process may be easier,
4534000	4536000	but in some cases
4536000	4538000	it may not be so easy.
4538000	4540000	Of course,
4540000	4542000	now it happens
4542000	4544000	whether it is easy or not.
4544000	4546000	If I don't want to give you a death penalty,
4546000	4548000	you have to ask yourself
4548000	4550000	how strong or how weak
4550000	4552000	your country is.
4552000	4554000	You have to ask yourself
4554000	4556000	whether you are strong
4556000	4558000	in international negotiations.
4560000	4562000	I used to think
4562000	4564000	that I could not prove
4564000	4566000	that extramarital law
4566000	4568000	is inefficient
4568000	4570000	in the way of economics.
4570000	4572000	This is one of the things
4572000	4574000	I might want to do in the future.
4574000	4576000	I think there are several levels of problems.
4576000	4578000	The first one is whether
4578000	4580000	extramarital law is inefficient.
4580000	4582000	Extramarital law will cause
4582000	4584000	legal vacuum.
4584000	4586000	Legal vacuum is like
4586000	4588000	Shanghai in the early 20th century.
4588000	4590000	No one can do anything.
4590000	4592000	This is what we don't want to see.
4592000	4594000	From this perspective,
4594000	4596000	extramarital law is inefficient.
4596000	4598000	On the other hand,
4598000	4600000	many extramarital laws
4600000	4602000	are competing in good systems.
4602000	4604000	For example,
4604000	4606000	Tianjin is divided into
4606000	4608000	ten land laws.
4608000	4610000	Is it because everyone
4610000	4612000	wants to create a better land law,
4612000	4614000	so Tianjin's land
4614000	4616000	is better or worse now?
4616000	4618000	Extramarital law may be efficient,
4618000	4620000	but it may also
4620000	4622000	have other social norms
4622000	4624000	or social norms.
4624000	4626000	For example,
4626000	4628000	if you are too good
4628000	4630000	to your own country,
4630000	4632000	you will be restricted.
4632000	4634000	In the future,
4634000	4636000	I want to build a theory
4636000	4638000	that extramarital law
4638000	4640000	is inefficient or
4640000	4642000	has some advantages
4642000	4644000	and some disadvantages.
4644000	4646000	Or it has some
4646000	4648000	more important social norms
4648000	4650000	behind it.
4650000	4652000	I can also
4652000	4654000	make a point about this.
4654000	4656000	For example,
4656000	4658000	a country like the United States
4658000	4660000	sometimes
4660000	4662000	doesn't care
4662000	4664000	how much money
4664000	4666000	is worth.
4666000	4668000	For example,
4668000	4670000	if it happens between
4670000	4672000	China and the United States,
4672000	4674000	the Americans think
4674000	4676000	this person must be extradited
4676000	4678000	or he may be treated
4678000	4680000	unfairly in China.
4680000	4682000	In this case,
4682000	4684000	the economic calculation
4684000	4686000	becomes very complicated.
4686000	4688000	But the Americans think
4688000	4690000	this $10 million is to
4690000	4692000	buy our face,
4692000	4694000	so even if it is $100 million
4694000	4696000	or $100 million,
4696000	4698000	I should do it.
4698000	4700000	Of course,
4700000	4702000	each case has its own considerations.
4702000	4704000	However,
4704000	4706000	I think the extramarital law
4706000	4708000	in the end of the 19th century
4708000	4710000	or the beginning of the 20th century
4710000	4712000	is a more transparent case.
4712000	4714000	Of course,
4714000	4716000	Wang Dan was taken to the United States
4716000	4718000	from Qinchen Prison to Harvard to study PhD.
4718000	4720000	I believe this must have
4720000	4722000	his diplomatic image
4722000	4724000	or American idealistic
4724000	4726000	diplomatic policy considerations.
4726000	4728000	However,
4728000	4730000	I think that
4730000	4732000	the extramarital law
4732000	4734000	in the end of the 19th century
4734000	4736000	is a good example
4736000	4738000	to respond to the issue
4738000	4740000	of institutional competition
4740000	4742000	or institutional competition
4742000	4744000	in the United States.
4744000	4746000	For example,
4746000	4748000	most American companies
4748000	4750000	are located in Delaware,
4750000	4752000	which has the best
4752000	4754000	company law.
4754000	4756000	However,
4756000	4758000	is it really efficient
4758000	4760000	for each state
4760000	4762000	to adopt different
4762000	4764000	legal systems?
4764000	4766000	To me,
4766000	4768000	this is still
4768000	4770000	a question
4770000	4772000	that needs to be answered.
4772000	4774000	Thank you for your answer.
4774000	4776000	Thank you.
4776000	4778000	I have a question.
4778000	4780000	I'm not sure
4780000	4782000	if it's too early
4782000	4784000	or not.
4784000	4786000	If
4786000	4788000	the audience
4788000	4790000	at the scene
4790000	4792000	can leave
4792000	4794000	if there is a problem,
4794000	4796000	the recording will continue
4796000	4798000	if the audience
4798000	4800000	can leave
4800000	4802000	if there is a problem.
4802000	4804000	If you want to follow
4804000	4806000	the Q&A,
4806000	4808000	you can watch the video later.
4808000	4810000	If you can leave
4810000	4812000	now,
4812000	4814000	you can continue
4814000	4816000	the Q&A.
4816000	4818000	I have two questions.
4818000	4820000	The first one
4820000	4822000	is probably answered.
4822000	4824000	Let me ask you
4824000	4826000	one more time.
4826000	4828000	The second question is
4828000	4830000	basically
4830000	4832000	a legal study.
4832000	4834000	Since it's a legal study,
4834000	4836000	my understanding is
4836000	4838000	that it's a principle.
4838000	4840000	We start from the principle
4840000	4842000	and discuss it.
4842000	4844000	However,
4844000	4846000	from another perspective,
4846000	4848000	it's a very political
4848000	4850000	and valuable act.
4850000	4852000	It's a diplomatic act.
4852000	4854000	I can give credit to others
4854000	4856000	to strengthen my control
4856000	4858000	or dominance over others.
4858000	4860000	What do you think
4860000	4862000	about the economic
4862000	4864000	and diplomatic aspects
4864000	4866000	of extramarital law?
4866000	4868000	You've answered a part of the question.
4868000	4870000	This is my first question.
4870000	4872000	My second question
4872000	4874000	is about
4874000	4876000	extramarital law.
4876000	4878000	There is a word called
4878000	4880000	external.
4880000	4882000	There are internal and external.
4882000	4884000	How do you define
4884000	4886000	extramarital law?
4886000	4888000	Who is my citizen?
4888000	4890000	Who is not my citizen?
4890000	4892000	Who is my country?
4892000	4894000	Who is not my country?
4894000	4896000	Do you think
4896000	4898000	extramarital law
4898000	4900000	is enforced
4900000	4902000	or dilutes
4902000	4904000	the definition of a country?
4904000	4906000	Thank you.
4906000	4908000	My first question
4908000	4910000	is
4910000	4912000	about extramarital law.
4912000	4914000	You said that
4914000	4916000	extramarital law
4916000	4918000	is based on principles.
4918000	4920000	For me,
4920000	4922000	this is a more traditional
4922000	4924000	study of legal ethics.
4924000	4926000	For example,
4926000	4928000	I have a theory
4928000	4930000	about what is justice
4930000	4932000	and what is fairness.
4932000	4934000	I have some principles
4934000	4936000	and I apply them
4936000	4938000	in a logical way.
4938000	4940000	This is a more empirical
4940000	4942000	study.
4946000	4948000	I hope to draw
4948000	4950000	some theories
4950000	4952000	or calculations
4952000	4954000	from the past
4954000	4956000	so that we can
4956000	4958000	have some new directions in the future.
4958000	4960000	It is a more
4960000	4962000	social science method.
4962000	4964000	There is a word
4964000	4966000	in mainland China
4966000	4968000	called social science law.
4968000	4970000	In Taiwan,
4970000	4972000	I used to be an assistant
4972000	4974000	of Mr. Zhang Yong-cheng.
4974000	4976000	He also published a book
4976000	4978000	called Social Science Law.
4978000	4980000	I think
4980000	4982000	from my point of view,
4982000	4984000	any law
4984000	4986000	has politics in it.
4986000	4988000	We cannot say
4988000	4990000	that the study of law
4990000	4992000	can be completely
4992000	4994000	excluded from
4994000	4996000	the diplomatic context.
4996000	4998000	For me,
4998000	5000000	the big question
5000000	5002000	in my study
5002000	5004000	is how the international law
5004000	5006000	can change the domestic politics.
5006000	5008000	This is what I wrote
5008000	5010000	in my thesis.
5010000	5012000	In 1945,
5012000	5014000	the international law changed
5014000	5016000	the legal operation
5016000	5018000	and the domestic politics of the Republic of China.
5018000	5020000	I think
5020000	5022000	under the example of an
5022000	5024000	international law,
5024000	5026000	we should consider
5026000	5028000	the level of economics,
5028000	5030000	politics,
5030000	5032000	and social science.
5032000	5034000	Under such conditions,
5034000	5036000	how will it affect
5036000	5038000	the reasoning,
5038000	5040000	logic,
5040000	5042000	and interpretation of the law?
5042000	5044000	What should we pay attention to
5044000	5046000	in the future
5046000	5048000	when there are
5048000	5050000	relevant systems
5050000	5052000	of international law?
5052000	5054000	I will try to convince him
5054000	5056000	that these are important backgrounds.
5056000	5058000	Your second question
5058000	5060000	is that
5060000	5062000	I think in the near future,
5062000	5064000	the international law
5064000	5066000	will certainly strengthen
5066000	5068000	the national boundary.
5068000	5070000	It is like
5070000	5072000	decoupling.
5072000	5074000	For example,
5074000	5076000	when foreigners enter Taiwan,
5076000	5078000	they need to have
5078000	5080000	a negative vaccination certificate.
5080000	5082000	I do not need it
5082000	5084000	because I have a passport from the Republic of China.
5084000	5086000	At this time,
5086000	5088000	there is a difference
5088000	5090000	between you and me.
5090000	5092000	If I see someone
5092000	5094000	who owes money like me
5094000	5096000	but he is subject to legal jurisdiction
5096000	5098000	and the law he uses is different,
5098000	5100000	this kind of
5100000	5102000	internal and external distinction
5102000	5104000	will strengthen
5104000	5106000	our imagination
5106000	5108000	and views.
5108000	5110000	I think the international law
5110000	5112000	plays an important role
5112000	5114000	in the modernization
5114000	5116000	of China.
5116000	5118000	Thank you.
5120000	5122000	Thank you.
5122000	5124000	Thank you.
5126000	5128000	Do you have any questions?
5128000	5130000	I think
5130000	5132000	both the speech
5132000	5134000	and the Q&A are wonderful.
5136000	5138000	Thank you.
5144000	5146000	Excuse me,
5146000	5148000	can I ask a question?
5148000	5150000	Go ahead.
5150000	5152000	I am from Indiana.
5152000	5154000	I am studying information science,
5154000	5156000	which is the term used in Taiwan.
5156000	5158000	I have studied history,
5158000	5160000	so I know a little bit about history.
5160000	5162000	I am curious about
5162000	5164000	legal pluralism and
5164000	5166000	international law.
5166000	5168000	Although there are
5168000	5170000	different contexts,
5170000	5172000	for example,
5172000	5174000	in the past,
5174000	5176000	the rule of law
5176000	5178000	of the colonial motherland
5178000	5180000	was different but equal.
5180000	5182000	In fact,
5182000	5184000	it is not equal.
5184000	5186000	Is there any possibility
5186000	5188000	that the same concept
5188000	5190000	exists in the dispute
5190000	5192000	of international law?
5192000	5194000	Is it the same
5194000	5196000	as the rule of law?
5196000	5198000	If I remember correctly,
5198000	5200000	it is the same as the rule of law.
5200000	5202000	There are many questions.
5202000	5204000	The first one is
5204000	5206000	the dispute between the rule of law
5206000	5208000	and the national security law.
5208000	5210000	In fact,
5210000	5212000	not only China implemented
5212000	5214000	the national security law in Hong Kong,
5214000	5216000	Taiwan also discussed
5216000	5218000	whether to implement a national security law.
5218000	5220000	It may already exist,
5220000	5222000	but I wonder
5222000	5224000	if there is a common origin
5224000	5226000	or a common core
5226000	5228000	in the dispute.
5234000	5236000	The last one is
5236000	5238000	if you know that
5238000	5240000	you have to study history for seven years,
5240000	5242000	do you still want to study
5242000	5244000	a doctor of law?
5244000	5246000	After you finish studying history,
5246000	5248000	you can teach me in the history department.
5248000	5250000	Do you think that
5250000	5252000	the law history of the U.S.
5252000	5254000	is a more
5254000	5256000	inclusive direction
5256000	5258000	under the system
5258000	5260000	of the U.S. Law School?
5260000	5262000	There are many questions.
5262000	5264000	You can pick the key answer.
5264000	5266000	Thank you.
5270000	5272000	The first one is
5272000	5274000	the issue of multilateralism
5274000	5276000	and colonization
5276000	5278000	of the United States.
5278000	5280000	The term
5280000	5282000	multilateralism
5282000	5284000	originated
5284000	5286000	from the study
5286000	5288000	of the Great British Empire.
5288000	5290000	The Great British Empire
5290000	5292000	was famous
5292000	5294000	for its
5294000	5296000	high regard
5296000	5298000	for local officials
5298000	5300000	in every colony.
5300000	5302000	In 1895,
5302000	5304000	when the Japanese ruled Taiwan,
5304000	5306000	they did not use the Japanese Civil Code
5306000	5308000	or the Civil Code.
5308000	5310000	Taiwanese used old customs.
5310000	5312000	It was not until 1900
5312000	5314000	that it became a local colonization.
5316000	5318000	The recent study of the empire
5318000	5320000	in the history department
5320000	5322000	is very popular.
5322000	5324000	It re-evaluates
5324000	5326000	the methods of governance
5326000	5328000	of the previous empires,
5328000	5330000	such as Rome and China,
5330000	5332000	to see whether
5332000	5334000	the British Empire
5334000	5336000	did the same thing.
5336000	5338000	The British Empire
5338000	5340000	was well-known
5340000	5342000	for its multilateralism.
5342000	5344000	In Hong Kong,
5344000	5346000	it used the old customs
5346000	5348000	as a part of the United States' law.
5354000	5356000	My main question is
5356000	5358000	whether there is
5358000	5360000	such a situation
5360000	5362000	in the history department.
5368000	5370000	I think
5370000	5372000	foreign law
5372000	5374000	gives people
5374000	5376000	an impression that
5376000	5378000	foreign law is biased.
5378000	5380000	However,
5380000	5382000	foreign law
5382000	5384000	seems to cause
5384000	5386000	people to use
5386000	5388000	different laws
5388000	5390000	to achieve
5390000	5392000	unequal results.
5396000	5398000	Yes,
5398000	5400000	this is our impression
5400000	5402000	of foreign law.
5402000	5404000	However,
5404000	5406000	I am not sure
5406000	5408000	about this.
5408000	5410000	Last December,
5410000	5412000	I went to
5412000	5414000	the Second National Archives
5414000	5416000	in Maryland.
5416000	5418000	There were 10 boxes
5418000	5420000	of documents.
5420000	5422000	One of the things
5422000	5424000	I want to do
5424000	5426000	is to look through
5426000	5428000	these documents
5428000	5430000	and do some coding
5430000	5432000	and quantification analysis
5432000	5434000	to see whether
5434000	5436000	foreign law
5436000	5438000	is biased against Americans.
5438000	5440000	I don't think
5440000	5442000	there is such a situation
5442000	5444000	in Shanghai.
5444000	5446000	I think
5446000	5448000	this is a matter
5448000	5450000	of fact.
5450000	5452000	We need more evidence.
5452000	5454000	The second question is
5454000	5456000	why it was in 1868.
5456000	5458000	I think
5458000	5460000	the Tongchi Restoration
5460000	5462000	was established
5462000	5464000	by the
5464000	5466000	Tongchi Center.
5466000	5468000	After the Fourth War,
5468000	5470000	it sent more students
5470000	5472000	to Europe and America.
5472000	5474000	They began to
5474000	5476000	learn more about
5476000	5478000	the concept of
5478000	5480000	sovereignty and
5480000	5482000	modern international law.
5482000	5484000	They realized that
5484000	5486000	Europeans used
5486000	5488000	the label
5488000	5490000	of an uncivilized country
5490000	5492000	to label China.
5492000	5494000	The first person
5494000	5496000	who opposed it was
5496000	5498000	Guo Songtao.
5498000	5500000	He went to Europe
5500000	5502000	and became
5502000	5504000	a member of the
5504000	5506000	Tongchi Restoration.
5506000	5508000	There were many
5508000	5510000	religious crimes.
5510000	5512000	One of the crimes
5512000	5514000	was that Chinese people
5514000	5516000	destroyed churches
5516000	5518000	and killed missionaries.
5518000	5520000	Why did this happen?
5520000	5522000	In many cases,
5522000	5524000	it was because
5524000	5526000	a Chinese person
5526000	5528000	believed in Christianity.
5528000	5530000	The missionaries
5530000	5532000	applied for foreign passports.
5532000	5534000	For example,
5534000	5536000	British and French passports.
5536000	5538000	Later,
5538000	5540000	many Chinese people
5540000	5542000	enjoyed foreign law
5542000	5544000	and committed crimes.
5544000	5546000	This led to dissatisfaction
5546000	5548000	among the local people.
5548000	5550000	The grassroots people
5550000	5552000	began to think that
5552000	5554000	there was a lot of
5554000	5556000	injustice in it.
5556000	5558000	If you look at the documents
5558000	5560000	of the Xiamen Consulate,
5560000	5562000	you can see that
5562000	5564000	Taiwanese also enjoyed
5564000	5566000	foreign law in China in 1895.
5566000	5568000	Many people
5568000	5570000	from Chaozhou
5570000	5572000	went to Singapore
5572000	5574000	and obtained passports
5574000	5576000	from the British Empire.
5576000	5578000	When they came back to China
5578000	5580000	to do business,
5580000	5582000	they advocated foreign law.
5582000	5584000	Many defendants
5584000	5586000	are still being investigated.
5586000	5588000	What is their intention?
5588000	5590000	Isn't it normal for a person
5590000	5592000	to have two passports?
5592000	5594000	I don't understand
5594000	5596000	why so many Taiwanese
5596000	5598000	have two passports.
5600000	5602000	If everyone in Taiwan
5602000	5604000	has foreign law,
5604000	5606000	how can he have foreign law?
5606000	5608000	Next,
5608000	5610000	the issue of national security law
5610000	5612000	and foreign law.
5612000	5614000	As I mentioned earlier,
5614000	5616000	I think Hong Kong
5616000	5618000	is like a
5618000	5620000	legal multidimensional state
5620000	5622000	to the People's Republic of China.
5622000	5624000	However,
5624000	5626000	it is a problem
5626000	5628000	whether a modern country
5628000	5630000	can tolerate
5630000	5632000	legal multidimensionality.
5636000	5638000	I think the common cause
5638000	5640000	is to expand
5640000	5642000	the judicial sovereignty
5642000	5644000	at the core of a sovereign state.
5644000	5646000	Therefore,
5646000	5648000	there are many exceptions
5648000	5650000	in the national security law.
5650000	5652000	For example,
5652000	5654000	Taiwan's jurisdiction
5654000	5656000	and so on.
5656000	5658000	This is an interesting question.
5658000	5660000	I haven't figured it out yet.
5660000	5662000	I will share the results
5662000	5664000	with you later.
5664000	5666000	I'm looking forward to it.
5666000	5668000	The last one is
5668000	5670000	about teaching.
5670000	5672000	This is an interesting question.
5672000	5674000	I'm studying
5674000	5676000	the history of Sino-US relations,
5676000	5678000	but it doesn't mean
5678000	5680000	I'm going to teach Sino-US relations
5680000	5682000	in law school.
5682000	5684000	For example,
5684000	5686000	a well-known American
5686000	5688000	tax law teacher
5688000	5690000	teaches law school
5690000	5692000	in Michigan.
5692000	5694000	He is a Harvard History PhD
5694000	5696000	and a Harvard JD.
5696000	5698000	PhDs need to have
5698000	5700000	academic training,
5700000	5702000	such as writing papers
5702000	5704000	and publishing papers,
5704000	5706000	and have a good background in knowledge.
5706000	5708000	In the end,
5708000	5710000	what you teach in law school
5710000	5712000	actually depends on
5712000	5714000	the field of representation
5714000	5716000	when you apply for a job.
5722000	5724000	Of course, it is difficult
5724000	5726000	to find a good teacher
5726000	5728000	in law school.
5728000	5730000	In fact,
5730000	5732000	American law schools
5732000	5734000	are very special.
5734000	5736000	In history,
5736000	5738000	I know that
5738000	5740000	a law school
5740000	5742000	rents a whole hotel
5742000	5744000	in Washington DC
5744000	5746000	every December,
5746000	5748000	and 200 law schools
5748000	5750000	in the United States
5750000	5752000	recruit new teachers.
5752000	5754000	So every year,
5754000	5756000	there is a shortage of
5756000	5758000	law school teachers.
5758000	5760000	I heard that
5760000	5762000	there is a teacher
5762000	5764000	who has never been
5764000	5766000	fully recruited
5766000	5768000	in the United States.
5768000	5770000	I read a lot of
5770000	5772000	tax law books
5772000	5774000	because I thought
5774000	5776000	it would be easier to find a job
5776000	5778000	in law school.
5778000	5780000	In fact,
5780000	5782000	law school teachers
5782000	5784000	are very realistic.
5784000	5786000	If you want to be fully recruited,
5786000	5788000	your CV must be
5788000	5790000	in a fixed format.
5790000	5792000	In the Northwest,
5792000	5794000	a law school teacher
5794000	5796000	told me that
5796000	5798000	I should print out
5798000	5800000	the blank form of my CV
5800000	5802000	and put it under my desk.
5802000	5804000	Every year,
5804000	5806000	I should reflect on
5806000	5808000	which part of my CV
5808000	5810000	that I should print out.
5810000	5812000	So,
5812000	5814000	after reading for so long,
5814000	5816000	should I continue to read?
5816000	5818000	In fact,
5818000	5820000	most people suggest
5820000	5822000	that I should finish
5822000	5824000	my 5-year history course
5824000	5826000	and finish my PhD
5826000	5828000	by the fifth year.
5828000	5830000	I should finish my PhD
5830000	5832000	by the seventh year
5832000	5834000	and finish my PhD
5834000	5836000	by the eighth year
5836000	5838000	and finish my PhD.
5838000	5840000	In the U.S.,
5840000	5842000	if you want to teach
5842000	5844000	in a law school,
5844000	5846000	you need two years of experience.
5846000	5848000	So, I should graduate from J.D.
5848000	5850000	and become a lawyer in the U.S.
5850000	5852000	and then apply for a job
5852000	5854000	in a law school.
5854000	5856000	Law school teachers
5856000	5858000	apply for a job
5858000	5860000	before 40 years old.
5860000	5862000	So, I should finish my PhD
5862000	5864000	and become a lawyer
5864000	5866000	so that I can apply for a job in a law school.
5866000	5868000	That's all.
5868000	5870000	Thank you so much.
5870000	5872000	Thank you.
5872000	5874000	But,
5874000	5876000	there is an interesting point.
5876000	5878000	Why are tax lawyers always dissatisfied?
5878000	5880000	Because
5880000	5882000	tax lawyers in the U.S. make a lot of money.
5882000	5884000	After being a tax lawyer for two years,
5884000	5886000	many people don't want to come back
5886000	5888000	to apply for a job.
5888000	5890000	They make a lot of money.
5890000	5892000	After all,
5892000	5894000	a tax lawyer needs two years of experience.
5894000	5896000	So,
5896000	5898000	the more money you make, the less people want to apply for a job.
5898000	5900000	That's true.
5900000	5902000	Just like C.S. is always looking for a teacher.
5902000	5904000	That's right.
5904000	5906000	And,
5906000	5908000	C.S. doesn't force you to have a lot of experience.
5908000	5910000	In law school,
5910000	5912000	you need to be a lawyer for two years before applying for a job.
5912000	5914000	So, some people are very happy
5914000	5916000	and apply for a job right away.
5916000	5918000	It's like your love for law school.
5918000	5920000	Law school is your true love.
5920000	5922000	That's right.
5926000	5928000	Because of time constraints,
5928000	5930000	as a host,
5930000	5932000	I'd like to ask C.S.
5932000	5934000	for a final answer.
5934000	5936000	Because this is a projectile speech,
5936000	5938000	whether it's
5938000	5940000	the audience
5940000	5942000	here today or
5942000	5944000	in the future,
5944000	5946000	I guess most of the people watching this video
5946000	5948000	are Taiwanese.
5948000	5950000	I'd like to ask C.S.
5950000	5952000	to tell us
5952000	5954000	about your research
5954000	5956000	and how you connect with people
5956000	5958000	from different backgrounds
5958000	5960000	and fields.
5960000	5962000	Okay.
5966000	5968000	I think
5968000	5970000	Taiwan is Taiwan,
5970000	5972000	but it's different
5972000	5974000	from China.
5974000	5976000	I think
5976000	5978000	the legacy of the Republic of China
5978000	5980000	has a great impact,
5980000	5982000	especially on the law.
5982000	5984000	Our Civil Law and Criminal Law
5984000	5986000	were established during the administration period.
5986000	5988000	The main purpose of the Civil Law
5988000	5990000	and Criminal Law in Taiwan
5990000	5992000	at that time was to complete
5992000	5994000	the modernization of the law
5994000	5996000	and abolish foreign law.
5996000	5998000	So we still have a lot of legacy,
5998000	6000000	such as the LinkedIn case
6000000	6002000	or the Judiciary.
6002000	6004000	I always think
6004000	6006000	that we need to understand
6008000	6010000	the law of the Republic of China
6010000	6012000	in the mainland
6012000	6014000	in order to better understand
6014000	6016000	the law we use in Taiwan.
6016000	6018000	You need to understand
6018000	6020000	why the Republic of China
6020000	6022000	has such a law,
6022000	6024000	and its bigger background
6024000	6026000	is the contact
6026000	6028000	between the Qing and the West.
6028000	6030000	From a legal perspective,
6030000	6032000	the biggest problem
6032000	6034000	is that the Qing Empire,
6034000	6036000	the Beiyang Government,
6036000	6038000	Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek,
6038000	6040000	and the Communist Party of China
6040000	6042000	all want to abolish
6042000	6044000	foreign law.
6044000	6046000	However,
6046000	6048000	because of this political context,
6048000	6050000	we have a lot of misunderstandings
6050000	6052000	about foreign law
6052000	6054000	and a lot of democracy.
6054000	6056000	So I think
6056000	6058000	this kind of research
6058000	6060000	can be done
6060000	6062000	and we can
6062000	6064000	reflect on
6064000	6066000	what it means to us,
6066000	6068000	develop more theories,
6068000	6070000	take off our democracy glasses,
6070000	6072000	and re-understand
6072000	6074000	the background of the law
6074000	6076000	we use in Taiwan.
6076000	6078000	I think
6078000	6080000	this is what I want to do.
6082000	6084000	I think it's super exciting.
6084000	6086000	As someone
6086000	6088000	who used to teach
6088000	6090000	at a law school,
6090000	6092000	now I'm a PhD student
6092000	6094000	in different fields
6094000	6096000	of law.
6096000	6098000	I'm looking forward
6098000	6100000	to your future
6100000	6102000	in history,
6102000	6104000	and your
6104000	6106000	PhD career.
6106000	6108000	I also hope that
6108000	6110000	you can overcome
6110000	6112000	your eight-year PhD life
6112000	6114000	and get two J.D. and Ph.D.
6114000	6116000	and become
6116000	6118000	the first person
6118000	6120000	at a law school.
6120000	6122000	Thank you for your time today.
6122000	6124000	I'm going to end
6124000	6126000	the meeting now.
6126000	6128000	After the recording,
6128000	6130000	you can share your thoughts
6130000	6132000	with your friends and family.
6132000	6134000	Welcome, Mingxi.
6134000	6136000	We look forward to your research.
6136000	6138000	Thank you, Yiyan.
6138000	6140000	Thank you.
6140000	6142000	Bye-bye.
6146000	6148000	I'm going to end the meeting now.
6148000	6150000	After the recording,
6150000	6152000	you can share your thoughts
6152000	6154000	with your friends and family.
6154000	6156000	Thank you, Yiyan.
6156000	6158000	Bye-bye.
6176000	6178000	Thank you, Yiyan.
