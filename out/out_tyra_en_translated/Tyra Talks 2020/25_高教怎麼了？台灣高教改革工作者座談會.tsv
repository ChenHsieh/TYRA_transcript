0	10000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the summer special series activities of Taira at the end of September.
10000	16000	This year's summer special series activities are a bit long. We will actually extend it to October.
16000	22000	Today's topic is called, what's wrong with high-profile, high-profile reform workers forum.
22000	33000	We are very honored to invite three speakers from different perspectives and fields to talk about high-profile reform for a long time.
33000	39000	The first thing I want to do is to introduce our speakers to you.
39000	50000	Our first speaker is Dr. Chen Xiaoyu. He is currently a vice-researcher at the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy Research and Information Center.
50000	57000	He is also a member of the Taiwan High-Level Educational Industry Association.
57000	63000	The second speaker is Dr. Xu Ruifu. He is currently a doctoral student at the Taiwan University Telecommunications Institute.
63000	68000	He was the president of the former Taiwan University Graduate Association.
68000	72000	At the same time, he is also a youth consultant member of the Executive Yuan.
72000	80000	He has been very active in participating in high-profile reform, especially from a student's point of view.
80000	82000	The third speaker is Dr. Xie Ruizhe.
82000	84000	But we may not call him that today.
84000	86000	Because everyone is used to calling him Zha Shi.
86000	88000	So we may also call him Zha Shi.
88000	90000	You can also call him that.
90000	94000	He is now the policy assistant of the Legislative Yuan Educational and Cultural Committee.
94000	98000	So he can also bring you different points of view in this regard.
98000	100000	I will not mention it again today.
100000	102000	But let me talk about it first.
102000	107000	Today's three speakers, their bosses are very willing to let them share.
107000	111000	But based on their experience, they will speak on behalf of themselves.
111000	113000	I will talk about it for them.
113000	115000	Okay.
115000	117000	So this is what we are going to do today.
117000	125000	We will invite the three speakers to talk about how they view the issue of high-profile reform.
125000	129000	Then we can start discussing from what they have said.
129000	133000	Let's start with Xiaoyu.
133000	135000	How do you view this issue?
137000	139000	Okay. I am Xiaoyu Chen.
139000	141000	Thank you for the invitation.
141000	145000	And thank you to the other two speakers, Ruizhe and Zha Shi, for their participation.
145000	147000	When it comes to high-profile reform,
147000	151000	I dare not say that I have been involved in reform for many years.
151000	155000	I basically want to share some observations on high-level education.
155000	157000	Okay.
157000	159000	My interest in research is mainly high-level education.
159000	161000	I also read this in my class.
161000	165000	The topic I want to talk about today is about high-level talents.
165000	167000	If you have seen my Facebook page,
167000	169000	which is LaoYuNanJie,
169000	171000	I have a fan page.
171000	175000	I often write on it that Taiwan issues are global issues.
175000	181000	But we also have different domestic issues that need to be discussed.
181000	185000	I cut from three perspectives of human resources management.
185000	187000	The first is the part about talent selection.
187000	191000	In fact, my country's current problem of doctoral education,
191000	195000	I personally think that it is not that no one reads doctoral classes,
195000	199000	but that excellent talents are not willing to read doctoral classes.
199000	201000	That is the problem of our country.
201000	203000	Okay. This is the part about talent selection.
203000	205000	Everyone can discuss this later.
205000	207000	From the part about the budget and the budget flow,
207000	209000	I personally think that there are two things,
209000	211000	some things are worth discussing.
211000	213000	The first is the talent selection.
213000	215000	The first is the part about doctoral education.
215000	219000	What kind of doctoral education do we provide in China?
219000	221000	Do we treat everyone as paper machines,
221000	223000	lab workers,
223000	227000	or do we really need to train people to solve problems?
227000	229000	And then in the future,
229000	231000	I hope that the industry or the academic world
231000	233000	will develop more and more.
233000	235000	I think this is a very important issue.
235000	237000	I think this is a very important issue.
237000	239000	I think this is a very important issue.
239000	241000	I hope that the industry or the academic world
241000	243000	will develop more and more.
243000	245000	I hope that the industry or the academic world
245000	247000	will develop more and more.
247000	249000	Okay. The other problem is the mechanism.
249000	251000	The mechanism will be discussed by the other two speakers.
251000	253000	I personally think there are two parts.
253000	255000	One part is about the part about study abroad scholarship.
255000	257000	One part is about the part about study abroad scholarship.
257000	259000	The related planning and distribution of the field
259000	261000	is how to proceed.
261000	263000	The more serious problem for our domestic doctoral class
263000	265000	is that at present
265000	267000	the domestic doctoral class
267000	269000	only has the part about study abroad scholarship.
269000	271000	Whether you are a TA or an RA,
271000	273000	the education of the doctoral class
273000	275000	does not have the so-called scholarship system.
275000	277000	In other words,
277000	279000	we do not have the so-called fellowship.
279000	281000	The third part is
281000	283000	mainly about the flow of money.
283000	285000	The human resources management
285000	287000	likes to talk about the flow of money.
287000	289000	The part about the flow of money.
289000	291000	The part about the flow of money.
291000	293000	My personal opinion is that
293000	295000	whether you are a senior talent,
295000	297000	a doctoral talent,
297000	299000	an academic talent,
299000	301000	or an industrial talent,
301000	303000	in other words,
303000	305000	if you want to develop into the academic world
305000	307000	or the industry,
307000	309000	basically,
309000	311000	the mechanism of the talent
311000	313000	is a part of the global flow.
313000	315000	Regardless of which university you graduate from,
315000	317000	or which direction you want to go in the future,
317000	319000	for example,
319000	321000	if you want to go to a foreign university
321000	323000	or research institution
323000	325000	in the future,
325000	327000	I suggest that
327000	329000	we should think about
329000	331000	how to cooperate internationally in the future
331000	333000	and help these talents
333000	335000	to have a good development abroad.
335000	337000	If you want to come back to China,
337000	339000	whether it is a university,
339000	341000	research institution,
341000	343000	or industry development,
343000	345000	in fact,
345000	347000	we consider,
347000	349000	for example,
349000	351000	whether you apply for
351000	353000	a job in China,
353000	355000	to be honest,
355000	357000	in my personal experience,
357000	359000	if you really come back to China
359000	361000	and apply for a job in China
361000	363000	or do research,
363000	365000	of course money is a very important factor,
365000	367000	but money can never
367000	369000	solve all the problems.
369000	371000	In fact,
371000	373000	we need more related support,
373000	375000	for example,
375000	377000	for young scholars.
377000	379000	In fact,
379000	381000	if you want to
381000	383000	enter the industry,
383000	385000	my personal opinion is that
385000	387000	in fact, there are many doctors in Taiwan
387000	389000	and there are many questions related to
389000	391000	Dr. Liu Lang.
391000	393000	Basically, if you can pass the doctorate exam,
393000	395000	you basically have a certain
395000	397000	ability or a certain degree.
397000	399000	My personal opinion is that
399000	401000	if you finish your doctorate,
401000	403000	you have to have a bottom line,
403000	405000	which is to know that
405000	407000	you may not be able to develop
407000	409000	as much as you want,
409000	411000	but you have a lot of things you can do.
411000	413000	Like me,
413000	415000	to be honest,
415000	417000	I am a Ph.D.
417000	419000	in the Department of Philosophy
419000	421000	at the National University of Private University.
421000	423000	To be honest,
423000	425000	we are the weakest group.
425000	427000	I graduated from the Department of Literature
427000	429000	and then I studied a doctorate,
429000	431000	but after I graduated,
431000	433000	I found that I could not
433000	435000	engage in teaching at all.
435000	437000	Even when I was laid off
437000	439000	from school for a while,
439000	441000	I was thinking that
441000	443000	there was no other possibility.
443000	445000	So my friends called me
445000	447000	a truck driver.
447000	449000	I have a driver's license
449000	451000	in Taiwan.
451000	453000	In other words,
453000	455000	if the school or my legal agency
455000	457000	doesn't want me,
457000	459000	I can find it the next day
459000	461000	and I can drive a bus right away.
461000	463000	We often joke that
463000	465000	the school or my legal agency
465000	467000	doesn't want me
467000	469000	because my colleagues
469000	471000	don't want me to hurt passers-by.
471000	473000	This is my report.
473000	475000	Thank you.
475000	477000	Let me summarize a little bit.
477000	479000	As Xiaoyu mentioned,
479000	481000	Taiwan has talented people,
481000	483000	but it seems that
483000	485000	there are very few people
485000	487000	who are willing to be a Ph.D.
487000	489000	Also,
489000	491000	Taiwan is obviously
491000	493000	without a Ph.D. system.
493000	495000	Thirdly,
495000	497000	we either have talented people
497000	499000	or they don't come back.
499000	501000	It seems that
501000	503000	somehow we don't have such a balance
503000	505000	to achieve such a fluid balance.
505000	507000	We can discuss this later.
507000	509000	Before we discuss,
509000	511000	let's change the order.
511000	513000	As Xiaoyu and Ruifu
513000	515000	just introduced,
515000	517000	let's have Zha Shi
517000	519000	to talk about
519000	521000	the reform of higher education.
521000	523000	Can you hear me?
523000	525000	Yes.
525000	527000	I'm Zha Shi.
527000	529000	Today, I'm going to
529000	531000	talk about something
531000	533000	that I don't understand.
533000	535000	After all, the Legislative Yuan
535000	537000	has to supervise the education committee
537000	539000	for a long time,
539000	541000	so I think the government
541000	543000	should do more.
543000	545000	What are these actions?
545000	547000	Today's audience
547000	549000	has a different point of view.
549000	551000	From the beginning,
551000	553000	I think the talent cultivation,
553000	555000	the ability to retain talents,
555000	557000	and the ability to retain talents
557000	559000	is a national security strategy.
559000	561000	I think everyone can accept this.
561000	563000	We all think
563000	565000	this is a national strategy,
565000	567000	but if more and more people
567000	569000	in Taiwan are missing
569000	571000	or unwilling to be a Ph.D.,
571000	573000	this is definitely a national security crisis.
573000	575000	From this perspective,
575000	577000	starting with the local Ph.D.,
577000	579000	we have indeed encountered
579000	581000	a lot of situations and problems.
581000	583000	But let's start
583000	585000	with a big vision.
585000	587000	If Taiwan wants to be
587000	589000	a country with international competitiveness
589000	591000	and global competitiveness,
591000	593000	first of all, our local Ph.D. students
593000	595000	like Xiaoyu said,
595000	597000	these excellent Ph.D. students are not willing to study.
597000	599000	This is definitely the first part of the problem
599000	601000	that we have to solve.
601000	603000	In fact, talents are not only
603000	605000	local talents, international talents,
605000	607000	and overseas talents
607000	609000	like you.
609000	611000	Can Taiwan do this?
611000	613000	Because we have been dealing with
613000	615000	an overseas study and
615000	617000	international education specialization.
617000	619000	This is related to
619000	621000	international education specialization.
621000	623000	To echo what Xiaoyu said,
623000	625000	many of our Ph.D. students
625000	627000	have a healthy
627000	629000	education plan system overseas.
629000	631000	This part allows us to
631000	633000	recruit more international students
633000	635000	in Taiwan.
635000	637000	We focus on Ph.D. students.
637000	639000	They have more planning resources
639000	641000	to go to the world
641000	643000	to have more international experience,
643000	645000	more international education experience.
645000	647000	But for Taiwan,
647000	649000	the last piece of the puzzle
649000	651000	is the new economic immigration law
651000	653000	that we did not finish
653000	655000	in the 9th session of the last meeting.
655000	657000	This is actually a lot of pieces.
657000	659000	Starting with local Ph.D. training,
659000	661000	this is very important.
661000	663000	Because I believe that many
663000	665000	academic professors
665000	667000	will have this goal
667000	669000	in the end.
669000	671000	So local Ph.D. training
671000	673000	is very important.
673000	675000	But in terms of international flow,
675000	677000	do we have such a healthy
677000	679000	international education
679000	681000	that allows everyone to
681000	683000	communicate internationally?
683000	685000	In the end, there is a very good
685000	687000	talent or flow policy,
687000	689000	which is our new economic immigration law.
689000	691000	We have been following it recently.
691000	693000	So I think this is a part of the
693000	695000	perspective to think about
695000	697000	every link is important.
697000	699000	But although every link is important,
699000	701000	I personally feel that
701000	703000	there is still very little
703000	705000	discussion on local Ph.D. training.
705000	707000	For me,
707000	709000	a local Ph.D. training
709000	711000	needs to have many important aspects.
711000	713000	The first is economic support.
713000	715000	We just talked about
715000	717000	a lot of Ph.D. students
717000	719000	have to get a two- or three-year Ph.D.
719000	721000	and have to work outside
721000	723000	to complete their research.
723000	725000	This is the first economic support.
725000	727000	Next,
727000	729000	is there a good training plan?
729000	731000	Whether it is in China,
731000	733000	there can be better
733000	735000	forward-looking academic research
735000	737000	or production planning
737000	739000	or to become a more practical Ph.D.
739000	741000	This is the second piece
741000	743000	that I think is very important.
743000	745000	The third piece is entry.
745000	747000	Whether it is to become
747000	749000	a forward-looking academic or a practical Ph.D.,
749000	751000	what is the government's
751000	753000	thinking in Taiwan?
753000	755000	I think this is an interesting part
755000	757000	that can be discussed.
757000	759000	From the government's point of view,
759000	761000	we have to deal with these things.
761000	763000	But which role in the government
763000	765000	is the most qualified
765000	767000	and should play
767000	769000	such a role?
769000	771000	In fact, what we see now is
771000	773000	that the national integration is very bad.
773000	775000	How do I put it?
775000	777000	For example, the Ministry of Education.
777000	779000	Of course, everyone will think that
779000	781000	all the questions we just talked about
781000	783000	are the Ministry of Education.
783000	785000	It has a huge responsibility.
785000	787000	But for the Ministry of Technology,
787000	789000	it also has a very important
789000	791000	responsibility to train
791000	793000	these senior talents
793000	795000	as a research talent.
795000	797000	Is the Ministry of Economy important?
797000	799000	If we are going to talk about
799000	801000	the important support for industry transformation,
801000	803000	is it important for the
803000	805000	connection between enterprises?
805000	807000	It is very important.
807000	809000	Next is the Ministry of Labor.
809000	811000	For these young graduates,
811000	813000	do they have a better way
813000	815000	to help them?
815000	817000	So we can actually know that
817000	819000	the issue of talent training
819000	821000	actually has a certain responsibility
821000	823000	in different departments.
823000	825000	Of course, the most important thing
825000	827000	is the Ministry of Education
827000	829000	When we do a lot of interviews,
829000	831000	we will find that the Ministry of Education
831000	833000	will do the Ministry of Education.
833000	835000	The Ministry of Technology will do the Ministry of Technology.
835000	837000	The connection between the ministries
837000	839000	is actually lacking.
839000	841000	Let me give you an example.
841000	843000	Last year, the Ministry of Technology
843000	845000	did an excellent doctoral student scholarship program.
845000	847000	Simply put,
847000	849000	it hopes to recruit many excellent talents
849000	851000	to Taiwan.
851000	853000	These students in Taiwan
853000	855000	are willing to study for a doctorate.
855000	857000	The Ministry of Technology
857000	859000	will give them about $500,000.
859000	861000	Of course, the Ministry of Technology
861000	863000	will cooperate with the universities.
863000	865000	But the Ministry of Technology
865000	867000	will provide the greatest assistance
867000	869000	in economic support.
869000	871000	This plan has been discussed for a long time.
871000	873000	The Ministry of Technology
873000	875000	has been looking for the Ministry of Education
875000	877000	to cooperate.
877000	879000	But in the end, the Ministry of Education
879000	881000	did not want to join.
881000	883000	The Ministry of Technology
883000	885000	is more likely to join
885000	887000	than the Ministry of Education.
887000	889000	The Ministry of Education
889000	891000	is more likely to join
891000	893000	than the Ministry of Technology.
893000	895000	The Ministry of Education
895000	897000	did not want to join.
897000	899000	This is a problem
899000	901000	that cannot be solved.
901000	903000	Sometimes, it cannot be solved
903000	905000	and it cannot cooperate.
905000	907000	Why?
907000	909000	In the Ministry of Education
909000	911000	or Ministry of Technology,
911000	913000	the Ministry of Education
913000	915000	is a single unit
915000	917000	in the constitutional system.
917000	919000	It has a budget
919000	921000	and it has to implement these plans every year.
921000	923000	The Ministry of Education
923000	925000	and the Ministry of Technology
925000	927000	are equal and respect each other.
927000	929000	Nobody can lead the other.
929000	931000	This is an interesting discussion.
931000	933000	In other countries,
933000	935000	the Ministry of Education
935000	937000	and the Ministry of Technology
937000	939000	are tied together.
939000	941000	When we do not have
941000	943000	a comprehensive strategy
943000	945000	for the country,
945000	947000	the Ministry of Education
947000	949000	seems to have only completed half of the plan.
949000	951000	The Ministry of Technology
951000	953000	seems to have only completed the other half.
953000	955000	But can these two ministries cooperate?
955000	957000	This is a big question mark.
957000	959000	We will try to push them.
959000	961000	But after all,
961000	963000	the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Technology
963000	965000	have a strong fundamentalism.
965000	967000	So many plans
967000	969000	will not meet.
969000	971000	So I think
971000	973000	from the biggest point of view,
973000	975000	I think the local
975000	977000	or international
977000	979000	or overseas talents
979000	981000	come back to Taiwan.
981000	983000	This is what our government
983000	985000	needs to complete
985000	987000	through some legal procedures.
987000	989000	But gradually,
989000	991000	in fact,
991000	993000	there are some problems
993000	995000	in the division of labor.
995000	997000	The Ministry of Education
997000	999000	does not do this.
999000	1001000	This is because it is called the Ministry of Labor
1001000	1003000	in the system.
1003000	1005000	The Ministry of Labor has its own restrictions.
1005000	1007000	So there is a lot of support
1007000	1009000	that has been talking about
1009000	1011000	whether the Ministry of Education
1011000	1013000	and the Ministry of Technology
1013000	1015000	can be combined.
1015000	1017000	Or is there a higher unit,
1017000	1019000	such as the National Development Committee?
1019000	1021000	This kind of high-level ministry
1021000	1023000	can do the integration of the ministries.
1023000	1025000	The plan of the ministries
1025000	1027000	really has its similarities.
1027000	1029000	Where is the integration?
1029000	1031000	How to do it?
1031000	1033000	I think this is a very interesting part.
1033000	1035000	So from the point of view
1035000	1037000	of government supervision,
1037000	1039000	this is probably the part I mentioned today.
1039000	1041000	Thank you.
1041000	1043000	I think this is very interesting.
1043000	1045000	That is to say,
1045000	1047000	let's find another person
1047000	1049000	to talk to you.
1049000	1051000	Let's ask Ralph to talk about it.
1051000	1053000	He used to be the president
1053000	1055000	of the Taiwan University Graduate Association.
1055000	1057000	Then he was a youth consultant
1057000	1059000	at the Executive Yuan.
1059000	1061000	Of course, now he is also a PhD student
1061000	1063000	doing TA and receiving scholarships.
1063000	1065000	Ralph, what do you think?
1065000	1067000	What is your opinion?
1067000	1069000	Let me post my Facebook first.
1069000	1071000	You can talk to me later.
1071000	1073000	Because I often
1073000	1075000	write articles or have some new plans.
1075000	1077000	If I have a chance,
1077000	1079000	I would like to find everyone to do it together.
1079000	1081000	Let me briefly talk about
1081000	1083000	the whole process and the path of participation.
1083000	1085000	There may be more issues
1085000	1087000	to be discussed later.
1087000	1089000	I think this experience is very important.
1089000	1091000	Because I have always been
1091000	1093000	participating from a student's point of view.
1093000	1095000	Then I saw the first line of the problem
1095000	1097000	and thought about how to change it.
1097000	1099000	I started to participate
1099000	1101000	in 2016.
1101000	1103000	At that time, I was recommended
1103000	1105000	to join the Executive Yuan Youth Consultation Committee.
1105000	1107000	Why is there this organization?
1107000	1109000	It is because
1109000	1111000	in 2014,
1111000	1113000	after the Taiyanghua School,
1113000	1115000	the government slowly realized
1115000	1117000	that the voice of the youth is very important.
1117000	1119000	In addition to social movements,
1119000	1121000	the government
1121000	1123000	established a youth consultation committee
1123000	1125000	and held a public election.
1125000	1127000	Later, after Tsai Ing-wen came to power,
1127000	1129000	she slightly changed her approach.
1129000	1131000	Because they felt that
1131000	1133000	many of the youth consultants
1133000	1135000	wanted to directly participate in politics and elections.
1135000	1137000	They felt that this approach
1137000	1139000	was not OK.
1139000	1141000	In practice, they became conservative.
1141000	1143000	They changed their approach
1143000	1145000	to let the officials of the committee recommend them.
1145000	1147000	Of course, the recommended candidates
1147000	1149000	are conservative,
1149000	1151000	but there are also some more advanced candidates.
1151000	1153000	So in practice,
1153000	1155000	it is more like
1155000	1157000	the committee has some policies that have been implemented.
1157000	1159000	Then you can make some amendments on it.
1159000	1161000	In fact, it is not possible
1161000	1163000	for example, at that time,
1163000	1165000	you can take any action.
1165000	1167000	At that time,
1167000	1169000	I was in office for two years.
1169000	1171000	It happened to be the time when
1171000	1173000	my research institute was in its first year.
1173000	1175000	I proposed two proposals.
1175000	1177000	It happened to be in the office of Lin Quan and Lai Ching-teh.
1177000	1179000	One of the proposals
1179000	1181000	was aimed at
1181000	1183000	some of the problems
1183000	1185000	in TA.
1185000	1187000	After the proposal,
1187000	1189000	the problem was not solved.
1189000	1191000	The second proposal
1191000	1193000	happened to be the opportunity
1193000	1195000	for UCLA scholars
1195000	1197000	to visit us.
1197000	1199000	I think the cooperation experience
1199000	1201000	of international research and academic exchange
1201000	1203000	is very important for an academic talent.
1203000	1205000	So I asked
1205000	1207000	if we should encourage more scholars
1207000	1209000	in our research institute.
1209000	1211000	Maybe it's not just a collaboration
1211000	1213000	with the teacher.
1213000	1215000	It is to let students have more research experience
1215000	1217000	and expand their international vision.
1217000	1219000	There are also some opportunities for international development.
1219000	1221000	Although the proposal was approved,
1221000	1223000	the result was not ideal.
1223000	1225000	The reason is that
1225000	1227000	about 80% to 90% of the content
1227000	1229000	was written
1229000	1231000	by the Ministry of Science and Technology
1231000	1233000	and the Ministry of Education.
1233000	1235000	They wrote an article
1235000	1237000	and replied to me.
1237000	1239000	The result of not communicating
1239000	1241000	is more like
1241000	1243000	you not only need to know
1243000	1245000	what they have done
1245000	1247000	in advance,
1247000	1249000	but also need to point out
1249000	1251000	which part of what they have done
1251000	1253000	is problematic
1253000	1255000	and they are willing to accept
1255000	1257000	what you have said.
1257000	1259000	It's not just that you may see
1259000	1261000	a problem from the outside
1261000	1263000	and think how to solve it
1263000	1265000	would be better.
1265000	1267000	Next, I will talk about the second part.
1267000	1269000	In that period of time,
1269000	1271000	I have a conclusion,
1271000	1273000	observation or summary.
1273000	1275000	If a problem can be improved,
1275000	1277000	there may be three motivations
1277000	1279000	or three reasons.
1279000	1281000	The first one is the government official.
1281000	1283000	The government official is the minister,
1283000	1285000	so he may not be able to achieve
1285000	1287000	what he wants to do.
1287000	1289000	But the will and choice of the government official
1289000	1291000	are very important.
1291000	1293000	The second one is the civil society.
1293000	1295000	The civil society is not only
1295000	1297000	publicizing information
1297000	1299000	or giving actual consultations.
1299000	1301000	For example,
1301000	1303000	Xiao Yu and Zha Shi
1303000	1305000	are the representatives of the civil society.
1305000	1307000	The pressure of the civil society
1307000	1309000	should be combined
1309000	1311000	through private meetings
1311000	1313000	or public speeches
1313000	1315000	to make people pay more attention.
1315000	1317000	This is also a very important way.
1317000	1319000	After that,
1319000	1321000	I had no choice
1321000	1323000	but to choose
1323000	1325000	the president of the Taiwan University Research Association.
1325000	1327000	In the position of president,
1327000	1329000	I have done
1329000	1331000	two things
1331000	1333000	for the Taiwan University Research Association.
1333000	1335000	First,
1335000	1337000	I had a meeting with the president
1337000	1339000	of the Taiwan University Research Association
1339000	1341000	and the director of the Ministry of Education
1341000	1343000	to discuss the improvement
1343000	1345000	of the student's treatment.
1345000	1347000	In fact,
1347000	1349000	the meeting was not very pleasant.
1349000	1351000	At that time,
1351000	1353000	we raised some issues
1353000	1355000	that we observed.
1355000	1357000	At that time,
1357000	1359000	we were not mature enough
1359000	1361000	to point out what he did wrong
1361000	1363000	and figure out how to solve the problem
1363000	1365000	and convince him.
1365000	1367000	We were not mature enough.
1367000	1369000	However,
1369000	1371000	some senior officials asked us
1371000	1373000	that if doctors
1373000	1375000	are unemployed
1375000	1377000	and unable to work,
1377000	1379000	we can easily invest more resources
1379000	1381000	instead of causing more unemployment.
1381000	1383000	Secondly,
1383000	1385000	how to convince the society
1385000	1387000	to invest more social resources
1387000	1389000	is really valuable.
1389000	1391000	Therefore,
1391000	1393000	the meeting was not pleasant.
1393000	1395000	At that time,
1395000	1397000	I observed
1397000	1399000	how to promote
1399000	1401000	the change of policy
1401000	1403000	to reduce the pressure of public opinion.
1403000	1405000	In the field of doctors,
1405000	1407000	there was a gap.
1407000	1409000	In the past,
1409000	1411000	there were many issues
1411000	1413000	about the student's point of view
1413000	1415000	at the Taiwan University Research Association
1415000	1417000	However,
1417000	1419000	the student's point of view
1419000	1421000	was always a problem.
1421000	1423000	For example,
1423000	1425000	the Taiwan University Research Association
1425000	1427000	had been promoting
1427000	1429000	the social movement
1429000	1431000	for 6 or 7 years
1431000	1433000	mainly for the employees
1433000	1435000	who had been working hard.
1435000	1437000	They made a lot of efforts
1437000	1439000	but I think
1439000	1441000	what they did
1441000	1443000	was meaningful.
1443000	1445000	First of all,
1445000	1447000	it was hard to continue
1447000	1449000	their movement.
1449000	1451000	Secondly,
1451000	1453000	the fundamental problem
1453000	1455000	was that the TA's salary
1455000	1457000	had not increased
1457000	1459000	from the 1930s to the present.
1459000	1461000	So,
1461000	1463000	it was a basic salary
1463000	1465000	of a supermarket.
1465000	1467000	This was a big problem.
1467000	1469000	It was the investment of social resources
1469000	1471000	rather than the calculation
1471000	1473000	Finally,
1473000	1475000	one of my goals
1475000	1477000	when I stay in Taiwan
1477000	1479000	is to improve the environment.
1479000	1481000	In the long run,
1481000	1483000	I hope that
1483000	1485000	the TA's education level
1485000	1487000	can be similar
1487000	1489000	to the higher education system
1489000	1491000	in the world.
1493000	1495000	No matter what,
1495000	1497000	it is important
1497000	1499000	to fulfill the TA's point of view.
1499000	1501000	According to our professors,
1501000	1503000	we need good researchers
1503000	1505000	and local academic development.
1505000	1507000	Whether it is academic development
1507000	1509000	or the development of industry,
1509000	1511000	we need these talents.
1511000	1513000	So,
1513000	1515000	it is important to
1515000	1517000	achieve a balance.
1517000	1519000	I am thinking about
1519000	1521000	organizing a national
1521000	1523000	TA's organization.
1523000	1525000	I hope that
1525000	1527000	we can continue to
1527000	1529000	organize it.
1529000	1531000	I will share more ideas with you later.
1531000	1533000	Thank you.
1535000	1537000	After hearing
1537000	1539000	the three
1539000	1541000	TA's statements,
1541000	1543000	we can hear
1543000	1545000	a clear
1545000	1547000	point of view.
1547000	1549000	Everyone mentioned
1549000	1551000	what is the role of a doctor?
1551000	1553000	What is the value of
1553000	1555000	cultivating these high-level talents?
1555000	1557000	If we understand it,
1557000	1559000	can we discuss
1559000	1561000	how to do it?
1561000	1563000	Then, the TA's
1563000	1565000	mentioned the resources.
1565000	1567000	After having the resources,
1567000	1569000	how can we
1569000	1571000	implement the policy?
1571000	1573000	Can we start from the beginning?
1573000	1575000	I will ask the three
1575000	1577000	TA's questions.
1577000	1579000	What do you think
1579000	1581000	the role of cultivating
1581000	1583000	these high-level talents
1583000	1585000	should be?
1585000	1587000	What is our
1587000	1589000	imagination?
1589000	1591000	Does anyone want to volunteer?
1591000	1593000	Sorry,
1593000	1595000	you can also
1595000	1597000	ask questions in the chat.
1597000	1599000	Let's go back
1599000	1601000	to the question.
1601000	1603000	I saw that
1603000	1605000	Xiao-Yu typed something.
1605000	1607000	Xiao-Yu, why don't you go first?
1607000	1609000	Not everyone can read the chat.
1609000	1611000	For example,
1611000	1613000	what do you think
1613000	1615000	the role of cultivating
1615000	1617000	these high-level talents
1617000	1619000	should be?
1621000	1623000	This is a difficult question.
1623000	1625000	I will go first.
1625000	1627000	Please.
1627000	1629000	Actually,
1629000	1631000	this question is also
1631000	1633000	to thank Zha Shi
1633000	1635000	after I graduated.
1635000	1637000	At that time,
1637000	1639000	I met him and he was
1639000	1641000	a professor.
1641000	1643000	I always felt that
1643000	1645000	Taiwan did not have a
1645000	1647000	continuous discussion
1647000	1649000	of high-level policy
1649000	1651000	and the power of continuous development.
1651000	1653000	Whether it was a group of French
1653000	1655000	or a political group
1655000	1657000	or various units.
1657000	1659000	At that time,
1659000	1661000	I met the biggest difficulty.
1661000	1663000	For example,
1663000	1665000	I was a doctor at
1665000	1667000	the University of Taiwan.
1667000	1669000	The power of continuous development
1669000	1671000	and innovation and transformation.
1671000	1673000	But this is not the case
1673000	1675000	in other fields.
1675000	1677000	Because the industrial development
1677000	1679000	is not the same
1679000	1681000	or there is no industry at all.
1681000	1683000	After I graduated from the master's class,
1683000	1685000	I did one thing.
1685000	1687000	I classified the three academic subjects
1687000	1689000	of the Department of Humanities and Social Science
1689000	1691000	in the Ministry of Education.
1691000	1693000	Then I found
1693000	1695000	the professors in these three fields.
1695000	1697000	According to their status,
1697000	1699000	they regularly
1699000	1701000	come to the Legislative Yuan
1701000	1703000	to discuss the direction
1703000	1705000	of policy development.
1705000	1707000	So this is really a more
1707000	1709000	top-level issue.
1709000	1711000	But I think
1711000	1713000	the other aspect of my talk
1713000	1715000	is that for this issue,
1715000	1717000	it is easy to limit
1717000	1719000	one's own learning experience
1719000	1721000	and one's own professional field.
1721000	1723000	So it becomes
1723000	1725000	more ideal
1725000	1727000	to have a more
1727000	1729000	top-level policy
1729000	1731000	of coordination and integration.
1731000	1733000	So I didn't directly answer this question,
1733000	1735000	but I just gave feedback on the other aspect.
1735000	1737000	Do you have any comments?
1737000	1739000	The other two.
1739000	1741000	Let me mention
1741000	1743000	because the Legislative Yuan
1743000	1745000	is held twice a year
1745000	1747000	in Taiwan.
1747000	1749000	Once is from February to May.
1749000	1751000	Once is from September to
1751000	1753000	the end of December.
1753000	1755000	This meeting is also called
1755000	1757000	the Budget Meeting of Taiwan.
1757000	1759000	We will start to review
1759000	1761000	the entire budget
1761000	1763000	proposed by the ministries
1763000	1765000	as a role of the Legislative Yuan.
1765000	1767000	So we normally have
1767000	1769000	a lot of discussions
1769000	1771000	with the Ministry of Education
1771000	1773000	about the budget report.
1773000	1775000	In this budget report,
1775000	1777000	all the ministers sit at the bottom.
1777000	1779000	In fact, I also asked directly.
1779000	1781000	This may be a very difficult question
1781000	1783000	and there is no standard answer.
1783000	1785000	What kind of talents
1785000	1787000	do we need to cultivate?
1787000	1789000	Is it a food type
1789000	1791000	or is it a front-line teacher?
1791000	1793000	What do we need to cultivate?
1793000	1795000	OK, then the head of the faculty
1795000	1797000	will talk first.
1797000	1799000	He said that as a main unit
1799000	1801000	of the faculty education,
1801000	1803000	we certainly hope that our faculty university
1803000	1805000	is a type of application
1805000	1807000	study.
1807000	1809000	Of course, if you want to study
1809000	1811000	a doctor,
1811000	1813000	we hope that they focus on
1813000	1815000	food type research.
1815000	1817000	OK, then the head of the faculty
1817000	1819000	will talk next.
1819000	1821000	We also know that
1821000	1823000	this is also a different faction.
1823000	1825000	Some people think that
1825000	1827000	it is a research faction and
1827000	1829000	some people think that
1829000	1831000	it is a food faction.
1831000	1833000	There are a lot of people
1833000	1835000	talking about this.
1835000	1837000	I myself am a lecturer
1837000	1839000	at the Institute of Electrical Engineering
1839000	1841000	with a background in technology.
1841000	1843000	So I also know that
1843000	1845000	today we are going to talk about
1845000	1847000	going to the workplace
1847000	1849000	and helping food companies.
1849000	1851000	This matter actually makes a lot of sense.
1851000	1853000	However, it is also because of the
1853000	1855000	many meetings we held together
1855000	1857000	at the University of瑞福,
1857000	1859000	we began to understand that
1859000	1861000	the doctoral students in the
1861000	1863000	humanities group and the social group
1863000	1865000	are completely different,
1865000	1867000	even none.
1867000	1869000	In this situation,
1869000	1871000	it is difficult for me to say
1871000	1873000	that I have always used the point of view
1873000	1875000	of technology.
1875000	1877000	In fact, it should be said
1877000	1879000	that from the point of view of the
1879000	1881000	government, I think that
1881000	1883000	it should be more responsible
1883000	1885000	to break down the humanities,
1885000	1887000	social science and technology,
1887000	1889000	even if the three groups are divided.
1889000	1891000	In fact, the different departments
1891000	1893000	are in technology.
1893000	1895000	For example, ecology,
1895000	1897000	one is a doctor of ecology,
1897000	1899000	and ecology and biology are completely different.
1899000	1901000	In fact, although it is just
1901000	1903000	such a standard under a big theme,
1903000	1905000	in fact, there are many
1905000	1907000	differences in each group.
1907000	1909000	So in fact, my own feeling is
1909000	1911000	that the government must have
1911000	1913000	sufficient height and policy resources.
1913000	1915000	It can go to the face.
1915000	1917000	The most ideal, of course,
1917000	1919000	is the science department in each field.
1919000	1921000	How much is the academic demand
1921000	1923000	at the academic end?
1923000	1925000	Will there be an industrial demand?
1925000	1927000	If these are all there,
1927000	1929000	it should be put back to the front end of education.
1929000	1931000	How do we do
1931000	1933000	a policy of recruiting students?
1933000	1935000	And of course, the other
1935000	1937000	part of the ideal is that for each student,
1937000	1939000	I believe that there must be students
1939000	1941000	who want to enter the enterprise to do industrial transformation,
1941000	1943000	do more experience in food.
1943000	1945000	There will also be these academic
1945000	1947000	research goals.
1947000	1949000	In fact, I think from the perspective of students,
1949000	1951000	how can they choose more freely?
1951000	1953000	Knowing that this choice
1953000	1955000	will have a job opportunity in the future,
1955000	1957000	but will there be a job opportunity?
1957000	1959000	I think the government
1959000	1961000	should take a
1961000	1963000	big responsibility to play.
1963000	1965000	But now we see that
1965000	1967000	it's more passive.
1967000	1969000	What do you use?
1969000	1971000	I'll cut your number
1971000	1973000	by less than the ratio of your recruitment.
1973000	1975000	Or say that our country has a key industry.
1975000	1977000	It seems that we want to develop these key industries,
1977000	1979000	so we come to add these positions.
1979000	1981000	But I think the most fundamental problem
1981000	1983000	is that it still takes a lot of time.
1983000	1985000	In this part, the government
1985000	1987000	should make more efforts.
1987000	1989000	The above is probably the case.
1991000	1993000	What do you think, Xiaoyu?
1993000	1995000	I think this is
1995000	1997000	a big problem.
1997000	1999000	In fact, this goes back to the policy.
1999000	2001000	In other words, is the high-level education
2001000	2003000	of our country a planned economy,
2003000	2005000	that is, government control,
2005000	2007000	or a free market?
2007000	2009000	If it is the United States,
2009000	2011000	to be honest, the doctoral program
2011000	2013000	is a free market.
2013000	2015000	In other words,
2015000	2017000	only graduate schools
2017000	2019000	can offer doctoral programs.
2019000	2021000	What kind of field or science
2021000	2023000	does the doctoral program provide?
2023000	2025000	In fact, it is mainly
2025000	2027000	dominated by various schools.
2027000	2029000	As for the job,
2029000	2031000	in my country,
2031000	2033000	we are actually under the control
2033000	2035000	of the Ministry of Education.
2035000	2037000	In this case,
2037000	2039000	what should we do?
2039000	2041000	How much should we do?
2041000	2043000	This matter is worth considering.
2043000	2045000	In other words,
2045000	2047000	of course, if you are a doctor,
2047000	2049000	you mainly want to
2049000	2051000	follow the academic path,
2051000	2053000	or want to develop the industry.
2053000	2055000	It is true that there are
2055000	2057000	social and scientific fields
2057000	2059000	that are not related
2059000	2061000	to the industry.
2061000	2063000	But in fact,
2063000	2065000	we have a lot of things to do.
2065000	2067000	So,
2067000	2069000	is the doctoral program
2069000	2071000	completely
2071000	2073000	aimed at the profession?
2073000	2075000	Or is it
2075000	2077000	still a basic ability
2077000	2079000	or a more professional ability
2079000	2081000	to hope to
2081000	2083000	move towards
2083000	2085000	long-term development in the future?
2085000	2087000	So,
2087000	2089000	this is actually
2089000	2091000	from a policy position.
2091000	2093000	So,
2093000	2095000	what should we do?
2095000	2097000	To what extent should we do?
2097000	2099000	Of course,
2099000	2101000	I also admit that
2101000	2103000	the relevant government,
2103000	2105000	whether it is the Ministry of Education,
2105000	2107000	the Ministry of Science and Technology,
2107000	2109000	or other units,
2109000	2111000	to be honest,
2111000	2113000	we are not fully equipped.
2113000	2115000	I actually heard you all say
2115000	2117000	that first of all,
2117000	2119000	there should be a policy
2119000	2121000	that is above the current level
2121000	2123000	of cross-departmental structure.
2123000	2125000	Or we should have a comprehensive strategy.
2125000	2127000	Let's put it this way.
2127000	2129000	And then to promote this strategy,
2129000	2131000	there is a very important one.
2131000	2133000	What kind of product
2133000	2135000	do we want to produce
2135000	2137000	to convince our government
2137000	2139000	to carry out what kind of policy
2139000	2141000	and then what kind of resources
2141000	2143000	do we need?
2143000	2145000	Do you have any practical ideas?
2145000	2147000	Of course, this is my ideal picture.
2147000	2149000	We can do this.
2149000	2151000	But do you have any experience?
2151000	2153000	Or do you have any
2153000	2155000	actual proposals?
2155000	2157000	Or any countries
2157000	2159000	have done this?
2159000	2161000	Or have you ever thought about it?
2161000	2163000	Or the government has actually done it,
2163000	2165000	but people have no feeling about it.
2165000	2167000	Or in fact,
2167000	2169000	do you have anything to share?
2171000	2173000	You are all very polite.
2173000	2175000	Otherwise,
2175000	2177000	let's start from the previous order again.
2177000	2179000	Otherwise, let's go back to RAVE.
2181000	2183000	So your question is
2183000	2185000	what are the more clear
2185000	2187000	policies that have been proposed
2187000	2189000	or what is the situation?
2189000	2191000	Yes.
2191000	2193000	Then I will use
2193000	2195000	the experience of
2195000	2197000	our recent meeting with
2197000	2199000	the senior teacher to explain to you.
2199000	2201000	Because what we did this year
2201000	2203000	was to go to the Legislative Yuan every month
2203000	2205000	to have a meeting.
2205000	2207000	Then the professors of Humanities, Social Sciences and Technology
2207000	2209000	made their own reports.
2209000	2211000	After everyone discussed,
2211000	2213000	the final conclusion was to
2213000	2215000	integrate the opinions of the overall report.
2215000	2217000	In the report at that time,
2217000	2219000	the general direction was
2219000	2221000	that the whole meeting
2221000	2223000	lasted about one hour,
2223000	2225000	almost two hours.
2225000	2227000	The meeting schedule can also be
2227000	2229000	divided into several parts.
2229000	2231000	In fact,
2231000	2233000	we have just discussed
2233000	2235000	several parts.
2235000	2237000	For example,
2237000	2239000	I mentioned that
2239000	2241000	last year,
2241000	2243000	the Ministry of Science and Technology
2243000	2245000	held a seminar on the
2245000	2247000	talent improvement of doctors.
2247000	2249000	At that time,
2249000	2251000	there was a professor at
2251000	2253000	the University of Jianqiao
2253000	2255000	who was in charge of the
2255000	2257000	training of researchers
2257000	2259000	from policy execution
2259000	2261000	to human resources.
2261000	2263000	At that time,
2263000	2265000	I also mentioned that
2265000	2267000	perhaps the Ministry of Education
2267000	2269000	should provide more resources
2269000	2271000	to establish a role
2271000	2273000	like a research center
2273000	2275000	if there is no difficulty
2275000	2277000	in the implementation
2277000	2279000	of this plan.
2279000	2281000	He was thinking about
2281000	2283000	the continuity of these policies
2283000	2285000	not only in the field of
2285000	2287000	post-doctoral studies,
2287000	2289000	but also in the development
2289000	2291000	of the entire career of a doctor.
2291000	2293000	On the other hand,
2293000	2295000	doctors should have
2295000	2297000	a basic knowledge system.
2297000	2299000	For example,
2299000	2301000	how did we explain to him
2301000	2303000	that we have transferred
2303000	2305000	the current data
2305000	2307000	to the professors of
2307000	2309000	major universities in Taiwan
2309000	2311000	every year,
2311000	2313000	and there are about
2313000	2315000	1,200 people
2315000	2317000	who are professionals
2317000	2319000	in the field of
2319000	2321000	post-doctoral studies,
2321000	2323000	so you can think
2323000	2325000	about the size of the market.
2325000	2327000	There are about 2,000
2327000	2329000	new job opportunities.
2329000	2331000	Since these 2,000 people
2331000	2333000	are important people
2333000	2335000	in the Ministry of Education,
2335000	2337000	let's say the employees
2337000	2339000	of the Ministry of Education,
2339000	2341000	so the Ministry of Education
2341000	2343000	should have a basic
2343000	2345000	education guarantee
2345000	2347000	for these so-called
2347000	2349000	educational staff,
2349000	2351000	or you should have
2351000	2353000	a basic environment.
2353000	2355000	If you evaluate
2355000	2357000	this number,
2357000	2359000	there should be
2359000	2361000	4,000 or 5,000
2361000	2363000	new doctoral students
2363000	2365000	every year,
2365000	2367000	so you can
2367000	2369000	say that if
2369000	2371000	at least 1,000 people
2371000	2373000	become professors every year,
2373000	2375000	2,000 people are
2375000	2377000	highly educated people,
2377000	2379000	what kind of
2379000	2381000	basic resources
2381000	2383000	should these people
2383000	2385000	be given?
2385000	2387000	For example,
2387000	2389000	there was a proposal
2389000	2391000	that the former
2391000	2393000	Minister of
2393000	2395000	Administration and
2395000	2397000	the Ministry of Education
2397000	2399000	should have a basic
2399000	2401000	education guarantee.
2401000	2403000	If there are
2403000	2405000	industrial development resources,
2405000	2407000	it can be added
2407000	2409000	to make it higher.
2409000	2411000	So when we see
2411000	2413000	this proposal,
2413000	2415000	even the Ministry of Education
2415000	2417000	has already
2417000	2419000	prepared to
2419000	2421000	approve it.
2421000	2423000	We think it is
2423000	2425000	a good idea.
2425000	2427000	However,
2427000	2429000	the proposal was
2429000	2431000	stopped after
2431000	2433000	Yalda left,
2433000	2435000	and it was not
2435000	2437000	carried out.
2437000	2439000	Later,
2439000	2441000	we had a meeting
2441000	2443000	with the Ministry of Education,
2443000	2445000	and they said
2445000	2447000	they were afraid that
2447000	2449000	if more resources were
2449000	2451000	invested,
2451000	2453000	the proposal would be
2453000	2455000	rejected.
2455000	2457000	Of course,
2457000	2459000	we have some
2459000	2461000	opinions,
2461000	2463000	and there are many
2463000	2465000	other opinions.
2465000	2467000	If you are more careful,
2467000	2469000	you can refer to
2469000	2471000	the document.
2471000	2473000	In my opinion,
2473000	2475000	the bigger structure
2475000	2477000	is like this.
2477000	2479000	I also found
2479000	2481000	that when the president
2481000	2483000	wants to do something,
2483000	2485000	the Ministry of Education
2485000	2487000	will send out the proposal
2487000	2489000	and write a version.
2489000	2491000	For example,
2491000	2493000	there is a 5 plus 2
2493000	2495000	key industry policy
2495000	2497000	in our country's
2497000	2499000	industrial talent policy,
2499000	2501000	and it is to investigate
2501000	2503000	which talents are missing
2503000	2505000	in the key industry.
2505000	2507000	We found that
2507000	2509000	the Ministry of Education
2509000	2511000	did not even investigate
2511000	2513000	how many PhDs are
2513000	2515000	in the industry development
2515000	2517000	or transformation,
2517000	2519000	let alone the policy
2519000	2521000	and implementation.
2521000	2523000	We think it is ridiculous.
2523000	2525000	After our meeting with
2525000	2527000	the Ministry of Education,
2527000	2529000	they said that
2529000	2531000	it is just a form,
2531000	2533000	and they did not
2533000	2535000	investigate this.
2535000	2537000	As mentioned earlier,
2537000	2539000	the integration of all ministries
2539000	2541000	is really difficult.
2541000	2543000	It requires specific
2543000	2545000	inspections and changes.
2545000	2547000	Otherwise,
2547000	2549000	there may be other channels.
2553000	2555000	Do you have anything
2555000	2557000	to add?
2557000	2559000	Or do you want to comment?
2559000	2561000	Let me talk about it.
2561000	2563000	I am Zashi.
2563000	2565000	I mentioned a lot of
2565000	2567000	specific policies
2567000	2569000	that we mentioned to the mayor.
2569000	2571000	From my point of view,
2571000	2573000	in recent years,
2573000	2575000	everyone knows that
2575000	2577000	Taiwan's government,
2577000	2579000	whether it is the Ministry of Technology
2579000	2581000	or the Ministry of Education,
2581000	2583000	has mentioned some
2583000	2585000	international talent planning
2585000	2587000	projects,
2587000	2589000	such as Yushan Scholar,
2589000	2591000	Qianlima,
2591000	2593000	and so on.
2593000	2595000	However,
2595000	2597000	in recent years,
2597000	2599000	the Ministry of Education
2599000	2601000	has proposed
2601000	2603000	these projects
2603000	2605000	to the schools
2605000	2607000	every year,
2607000	2609000	and the money
2609000	2611000	will be allocated
2611000	2613000	to each school.
2613000	2615000	However,
2615000	2617000	we started to
2617000	2619000	focus on international talent
2619000	2621000	because we need
2621000	2623000	a good professor
2623000	2625000	and a good teacher.
2625000	2627000	If these teachers
2627000	2629000	don't have good students,
2629000	2631000	will the teacher
2631000	2633000	really have a strong
2633000	2635000	research motivation?
2635000	2637000	This is what we see.
2637000	2639000	These talent planning projects
2639000	2641000	have already started,
2641000	2643000	but how do you return
2643000	2645000	these important talents
2645000	2647000	to Taiwan?
2647000	2649000	During the meeting with the
2649000	2651000	Minister of Education,
2651000	2653000	we specifically mentioned
2653000	2655000	that in recent years,
2655000	2657000	these talent planning projects
2657000	2659000	are aimed at
2659000	2661000	increasing the salary of professors
2661000	2663000	and teachers,
2663000	2665000	but is it possible
2665000	2667000	to create another project
2667000	2669000	that is more friendly
2669000	2671000	to students?
2671000	2673000	Our view is simple.
2673000	2675000	If you have good teachers
2675000	2677000	and good students,
2677000	2679000	it's meaningless
2679000	2681000	if you don't have good professors.
2681000	2683000	The Ministry of Education
2683000	2685000	is concerned about
2685000	2687000	whether these projects
2687000	2689000	will attract
2689000	2691000	a large number of
2691000	2693000	professors in the future.
2693000	2695000	However,
2695000	2697000	these projects
2697000	2699000	are aimed at
2699000	2701000	excellent professors.
2701000	2703000	We fully agree with this.
2703000	2705000	In my opinion,
2705000	2707000	some things
2707000	2709000	need to be adjusted
2709000	2711000	from a small place.
2711000	2713000	For example,
2713000	2715000	we have been talking about
2715000	2717000	the Doctor's Scholarship Program,
2717000	2719000	the Ministry of Science and Technology's
2719000	2721000	Doctor's Scholarship Program.
2721000	2723000	I talked directly with the
2723000	2725000	Director of the Ministry of Science
2725000	2727000	and Technology.
2727000	2729000	I told him
2729000	2731000	my thoughts on
2731000	2733000	this project.
2733000	2735000	When we interview,
2735000	2737000	we usually
2737000	2739000	talk about the exact salary,
2739000	2741000	such as how much
2741000	2743000	the annual salary is.
2743000	2745000	At least the annual salary is like this.
2745000	2747000	If the company operates better,
2747000	2749000	I will add a few more months.
2749000	2751000	This is a means that a company
2751000	2753000	will definitely use
2753000	2755000	when it is lazy.
2755000	2757000	But in Taiwan,
2757000	2759000	for example,
2759000	2761000	you may have a chance
2761000	2763000	to apply for this scholarship
2763000	2765000	when you come to Taiwan.
2765000	2767000	You may apply for it
2767000	2769000	and you will get
2769000	2771000	NT$40,000 scholarship
2771000	2773000	every month for four years.
2773000	2775000	I started to talk to them.
2775000	2777000	Can't we give
2777000	2779000	the school or push the school
2779000	2781000	to have a more corporate thinking model?
2781000	2783000	Today,
2783000	2785000	Ralph is an excellent doctor.
2785000	2787000	When he came in,
2787000	2789000	I already told him
2789000	2791000	that we think
2791000	2793000	he is an excellent doctor.
2793000	2795000	We hope that
2795000	2797000	you will have a lot of economic support
2797000	2799000	in this stage of your research.
2799000	2801000	One of them is this project.
2801000	2803000	If you choose to study at NTU,
2803000	2805000	I will give you this project.
2805000	2807000	Because we think your conditions are in line.
2807000	2809000	Even for those students
2809000	2811000	who hesitate whether to study at NTU
2811000	2813000	or NTU,
2813000	2815000	can't these schools
2815000	2817000	be more active in
2817000	2819000	applying for scholarships?
2819000	2821000	Do we have to tell them
2821000	2823000	that you may have a chance when you come in?
2823000	2825000	In fact, the Ministry of Science and Technology
2825000	2827000	heard this idea
2827000	2829000	and they also want to move in this direction.
2829000	2831000	Although it seems that
2831000	2833000	it is difficult to say at the university level.
2833000	2835000	In fact, every university
2835000	2837000	may be allocated
2837000	2839000	some positions in each department,
2839000	2841000	but they may not dare
2841000	2843000	to be so brave
2843000	2845000	to apply for scholarships.
2845000	2847000	In fact, I think
2847000	2849000	this is a very important direction
2849000	2851000	to discuss.
2851000	2853000	So, in my own experience,
2853000	2855000	it will be like this.
2855000	2857000	That's all.
2859000	2861000	OK.
2861000	2863000	I am Xiaoyu.
2863000	2865000	What Justin just mentioned
2865000	2867000	is that
2867000	2869000	if NTU teachers
2869000	2871000	are very active
2871000	2873000	in applying for scholarships,
2873000	2875000	NTU teachers
2875000	2877000	can find the best students.
2877000	2879000	But I also know that
2879000	2881000	this is not
2881000	2883000	what NTU professors
2883000	2885000	should do
2885000	2887000	through their personal strength.
2887000	2889000	There should be
2889000	2891000	a more comprehensive
2891000	2893000	at least at the school level.
2893000	2895000	For example, NTU itself
2895000	2897000	should have more specific plans
2897000	2899000	to assist teachers.
2899000	2901000	Instead of giving money to the school
2901000	2903000	and saying,
2903000	2905000	OK, you can do it yourself.
2905000	2907000	You have to provide
2907000	2909000	all kinds of assistance to do it yourself.
2909000	2911000	My point of view
2911000	2913000	on doctoral education
2913000	2915000	is that
2915000	2917000	from our educational point of view,
2917000	2919000	our scholarship
2919000	2921000	is not a bonus, but a benefit.
2921000	2923000	In fact, in doctoral education,
2923000	2925000	to be honest,
2925000	2927000	from the point of view of
2927000	2929000	the government,
2929000	2931000	we actually only look at one thing,
2931000	2933000	that is, we only give it to excellent people.
2933000	2935000	But in fact, doctoral education
2935000	2937000	is not only like this,
2937000	2939000	there is also a free market.
2939000	2941000	If someone is willing to come to
2941000	2943000	the doctoral class and graduate,
2943000	2945000	we will also open it to you.
2945000	2947000	But the related packages
2947000	2949000	may not provide
2949000	2951000	you to pay for yourself,
2951000	2953000	you may have to work harder
2953000	2955000	or cooperate with the professor, etc.
2955000	2957000	In addition,
2961000	2963000	this is my general idea.
2963000	2965000	Let's open it to the audience
2965000	2967000	to see if there are
2967000	2969000	any other questions.
2969000	2971000	Thank you.
2971000	2973000	I have a question.
2973000	2975000	Are there any three people
2975000	2977000	or sorry,
2977000	2979000	two people besides Xiaoyu
2979000	2981000	who want to add to what Xiaoyu just said
2981000	2983000	or what else do you think?
2983000	2985000	At the moment,
2985000	2987000	everyone is very enthusiastic,
2987000	2989000	so we have a lot of questions.
2989000	2991000	Or do you want to
2991000	2993000	discuss the audience's questions?
2993000	2995000	Of course.
2995000	2997000	Sorry,
2997000	2999000	because there are a lot of questions,
2999000	3001000	we probably can't see all of them,
3001000	3003000	and there are really a lot of words,
3003000	3005000	so I may miss it,
3005000	3007000	so I apologize to everyone first.
3007000	3009000	Let's start from the beginning,
3009000	3011000	because maybe some people
3011000	3013000	want to add to what Xiaoyu just said.
3013000	3015000	Xun Yu asked,
3015000	3017000	sorry, let me go back a little bit.
3017000	3019000	The sustainability of policies
3019000	3021000	is terrible.
3021000	3023000	Recently, I heard a rumor that
3023000	3025000	the Columbus Peace Project
3025000	3027000	is about to die.
3027000	3029000	No, I mean it's about to end.
3029000	3031000	I don't know if the government
3031000	3033000	is specifically referring to
3033000	3035000	the Love Song Project,
3035000	3037000	but the sustainability.
3037000	3039000	I don't know what you think.
3039000	3041000	Besides how to look at it,
3041000	3043000	what should we do?
3043000	3045000	OK.
3045000	3047000	Are we answering directly?
3047000	3049000	Yes, yes.
3049000	3051000	OK, let me talk about it.
3051000	3053000	I've been studying this topic recently.
3053000	3055000	In fact, this goes back to
3055000	3057000	the question I asked at the beginning.
3057000	3059000	In fact, let me talk about
3059000	3061000	the so-called Columbus or Einstein Project,
3061000	3063000	which are all called
3063000	3065000	the Young Learners Development Project
3065000	3067000	of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
3067000	3069000	That is, the preliminary basic construction budget
3069000	3071000	may be a four-year
3071000	3073000	continuous plan like this.
3073000	3075000	Because we are now
3075000	3077000	moving towards the third phase,
3077000	3079000	every four years,
3079000	3081000	we are now slowly moving
3081000	3083000	towards the third phase and starting to implement it.
3083000	3085000	In fact, to answer a comprehensive
3085000	3087000	question,
3087000	3089000	the current situation is
3089000	3091000	that the budget should be reduced a little.
3091000	3093000	If I remember correctly,
3093000	3095000	is it 2.3 billion?
3095000	3097000	I need to look it up again,
3097000	3099000	because I have such preliminary information in my hand.
3099000	3101000	The preliminary report of the last issue
3101000	3103000	is about the budget of the Young Learners Development Project
3103000	3105000	and the preliminary plan
3105000	3107000	that is going to be reviewed
3107000	3109000	in this issue.
3109000	3111000	It seems that the budget is a little less,
3111000	3113000	but it is not terminated.
3113000	3115000	Back to the question I'm concerned about,
3115000	3117000	why is this thing
3117000	3119000	very interesting?
3119000	3121000	Because every year when I review the budget,
3121000	3123000	we, as a supervision unit,
3123000	3125000	will write a summary of the budget
3125000	3127000	or freeze it,
3127000	3129000	or the main resolution.
3129000	3131000	These are all the parts that need to be
3131000	3133000	formally replied to you,
3133000	3135000	and they are usually very worried about
3135000	3137000	the budget of the legislators.
3137000	3139000	So usually
3139000	3141000	they will be very concerned about
3141000	3143000	all the things we write.
3143000	3145000	I write one thing every year.
3145000	3147000	I said that the Ministry of Education has a budget plan,
3147000	3149000	the Ministry of Science and Technology has a
3149000	3151000	Young Learners Development Project,
3151000	3153000	and the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
3153000	3155000	a research unit,
3155000	3157000	they also have their own budget plans.
3157000	3159000	And sometimes
3159000	3161000	in the budget of those international talents,
3161000	3163000	the target that everyone is looking for
3163000	3165000	is not too far away.
3165000	3167000	So let's go back to the beginning.
3167000	3169000	Is there any way
3169000	3171000	to have a better integration?
3171000	3173000	In fact, the Ministry of Science and Technology said
3173000	3175000	that I was looking for
3175000	3177000	research experts.
3177000	3179000	The Ministry of Education said
3179000	3181000	that the researchers
3181000	3183000	actually operate
3183000	3185000	like this.
3185000	3187000	That is really a very vague situation.
3187000	3189000	So in fact, I think
3189000	3191000	the plan is not to be broken,
3191000	3193000	but we will pay more attention to
3193000	3195000	the different parts of the plan.
3195000	3197000	In fact, 1 plus 1 must be greater than 2.
3197000	3199000	And in fact, the attitude of the Ministry of Science and Technology
3199000	3201000	every year is that their budget is really not much.
3201000	3203000	We support all their plans.
3203000	3205000	Because I am
3205000	3207000	in charge of the Ministry of Science and Technology
3207000	3209000	and I am in charge of the
3209000	3211000	consultation policy or bill
3211000	3213000	or budget supervision.
3213000	3215000	So I can really
3215000	3217000	say that I fully support
3217000	3219000	many of the plans of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
3219000	3221000	The Ministry of Education really does less.
3221000	3223000	But in some of the plans,
3223000	3225000	I actually think they must cooperate.
3225000	3227000	So every year we will continue to
3227000	3229000	push this department.
3229000	3231000	That's about it.
3231000	3233000	OK.
3233000	3235000	I am Xiaoyu.
3235000	3237000	My question is whether the
3237000	3239000	plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology
3239000	3241000	will continue.
3241000	3243000	As far as I know,
3243000	3245000	just like what
3245000	3247000	Dr. Zha mentioned,
3247000	3249000	the plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology
3249000	3251000	and Einstein is really
3251000	3253000	a special budget.
3253000	3255000	So in other words, it is the
3255000	3257000	budget of the front-end plan.
3257000	3259000	In fact, he said that
3259000	3261000	there is a reduction of
3261000	3263000	more than 2.3 billion.
3263000	3265000	So I think that
3265000	3267000	after the new 520 minister
3267000	3269000	took office,
3269000	3271000	in fact, the plan of
3271000	3273000	the Ministry of Science and Technology
3273000	3275000	or the talent cultivation plan itself,
3275000	3277000	in fact, they will already have a
3277000	3279000	relatively long-term
3279000	3281000	view of this matter.
3281000	3283000	In other words,
3283000	3285000	we are not pushing a short-term
3285000	3287000	plan like the five-year plan,
3287000	3289000	but in the future,
3289000	3291000	I believe it will be announced soon
3291000	3293000	that this matter needs to be
3293000	3295000	promoted for a long time.
3295000	3297000	In other words, our country
3297000	3299000	will have different plans for
3299000	3301000	the cultivation of young scholars,
3301000	3303000	whether they are young scholars,
3303000	3305000	middle-aged scholars,
3305000	3307000	or senior scholars.
3311000	3313000	OK.
3313000	3315000	Ralph, do you want to add something?
3315000	3317000	Or are we looking for another question?
3317000	3319000	It doesn't matter.
3319000	3321000	I just saw an interesting question.
3321000	3323000	I think we should
3323000	3325000	give this question to Ralph.
3325000	3327000	This may be the most
3327000	3329000	in line with your experience.
3329000	3331000	Sorry.
3331000	3333000	He said,
3333000	3335000	what is the relationship
3335000	3337000	between the Association of Researchers
3337000	3339000	and the school?
3339000	3341000	Can you explain the financial
3341000	3343000	situation of the school
3343000	3345000	and the allocation of funds?
3345000	3347000	Then,
3347000	3349000	Jeff,
3349000	3351000	the Association of Researchers
3351000	3353000	in the U.S. can check the
3353000	3355000	financial situation of the school
3355000	3357000	and ask them to provide
3357000	3359000	specific welfare conditions
3359000	3361000	for the students,
3361000	3363000	labor conditions,
3363000	3365000	and living conditions.
3365000	3367000	What is the situation
3367000	3369000	in Taiwan now?
3373000	3375000	I just answered
3375000	3377000	the question.
3377000	3379000	The Association of Researchers
3379000	3381000	mainly plans the use of
3381000	3383000	the annual budget
3383000	3385000	in the Association of
3385000	3387000	Researchers.
3387000	3389000	Unless there are special cases
3389000	3391000	that need to be approved
3391000	3393000	by the school council,
3393000	3395000	most of the discussions and
3395000	3397000	decisions will be made there.
3397000	3399000	At present,
3399000	3401000	there is no student representative
3401000	3403000	in the Association of Researchers.
3403000	3405000	In addition to the Association of
3405000	3407000	Researchers,
3407000	3409000	there is another important
3409000	3411000	participation channel called
3411000	3413000	administrative meetings.
3413000	3415000	Administrative meetings
3415000	3417000	are held by the principal,
3417000	3419000	dean,
3419000	3421000	and director
3421000	3423000	to discuss
3423000	3425000	how to plan
3425000	3427000	the administration
3427000	3429000	of the school.
3429000	3431000	At that time,
3431000	3433000	there will be at least
3433000	3435000	one student representative
3435000	3437000	in the meeting.
3437000	3439000	The current situation is that
3439000	3441000	when the school council
3441000	3443000	feels that this matter
3443000	3445000	is related to the students,
3445000	3447000	they will issue a meeting notice
3447000	3449000	saying that you can come to practice.
3449000	3451000	By practice,
3451000	3453000	it means that you do not
3453000	3455000	have the right to vote,
3455000	3457000	but the school will listen to
3457000	3459000	your opinion.
3459000	3461000	However,
3461000	3463000	this is usually the last straw.
3463000	3465000	When the school feels that
3465000	3467000	this matter is not
3467000	3469000	controversial,
3469000	3471000	they will come to discuss with you.
3471000	3473000	However, as you know,
3473000	3475000	last year and the year before last,
3475000	3477000	there was a lot of discussion
3477000	3479000	about the principal,
3479000	3481000	so some teachers
3481000	3483000	who support the principal
3483000	3485000	or conservative teachers
3485000	3487000	will feel that
3487000	3489000	some student representatives
3489000	3491000	have this tendency,
3491000	3493000	so they failed.
3493000	3495000	I am not depressed about the failure.
3495000	3497000	So,
3497000	3499000	I can listen to
3499000	3501000	everyone's opinion
3501000	3503000	more.
3503000	3505000	Especially today's discussion
3505000	3507000	is very valuable.
3507000	3509000	Someone said that
3509000	3511000	it may be related to
3511000	3513000	the financial structure
3513000	3515000	or the position of the school
3515000	3517000	in general.
3521000	3523000	Ray has mentioned
3523000	3525000	a very interesting thing.
3525000	3527000	I don't know what the other two
3527000	3529000	think.
3529000	3531000	He mentioned that
3531000	3533000	this is related to
3533000	3535000	the role we give them
3535000	3537000	or their own role.
3537000	3539000	What do you think
3539000	3541000	about this?
3545000	3547000	For example,
3547000	3549000	Xiaoyu or Zashi.
3551000	3553000	Are you talking about the role of the university?
3553000	3555000	Yes.
3555000	3557000	How does the university
3557000	3559000	set its own role?
3559000	3561000	Will they decide how to do it?
3565000	3567000	You mean
3567000	3569000	if the school
3569000	3571000	thinks it is
3571000	3573000	a research university
3573000	3575000	or a teaching university
3575000	3577000	or other types of universities,
3577000	3579000	such as industrial universities
3579000	3581000	or entrepreneurial universities?
3581000	3583000	Or something else?
3585000	3587000	Let me add something.
3587000	3589000	I think the financial structure
3589000	3591000	and the right of students
3591000	3593000	are not necessarily related.
3593000	3595000	What is the reason?
3595000	3597000	For example,
3597000	3599000	private colleges in Taiwan
3599000	3601000	have a tuition fee of
3601000	3603000	50% to 70%.
3603000	3605000	But private colleges
3605000	3607000	don't pay much attention to students.
3607000	3609000	That's it.
3611000	3613000	On the one hand,
3613000	3615000	the atmosphere of students' self-participation
3615000	3617000	is not so good.
3617000	3619000	On the other hand,
3619000	3621000	they don't pay much attention
3621000	3623000	to students.
3623000	3625000	So it may be a sufficient condition,
3625000	3627000	but not a necessary condition.
3627000	3629000	If you have time,
3629000	3631000	I see Jeff
3631000	3633000	wants to ask a question.
3633000	3635000	I think it's a good time.
3635000	3637000	So,
3637000	3639000	if it's convenient for Jeff,
3639000	3641000	please turn on the microphone
3641000	3643000	to talk about REEF.
3645000	3647000	Thank you.
3647000	3649000	I'm a third-year student
3649000	3651000	at the University of Indiana
3651000	3653000	in the United States.
3653000	3655000	I used to work
3655000	3657000	as a teacher
3657000	3659000	for several years.
3659000	3661000	I think
3661000	3663000	REEF's
3663000	3665000	information about Taiwan is very good.
3665000	3667000	I think
3667000	3669000	since Taiwan is different
3669000	3671000	from the United States,
3671000	3673000	the United States is a market mechanism.
3673000	3675000	Taiwan is mainly
3675000	3677000	caught by the Ministry of Education.
3677000	3679000	In this case,
3679000	3681000	from the perspective
3681000	3683000	of the Legislative Yuan,
3683000	3685000	I think REEF
3685000	3687000	is an important role
3687000	3689000	in the school
3689000	3691000	role management process.
3691000	3693000	In terms of supervision,
3693000	3695000	can the school
3695000	3697000	implement this mechanism?
3697000	3699000	In addition,
3699000	3701000	in addition to the REEF,
3701000	3703000	REEF will also form a union.
3703000	3705000	The union
3705000	3707000	is different from the
3707000	3709000	REEF.
3709000	3711000	The union actually
3711000	3713000	starts from the perspective
3713000	3715000	of the Legislative Yuan
3715000	3717000	to talk about the lack of
3717000	3719000	wage and salary.
3719000	3721000	What the school
3721000	3723000	will do
3723000	3725000	is to mobilize
3725000	3727000	demonstrations
3727000	3729000	and make demands.
3729000	3731000	As I mentioned
3731000	3733000	in the chat,
3733000	3735000	these demands
3735000	3737000	come from
3737000	3739000	more information.
3739000	3741000	For example,
3741000	3743000	the salary of the school
3743000	3745000	is transparent.
3745000	3747000	I can share with you
3747000	3749000	that REEF
3749000	3751000	did some reports
3751000	3753000	and mentioned
3753000	3755000	the salary of the
3755000	3757000	football team
3757000	3759000	coach
3759000	3761000	is as high as
3761000	3763000	6 to 7 million Taiwan dollars
3763000	3765000	a year.
3765000	3767000	They feel that
3767000	3769000	the school
3769000	3771000	cannot hide
3771000	3773000	this information.
3773000	3775000	Therefore, the school
3775000	3777000	cannot stand still.
3777000	3779000	I think the transparency of this information
3779000	3781000	is very important.
3781000	3783000	Taiwan is not a market mechanism.
3783000	3785000	The Ministry of Education
3785000	3787000	should implement
3787000	3789000	this transparent mechanism
3789000	3791000	through the Ministry of Education.
3791000	3793000	Perhaps this will
3793000	3795000	be helpful
3795000	3797000	to solve the problem.
3797000	3799000	That's all. Thank you.
3825000	3827000	I think this is
3827000	3829000	a process of transformation.
3829000	3831000	In the process of transformation,
3831000	3833000	I think it is very important
3833000	3835000	to ensure the legalization.
3835000	3837000	Of course,
3837000	3839000	in the next session,
3839000	3841000	we will focus on
3841000	3843000	the so-called school dismissal.
3843000	3845000	However,
3845000	3847000	many rights and interests
3847000	3849000	are included in the Ministry of Education
3849000	3851000	in the University Act
3851000	3853000	or the school fund management
3853000	3855000	in the Ministry of Education.
3855000	3857000	These things should be reviewed.
3857000	3859000	Recently,
3859000	3861000	many groups of students
3861000	3863000	have come to
3863000	3865000	communicate with us
3865000	3867000	on the University Act.
3867000	3869000	In terms of
3869000	3871000	these self-government groups,
3871000	3873000	can they have more
3873000	3875000	guaranteed things?
3875000	3877000	For example,
3877000	3879000	we heard that
3879000	3881000	some schools
3881000	3883000	charge two different
3883000	3885000	channels for their
3885000	3887000	school fees.
3887000	3889000	You can't pay online.
3889000	3891000	You have to pay by paper.
3891000	3893000	This is incredible.
3893000	3895000	Or some schools
3895000	3897000	because the students
3897000	3899000	group, for example,
3899000	3901000	the source of the money
3901000	3903000	is the tuition fee.
3903000	3905000	Basically,
3905000	3907000	the student council
3907000	3909000	can decide
3909000	3911000	what to do
3911000	3913000	and how to do it.
3913000	3915000	Even if the money
3915000	3917000	is the tuition fee,
3917000	3919000	the school has to do it.
3919000	3921000	In fact, the student rights
3921000	3923000	are moving forward.
3923000	3925000	However,
3925000	3927000	many schools still
3927000	3929000	have a conservative attitude.
3929000	3931000	What should we do?
3931000	3933000	I agree with what Jeff said.
3933000	3935000	The student rights
3935000	3937000	can't be a hostage.
3937000	3939000	If you are willing to communicate
3939000	3941000	with a good principal,
3941000	3943000	you will have more opportunities.
3943000	3945000	Sometimes it's hard to be a principal.
3945000	3947000	In the school council,
3947000	3949000	he didn't just say it.
3949000	3951000	Many teachers are there.
3951000	3953000	He wants to give students
3953000	3955000	more space,
3955000	3957000	but sometimes it's hard to do it.
3957000	3959000	Legislative establishment
3959000	3961000	is necessary.
3961000	3963000	Through the university law
3963000	3965000	and the school fund,
3965000	3967000	it's two different things.
3967000	3969000	However,
3969000	3971000	the legislative process
3971000	3973000	is still ongoing.
3977000	3979000	Hello, I'm Xiaoyu.
3979000	3981000	Is Jeff studying
3981000	3983000	at Indiana Bloomington?
3983000	3985000	I also graduated
3985000	3987000	from this school.
3987000	3989000	I majored in higher education.
3989000	3991000	As far as I know,
3991000	3993000	the tuition fee
3993000	3995000	for public universities
3995000	3997000	is transparent.
3997000	3999000	It's in the US.
3999000	4001000	In my impression,
4001000	4003000	the IU Foundation
4003000	4005000	is not open
4005000	4007000	to the public.
4007000	4009000	I don't know
4009000	4011000	if there are any adjustments.
4013000	4015000	Some employees
4015000	4017000	are transparent.
4017000	4019000	In my impression,
4019000	4021000	the professors are not transparent.
4021000	4023000	In Taiwan,
4023000	4025000	the HR department
4025000	4027000	often discusses
4027000	4029000	whether the tuition fee
4029000	4031000	is suitable for the public.
4031000	4033000	In other words,
4033000	4035000	will it cause
4035000	4037000	some kind of
4037000	4039000	malicious competition?
4039000	4041000	I think we should
4041000	4043000	be careful
4043000	4045000	and consider
4045000	4047000	whether the tuition fee
4047000	4049000	is suitable for the public.
4049000	4051000	In the future,
4051000	4053000	will there be
4053000	4055000	a union
4055000	4057000	or some rights protection?
4057000	4059000	I think we can
4059000	4061000	work on it.
4061000	4063000	Through the union,
4063000	4065000	the tuition fee
4065000	4067000	can be improved.
4067000	4069000	I think it's
4069000	4071000	a positive step.
4071000	4073000	That's all.
4079000	4081000	I don't understand
4081000	4083000	one thing.
4083000	4085000	It's my personal question.
4085000	4087000	Why Taiwan
4087000	4089000	or other countries
4089000	4091000	like Japan
4091000	4093000	have such
4093000	4095000	poor
4095000	4097000	marketing
4097000	4099000	system?
4099000	4101000	What's the reason?
4101000	4103000	Why do we
4103000	4105000	become different
4105000	4107000	from the US?
4107000	4109000	In the US,
4109000	4111000	for the sake of talents
4111000	4113000	and PhD students,
4113000	4115000	they hire people
4115000	4117000	with their salary.
4117000	4119000	But in Taiwan,
4119000	4121000	the power of the labor market
4121000	4123000	is the opposite.
4123000	4125000	In other words,
4125000	4127000	we need to ask
4127000	4129000	the school to pay us tuition.
4129000	4131000	If we don't pay
4131000	4133000	the tuition fee,
4133000	4135000	no one will
4135000	4137000	pay the tuition fee.
4137000	4139000	That's my question.
4139000	4141000	Why is Taiwan
4141000	4143000	such a poor market?
4143000	4145000	What's the reason?
4147000	4149000	Does anyone
4149000	4151000	want to
4151000	4153000	answer this question?
4153000	4155000	It looks like
4155000	4157000	Yu wants to answer.
4157000	4159000	Let me answer
4159000	4161000	briefly.
4161000	4163000	When we had a meeting
4163000	4165000	last year,
4165000	4167000	Yu asked
4167000	4169000	this question.
4169000	4171000	Why is Taiwan
4171000	4173000	not legalized?
4173000	4175000	What's the current situation?
4175000	4177000	Yu's answer
4177000	4179000	was
4179000	4181000	there are
4181000	4183000	several doubts.
4183000	4185000	First,
4185000	4187000	all the departments that don't make money
4187000	4189000	may be shut down.
4189000	4191000	Because universities
4191000	4193000	are the only indicators.
4193000	4195000	Second,
4195000	4197000	the whole society
4197000	4199000	is divided.
4199000	4201000	What is our
4201000	4203000	view of education?
4205000	4207000	I may need to look up
4207000	4209000	the meeting notes.
4209000	4211000	There may be other answers.
4211000	4213000	However,
4213000	4215000	people generally
4215000	4217000	look at it
4217000	4219000	as a negative effect
4219000	4221000	on the society.
4221000	4223000	What's the difference
4223000	4225000	between legalization
4225000	4227000	and marketization?
4227000	4229000	That's all.
4233000	4235000	I'm Yu.
4235000	4237000	I have a question
4237000	4239000	about whether
4239000	4241000	higher education
4241000	4243000	is a capital market.
4243000	4245000	Is it necessarily good?
4245000	4247000	It involves many things,
4247000	4249000	such as regulation
4249000	4251000	and so on.
4251000	4253000	In my opinion,
4253000	4255000	universities should not
4255000	4257000	rely on the Ministry of Education.
4257000	4259000	Almost all universities
4259000	4261000	rely on the Ministry of Education.
4261000	4263000	However,
4263000	4265000	the Ministry of Education
4265000	4267000	spends
4267000	4269000	less than half
4269000	4271000	of their budget.
4271000	4273000	As for
4273000	4275000	legalization,
4275000	4277000	such as Japan
4277000	4279000	or other countries,
4279000	4281000	it may lead to
4281000	4283000	the collapse of
4283000	4285000	non-profit science.
4285000	4287000	To be honest,
4287000	4289000	non-profit science
4289000	4291000	is still
4291000	4293000	maintained in the United States.
4293000	4295000	For example,
4295000	4297000	it is still maintained
4297000	4299000	in the top universities
4299000	4301000	in the field of
4301000	4303000	human and social science.
4303000	4305000	In my country,
4305000	4307000	the National University
4307000	4309000	is a national university.
4309000	4311000	It is responsible
4311000	4313000	for maintaining
4313000	4315000	non-profit science
4315000	4317000	in the field of
4317000	4319000	human and social science.
4319000	4321000	I think
4321000	4323000	there should be
4323000	4325000	more communication
4325000	4327000	between universities.
4327000	4329000	It is not just
4329000	4331000	trying to
4331000	4333000	promote non-profit science.
4333000	4335000	We should listen to
4335000	4337000	everyone's opinions.
4337000	4339000	That's all.
4341000	4343000	What about Zha Shi?
4343000	4345000	Do you have any opinion?
4345000	4347000	It's okay.
4347000	4349000	Ralph has already said that.
4349000	4351000	Okay.
4351000	4353000	It has been more than
4353000	4355000	an hour.
4355000	4357000	It will be an hour and a half
4357000	4359000	in 10 minutes.
4359000	4361000	That's what we didn't mention.
4361000	4363000	If you are curious or
4363000	4365000	want to know more,
4365000	4367000	you can ask our speaker.
4369000	4371000	Or did I miss something?
4373000	4375000	Okay.
4375000	4377000	Sorry.
4377000	4379000	Go ahead.
4379000	4381000	I just want to share
4381000	4383000	our high-profile
4383000	4385000	video and meeting
4385000	4387000	with you.
4387000	4389000	Okay.
4391000	4393000	Sorry.
4393000	4395000	I have a question.
4395000	4397000	Do you know
4397000	4399000	how many high-profile researchers
4399000	4401000	are needed in Taiwan?
4401000	4403000	Are there too many
4403000	4405000	high-profile researchers?
4405000	4407000	Can we
4407000	4409000	focus on some of them?
4409000	4411000	It's a classic question.
4411000	4413000	Can we ask
4413000	4415000	this way?
4415000	4417000	How many high-profile researchers
4417000	4419000	are needed?
4419000	4421000	How many schools?
4421000	4423000	How many teachers?
4423000	4425000	How many students?
4425000	4427000	It's a classic question.
4427000	4429000	How many schools?
4429000	4431000	How many teachers?
4431000	4433000	How many students?
4433000	4435000	Do you have any opinion?
4435000	4437000	Do I have to say?
4439000	4441000	It's the biggest
4441000	4443000	problem we have.
4443000	4445000	Obviously,
4445000	4447000	there must be a big employment problem.
4447000	4449000	Let me give you an example.
4449000	4451000	When we had a meeting,
4451000	4453000	there was a simple calculation.
4453000	4455000	There are so many
4455000	4457000	high-profile researchers you can hire
4457000	4459000	in a year.
4459000	4461000	There is no shortage of
4461000	4463000	people in the industry.
4463000	4465000	Every year,
4465000	4467000	there are at least
4467000	4469000	10 jobs
4469000	4471000	in the industry.
4471000	4473000	There is a big gap.
4473000	4475000	So, we asked the Ministry of Education
4475000	4477000	about the plan
4477000	4479000	of the whole
4479000	4481000	graduate school
4481000	4483000	or the whole
4483000	4485000	human resources evaluation.
4485000	4487000	To be honest,
4487000	4489000	the result we asked
4489000	4491000	was that
4491000	4493000	they didn't do well
4493000	4495000	in the special graduate school.
4495000	4497000	For example,
4497000	4499000	I said that
4499000	4501000	the Ministry of Education
4501000	4503000	did not investigate
4503000	4505000	the high-profile talents
4505000	4507000	for the development of 5 plus 2.
4507000	4509000	So,
4509000	4511000	if you want to say
4511000	4513000	if it's too deep now,
4513000	4515000	it must be too deep.
4515000	4517000	But what is a reasonable number?
4517000	4519000	Especially now,
4519000	4521000	it's a decimal trend.
4521000	4523000	When the industry transforms,
4523000	4525000	is there any organization
4525000	4527000	or a policy-making unit
4527000	4529000	that can provide
4529000	4531000	the answer?
4531000	4533000	In my experience,
4533000	4535000	I don't think
4535000	4537000	there is one.
4539000	4541000	Hello,
4541000	4543000	I'm Xiaoyu.
4543000	4545000	I think
4545000	4547000	to find the problem
4547000	4549000	or to find
4549000	4551000	the future trend,
4551000	4553000	I think
4553000	4555000	we can do it.
4555000	4557000	But what I'm confused about
4557000	4559000	is that we can't find the solution.
4559000	4561000	That's what I'm confused about.
4561000	4563000	Of course,
4563000	4565000	I think the industry needs
4565000	4567000	our supply and demand
4567000	4569000	must be
4569000	4571000	accurate.
4571000	4573000	That's what I'm confused about.
4573000	4575000	But now,
4575000	4577000	whether it's a PhD
4577000	4579000	or a future talent
4579000	4581000	evaluation,
4581000	4583000	I think
4583000	4585000	it's very difficult.
4585000	4587000	The industry
4587000	4589000	may not know
4589000	4591000	the relevant information.
4591000	4593000	But they may not know
4593000	4595000	the future development
4595000	4597000	of their company
4597000	4599000	or how many people
4599000	4601000	they need
4601000	4603000	in the next few years.
4603000	4605000	Even if you ask TSMC,
4605000	4607000	they may not know.
4607000	4609000	That's what I'm confused about.
4609000	4611000	How many students
4611000	4613000	do we need?
4613000	4615000	I agree that
4615000	4617000	with the number of students
4617000	4619000	and enrollment,
4619000	4621000	let's say
4621000	4623000	4,000 to 5,000 people a year,
4623000	4625000	the demand in the academic world
4625000	4627000	may be around 1,000 a year.
4627000	4629000	There is a big gap
4629000	4631000	between supply and demand.
4631000	4633000	But the problem is
4633000	4635000	that I think
4635000	4637000	PhD education
4637000	4639000	is half of
4639000	4641000	what we need
4641000	4643000	to find
4643000	4645000	excellent academic talents.
4645000	4647000	I think half of it
4647000	4649000	is the market mechanism.
4649000	4651000	Half of it is the economic planning,
4651000	4653000	half of it is the market mechanism.
4653000	4655000	In other words,
4655000	4657000	if a lot of people
4657000	4659000	are willing to take a PhD,
4659000	4661000	it's OK for us.
4661000	4663000	But you may be burdened
4663000	4665000	and take it as
4665000	4667000	a part of the economic planning.
4667000	4669000	For us,
4669000	4671000	it's more important
4671000	4673000	how to attract excellent people
4673000	4675000	to take a PhD.
4675000	4677000	This is what we may
4677000	4679000	focus on in the future,
4679000	4681000	whether it's research or industry.
4681000	4683000	As for the school,
4683000	4685000	as I mentioned at the end,
4685000	4687000	how many universities
4687000	4689000	or teachers
4689000	4691000	or students
4691000	4693000	or staff
4693000	4695000	are there?
4695000	4697000	Some of you may know
4697000	4699000	that if you calculate it,
4699000	4701000	you will know that
4701000	4703000	in the next 10 to 15 years,
4703000	4705000	I guess
4705000	4707000	there are only
4707000	4709000	national universities
4709000	4711000	and medical universities
4711000	4713000	with competitive
4713000	4715000	medical departments
4715000	4717000	in the future.
4717000	4719000	To be honest,
4719000	4721000	other schools will not be able to
4721000	4723000	take a PhD or transfer.
4723000	4725000	This is my personal opinion.
4725000	4727000	I guess
4727000	4729000	that
4729000	4731000	in the future,
4731000	4733000	the number of teachers
4733000	4735000	may be
4735000	4737000	around 40,000
4737000	4739000	or 50,000.
4739000	4741000	At that time,
4741000	4743000	there may be
4743000	4745000	only about 20,000 teachers
4745000	4747000	in the country.
4747000	4749000	This is our current estimate.
4749000	4751000	If you are interested,
4751000	4753000	you can keep calculating
4753000	4755000	and see if it's what we think.
4755000	4757000	Our idea is
4757000	4759000	to increase the number
4759000	4761000	of students
4761000	4763000	in national universities.
4763000	4765000	This so-called increase
4765000	4767000	is a situation
4767000	4769000	where the total number
4769000	4771000	is under control
4771000	4773000	and the number
4773000	4775000	of students
4775000	4777000	is constantly increasing.
4777000	4779000	The question is
4779000	4781000	about schools, students and teachers.
4781000	4783000	In fact,
4783000	4785000	we say that this meeting
4785000	4787000	must be held
4787000	4787000	
4787000	4789000	school withdrawal regulations.
4789000	4791000	Otherwise,
4791000	4793000	from the perspective
4793000	4795000	of the Ministry of Education,
4795000	4797000	the Ministry of Education
4797000	4799000	has a budget
4799000	4801000	of more than 26 million yuan every year.
4801000	4803000	37% of the budget
4803000	4805000	is spent on higher education,
4805000	4807000	which is about 100 billion yuan.
4807000	4809000	The current direction
4809000	4811000	of the Ministry of Education
4811000	4813000	is to cut
4813000	4815000	some of the basic expenses
4815000	4817000	and apply for
4817000	4819000	a higher education upgrade plan
4819000	4821000	for the school.
4821000	4823000	Of course,
4823000	4825000	although private universities
4825000	4827000	are not public,
4827000	4829000	they still have some subsidies.
4829000	4831000	So all schools
4831000	4833000	say that the scholarship is not enough
4833000	4835000	to apply for a higher education upgrade plan.
4835000	4837000	In fact, this is just
4837000	4839000	a basic default.
4839000	4841000	I can't make some breakthrough plans.
4841000	4843000	These things are actually
4843000	4845000	so many from the entire Ministry of Education.
4845000	4847000	But maybe we are going the wrong way in Taiwan.
4847000	4849000	That is, from Guangzhou University
4849000	4851000	to today,
4851000	4853000	we have to close
4853000	4855000	these universities one by one.
4855000	4857000	In fact, we all know
4857000	4859000	how difficult this is in practice.
4859000	4861000	Why didn't the school withdrawal regulations
4861000	4863000	in Taiwan
4863000	4865000	take too much power?
4865000	4867000	If you want to close my private school,
4867000	4869000	how many people
4869000	4871000	will be affected?
4871000	4873000	How much is the interest structure?
4873000	4875000	So everyone stepped on it and didn't do it.
4875000	4877000	This is a very real
4877000	4879000	situation.
4879000	4881000	Now we are focusing on the industry
4881000	4883000	and pushing it to each school.
4883000	4885000	Now it's all like Xiaoyu said,
4885000	4887000	extra fees.
4887000	4889000	In fact, this is also a statistic.
4889000	4891000	Now the total enrollment
4891000	4893000	of universities in Taiwan
4893000	4895000	may be 250,000
4895000	4897000	or 260,000.
4897000	4899000	But the number of students we actually recruit
4899000	4901000	seems to be only 160,000.
4901000	4903000	What about the key industry now?
4903000	4905000	It's extra fees.
4905000	4907000	You will think,
4907000	4909000	how can there be such a gap in numbers?
4909000	4911000	But now as long as it's a key industry,
4911000	4913000	telecommunications, 5 plus 2,
4913000	4915000	the national defense industry,
4915000	4917000	I'll give you an extra fee for your school.
4917000	4919000	This is a strategy.
4919000	4921000	But why do this?
4921000	4923000	In the end, it's still a cruel thing.
4923000	4925000	You're going to cut the enrollment
4925000	4927000	of schools today.
4927000	4929000	What you touch is the teacher's
4929000	4931000	current teaching.
4931000	4933000	We can all understand
4933000	4935000	what the actual problem may be.
4935000	4937000	So when I think about
4937000	4939000	this question,
4939000	4941000	maybe I'm a minister.
4941000	4943000	I often
4943000	4945000	communicate with many people
4945000	4947000	about their own
4947000	4949000	fundamentalism.
4949000	4951000	And many times it's really
4951000	4953000	a huge thing.
4953000	4955000	It's really not that easy.
4955000	4957000	Maybe you have to start from a young age.
4957000	4959000	Do you think the Ministry of Education
4959000	4961000	is actually calculating
4961000	4963000	how many schools are left in the future?
4963000	4965000	I believe they won't do it.
4965000	4967000	But now,
4967000	4969000	just like the current version of the Ministry of Education
4969000	4971000	that is to say,
4971000	4973000	I encourage you,
4973000	4975000	I give you a way,
4975000	4977000	you can go.
4977000	4979000	But the Ministry of Education's attitude is
4979000	4981000	that in addition to this,
4981000	4983000	it has no way to follow more actively.
4983000	4985000	It has already planned
4985000	4987000	the number of schools that may be left in the future.
4987000	4989000	The rest of these are
4989000	4991000	going to be challenged in the future.
4991000	4993000	It early deployed
4993000	4995000	to tell these schools
4995000	4997000	that you should retire first.
4997000	4999000	In fact, this is really a very,
4999000	5001000	very difficult thing.
5001000	5003000	Many people give their opinions.
5003000	5005000	But from the perspective of the Ministry of Education,
5005000	5007000	it has a lot of pressure
5007000	5009000	from schools,
5009000	5011000	even a lot of teachers.
5011000	5013000	I think this is a big problem.
5013000	5015000	But indeed,
5015000	5017000	from the total number of recruits
5017000	5019000	to the actual number of recruits,
5019000	5021000	in fact, just having such a big gap,
5021000	5023000	we know that we definitely need
5023000	5025000	more clues.
5025000	5027000	I think there are many more
5027000	5029000	things to discuss.
5031000	5033000	We seem to have a question.
5033000	5035000	I think this question
5035000	5037000	is very suitable for an interlude.
5037000	5039000	This question comes from
5039000	5041000	Liao Kunyan.
5041000	5043000	His question is this.
5043000	5045000	In Taiwan,
5045000	5047000	among all kinds of problems,
5047000	5049000	does the public really care about
5049000	5051000	the education issue?
5051000	5053000	This is a very cruel question.
5053000	5055000	His answer is,
5055000	5057000	do you have any specific ideas
5057000	5059000	to help the public
5059000	5061000	solve this problem?
5061000	5063000	Let's take this question
5063000	5065000	to sum up today's event.
5065000	5067000	Let's go back to the order
5067000	5069000	from the beginning.
5069000	5071000	Let's start with Xiaoyu.
5073000	5075000	I am Xiaoyu.
5075000	5077000	I am a high-level educator.
5077000	5079000	But I often joke that
5079000	5081000	high-level education
5081000	5083000	is not professional.
5083000	5085000	The so-called lack of professionalism
5085000	5087000	is that we do not pay much attention
5087000	5089000	to the public's opinion.
5089000	5091000	As long as it is the public,
5091000	5093000	as long as it is someone who
5093000	5095000	used to go to college,
5095000	5097000	or as long as it is a college teacher
5097000	5099000	in the school,
5099000	5101000	everyone thinks they know
5101000	5103000	high-level education very well.
5103000	5105000	But in fact,
5105000	5107000	high-level education
5107000	5109000	is a very complicated
5109000	5111000	and a situation
5111000	5113000	that requires a lot of
5113000	5115000	details to be discussed.
5115000	5117000	In fact,
5117000	5119000	high-level education
5119000	5121000	is mainly based on
5121000	5123000	research universities.
5123000	5125000	In other words,
5125000	5127000	I can even say that
5127000	5129000	it is mainly based on
5129000	5131000	professors from the University of Taiwan.
5131000	5133000	But in fact,
5133000	5135000	professors from the University of Taiwan
5135000	5137000	have a disadvantage
5137000	5139000	that they cannot see
5139000	5141000	the situation of other types
5141000	5143000	of schools,
5143000	5145000	but the problem is that
5145000	5147000	we are really facing
5147000	5149000	a problem.
5149000	5151000	In fact, we cannot come up
5151000	5153000	with a solution
5153000	5155000	to solve the problem
5155000	5157000	to help the high-level education
5157000	5159000	industry or
5159000	5161000	other schools
5161000	5163000	to have a better development.
5163000	5165000	In this case,
5165000	5167000	it is difficult for me to say
5167000	5169000	whether the public is
5169000	5171000	concerned about high-level education
5171000	5173000	or not.
5173000	5175000	But in fact,
5175000	5177000	we should also help
5177000	5179000	other schools or institutions
5179000	5181000	to propose specific solutions
5181000	5183000	to the current situation
5183000	5185000	of high-level education.
5185000	5187000	Thank you.
5189000	5191000	Thank you.
5191000	5193000	Let's move on to Justin.
5193000	5195000	OK.
5195000	5197000	In fact,
5197000	5199000	I think that
5199000	5201000	high-level education
5201000	5203000	today is more focused on
5203000	5205000	post-doctoral or post-doctoral education.
5205000	5207000	In fact, this is a stage
5207000	5209000	of the pyramid.
5209000	5211000	Legislators want votes.
5211000	5213000	Which ethnic group has the most votes?
5213000	5215000	It is the state.
5215000	5217000	It is the state.
5217000	5219000	Because all people go through state education.
5219000	5221000	Most people go to college,
5221000	5223000	but today we are concerned
5223000	5225000	about the rights of doctoral students.
5225000	5227000	When we talk about this matter,
5227000	5229000	it is obvious that
5229000	5231000	it is so small.
5231000	5233000	But is it important?
5233000	5235000	Does it have anything to do
5235000	5237000	with national security and national competitiveness?
5237000	5239000	Absolutely.
5239000	5241000	I think
5241000	5243000	from this perspective,
5243000	5245000	we probably know
5245000	5247000	that legislators
5247000	5249000	who are really concerned
5249000	5251000	about this issue,
5251000	5253000	and even peers of the Ministry of Education,
5253000	5255000	when they are concerned about high-level education,
5255000	5257000	they will spend more time
5257000	5259000	and energy.
5259000	5261000	After all,
5261000	5263000	fewer and fewer students
5263000	5265000	and fewer and fewer people
5265000	5267000	are concerned about it.
5267000	5269000	In fact,
5269000	5271000	I think
5271000	5273000	it is important
5273000	5275000	to start from
5275000	5277000	what we are concerned about.
5277000	5279000	We must have our own reasons
5279000	5281000	and things we believe in,
5281000	5283000	so we come out to pay attention.
5283000	5285000	We call on more people
5285000	5287000	who are concerned about this issue.
5287000	5289000	In fact,
5289000	5291000	when I first heard about
5291000	5293000	what REEF was going to do in the future,
5293000	5295000	it was very, very important.
5295000	5297000	How can we get
5297000	5299000	more people
5299000	5301000	who are concerned about this issue
5301000	5303000	to pay more attention
5303000	5305000	and communicate more?
5305000	5307000	And through an organization,
5307000	5309000	the actual energy
5309000	5311000	you can generate is very strong.
5311000	5313000	I think it is very important
5313000	5315000	to cooperate with these
5315000	5317000	external units.
5317000	5319000	Because in the end,
5319000	5321000	as REEF said at the beginning,
5321000	5323000	from an official,
5323000	5325000	even from the president
5325000	5327000	of the Executive Yuan,
5327000	5329000	whether he supports it
5329000	5331000	or not,
5331000	5333000	it is up to the leaders
5333000	5335000	of these ministries
5335000	5337000	and legislators
5337000	5339000	to pay attention.
5339000	5341000	There is no way to call
5341000	5343000	a person who is already working
5343000	5345000	and not studying for a doctor
5345000	5347000	to pay attention to this issue right away.
5347000	5349000	But this is actually very distant.
5349000	5351000	So I think it is very pragmatic
5351000	5353000	to bring people who are willing to pay attention
5353000	5355000	together through more activities
5355000	5357000	as much as possible,
5357000	5359000	so that we can do something together.
5359000	5361000	That's all.
5361000	5363000	Okay, then it's REEF's turn.
5365000	5367000	If you think about it
5367000	5369000	in a pragmatic way,
5369000	5371000	after we held the meeting
5371000	5373000	of REEF,
5373000	5375000	we thought that
5375000	5377000	instead of doing more research
5377000	5379000	and policy development
5379000	5381000	for the Ministry of Education,
5381000	5383000	we should think about
5383000	5385000	how to continue
5385000	5387000	a long-term power
5387000	5389000	that can continue to happen
5389000	5391000	with so many problems.
5391000	5393000	Assuming that
5393000	5395000	there is no sudden
5395000	5397000	interest in
5397000	5399000	high-ranking or doctors,
5399000	5401000	because of the issue of
5401000	5403000	the ballot,
5403000	5405000	and assuming that
5405000	5407000	there is no sudden interest
5407000	5409000	in government officials,
5409000	5411000	I think
5411000	5413000	there are two possible
5413000	5415000	possible options.
5415000	5417000	There are three possible directions.
5417000	5419000	One is that
5419000	5421000	government officials have a certain chance
5421000	5423000	to pay attention,
5423000	5425000	and maybe they can
5425000	5427000	have some formal
5427000	5429000	legal institutions
5429000	5431000	to do the research
5431000	5433000	on the policy.
5433000	5435000	The second is that
5435000	5437000	universities should have
5437000	5439000	more resources
5439000	5441000	or be more serious
5441000	5443000	in this area.
5443000	5445000	There will be a more
5445000	5447000	stable power in it.
5447000	5449000	The third is what I'm thinking
5449000	5451000	and what I want to do.
5451000	5453000	When I asked the
5453000	5455000	High-Level Education Association,
5455000	5457000	they were
5457000	5459000	proposing some
5459000	5461000	reform proposals.
5461000	5463000	However, the youth
5463000	5465000	association under them
5465000	5467000	has no manpower
5467000	5469000	because everyone
5469000	5471000	has to go to work after graduation.
5471000	5473000	Although the situation
5473000	5475000	is difficult,
5475000	5477000	there are some organizations
5477000	5479000	and organizations
5479000	5481000	around me
5481000	5483000	who are willing
5483000	5485000	to pay attention.
5485000	5487000	I hope to
5487000	5489000	form some consensus
5489000	5491000	to form an organization.
5491000	5493000	Instead of
5493000	5495000	proposing a proposal
5495000	5497000	or a policy study,
5497000	5499000	it is more feasible
5499000	5501000	to gather everyone's
5501000	5503000	opinions and
5503000	5505000	deepen
5505000	5507000	or discuss
5507000	5509000	and form an organization.
5509000	5511000	That's it.
5537000	5539000	Thank you for watching!
