1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello everyone, I am the host of today's presentation. My name is Lu Haoran. I am currently studying for my doctorate degree at the University of Connecticut in the United States.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I am also a staff member of Project Terra.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Project Terra provides online presentations to young Taiwanese scholars from all over the world.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today's speaker is Mark Du Youlin.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I would like to start by reminding Mark that what we are about to see is not his video.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Therefore, I would like to ask him to share his screen.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mark's past experience is in social science and education. His major is artificial intelligence, which includes personality, creativity, and consumer behavior.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
After his research on cognitive science, his current research is related to natural language.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He is now a research assistant at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Connecticut.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He also has a personal website.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You are welcome to visit Project Terra's website for more information.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Today's topic is Applied NLP to Understand Creativity.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Take Twitter and Kickstarter for example.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It focuses on the knowledge of reverse engineering and applied psychology.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I believe everyone is very interested in today's presentation.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you for attending today's presentation.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before Mark's presentation, I would like to ask everyone to leave a comment in the chat area.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I will pass this question to Mark.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please reply.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now I will give the floor to Mark.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello, everyone.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you for attending today's online presentation.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Today's topic is about public knowledge.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
My name is Du Youlin.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My English name is Mark.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will jump to my self-introduction page first.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
My name is Mark.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
At first, I studied social science at the University of Connecticut.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then I transferred to the adult education department at the University of Connecticut.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then I stayed at the University of Connecticut.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was a research assistant at CS.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now I am a research assistant at the Center for Neuroscience Research at the University of Connecticut.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
When I was in college, there was a professor who specializes in human resources management.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He was interested in creativity.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I learned from him.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When I graduated from college, I worked on an AI project.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So I am also quite interested in computer science.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will combine these two topics today.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you are interested in psychology, computer science, computer science, or data science,

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you are welcome to communicate with me.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Data science has three parts.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If you have seen the literature diagram,

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The top left corner is computer science.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The top right corner is data science.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The bottom is domain knowledge.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It depends on which major you are majoring in.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This field is really fascinating.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will share it now.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There are four parts to my outline today.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The second part is self-introduction.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The second part is about public knowledge.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In general, people think that creativity is good.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In theory, the public knowledge website is very popular.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you are very creative, I will share my research results.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The third part is about behavioral economics.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's called reversal bias.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In a certain situation, we will choose A.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
In a certain situation, we will choose B.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why do we have such a reversal bias?

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will explain more later.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The last part is the conclusion.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's review today's topic.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Creative Fundraising.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How to write a creative fundraising?

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How to raise the most money?

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The tool I use is the latent language analysis in natural language processing.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I use KS as an example.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let me briefly explain the definition of creativity.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There are two definitions of creativity.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The first one is the most familiar to us.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's novelty.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's the level of imagination.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The second one is more interesting.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The second one is useful.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not just imagination.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Your imagination can be used.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's the so-called creativity.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There is a theory that creativity is economic theory.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you can achieve great success in the economy,

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
we will think you are a useful ability.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's all for today.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sorry.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
At the beginning of the first day,

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I want to invite you to do a small activity.

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This activity is a question.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The three pictures on the screen are the three products on Kickstarter.

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The leftmost one is a ten-second toothbrush.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
When you open your mouth,

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the machine will clean your teeth in ten seconds.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is the leftmost one.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The middle one is the 8K VR glasses.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The rightmost one is the first smart watch in the world.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
These three are on Kickstarter.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I want you to guess which one is more creative.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In terms of natural language processing,

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
which one is more creative?

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Which one gets the most money?

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you use consumer questionnaire,

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
which one is more likely to be chosen by consumers?

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:37,000
At this time, I want to cut it back.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Everyone guessed it.

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
One person said he thought it was VR.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The other three said it was a toothbrush.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Four people said it was a toothbrush.

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
More and more people chose the toothbrush.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
More and more people chose the toothbrush.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is quite interesting.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I also want to brush my teeth clean in ten seconds.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's wait another 20 seconds.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay.

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to tell you that the screen has turned white again.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let me check the comments.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let me take a look.

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Two people said it was VR.

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The other three said it was 567.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
About seven people said it was a toothbrush.

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let me switch back.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let me announce the answer.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sorry, my mouse...

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can't see my mouse.

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, there it is.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Announce the answer.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The mouse on the far left has the lowest amount of money.

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The mouse on the far right has the highest amount of money.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
However, if it is processed by a natural source and a questionnaire,

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it will be the opposite.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
As everyone voted,

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
everyone prefers a ten-second toothbrush.

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If it is processed by a natural source,

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
the ten-second toothbrush is the most creative.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You may think,

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
how can it be like this?

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It looks like a great product.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How can it have such a low amount of money?

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Next, I will introduce it.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This product is recognized as one of the most creative products in history.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It is our iPhone.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Before Apple launched the iPhone,

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
it failed about 12 times.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Except for iPod, Macintosh, and Apple II.

147
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It failed about 12 times.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Among these 12 times,

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
there are 9 products.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I listed them here.

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
These 9 products have something in common.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They all have something in common.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
In fact, there is something in common

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
on the iPhone.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But the iPhone didn't fail.

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And this feature

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
became the selling point of the iPhone.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It became the selling point of the iPhone.

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's review it.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There are Newton, Lisa,

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Apple TV, and palm-shaped computer.

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There are many reasons for the failure of these products.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But they have one thing in common.

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The iPhone has it, too.

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's too expensive.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Frankly speaking,

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I personally think

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the design of the iPhone is really amazing.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But in terms of business strategy,

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
especially in terms of pricing,

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
it is a completely wrong strategy.

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Because it failed 9 times in a row.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is definitely not a coincidence.

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is definitely the consumer's preference.

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So we can see that

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
if a creative product

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is priced too high,

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the probability of failure is very high.

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Even a genius like Dr. Jia

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
can't save this thing.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Next,

183
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
before I solve this problem,

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
let me introduce the natural resource processing tool I use.

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This tool is called

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
latent semantic analysis.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a very interesting field in AI.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's called latent semantic analysis.

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This language analysis

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
assumes that

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the similar text

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
between text and text

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
is less creative.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If these two words

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
are far apart on the language network,

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
if the probability of it appearing in the same article

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
is relatively low,

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
then we assume that it is more creative.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Because you think of something

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
that others may not think of.

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
People rarely connect

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
10 seconds with machines and tools.

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So of course,

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
it is more creative.

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Latent semantic analysis,

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
in addition to being used in this creative field,

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
it can help you sort your articles.

208
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You can throw about five sentences.

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
After five sentences,

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
it may divide you into two concepts.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
In these two concepts,

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
there will be a lot of words below.

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can see that

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the meaning of the A group of words is closer.

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The meaning of the B group of words is closer.

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The result may be different from what you think.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So if you are interested in LSA,

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
you can search on the Internet

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and try it.

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is LSA.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This picture is a bit out of place.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
To put it simply,

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
this is a screenshot of a paper.

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This paper was written by

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
a professor at UNC,

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Kurt Gray.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He led a paper.

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He measured creativity with words.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The green one below is Low Creativity.

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He asked the audience

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to write words

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
with their own ideas.

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They kept writing and writing.

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They tried to write something creative.

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
For example,

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
this group below

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is called Grape, Strawberry, Fruit.

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
These are all fruits.

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is very close.

240
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
In terms of definition,

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
we can say that it is less creative.

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
For the above,

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Grease, Slick, Sick, Nelsia, Ocean, Glass,

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
it seems that

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
they appear in the same article.

246
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We define that

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
this person

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is more creative

249
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and more imaginative.

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
After introducing

251
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the method of measuring creativity,

252
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
let's go back to the previous question.

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why do we like creativity

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
when we do

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
paper research,

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
but we don't like it when we actually buy it?

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
As you just saw,

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
if you do paper research,

259
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
when you actually

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
talk about it,

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you will choose

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
creative products.

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Computers can also measure this.

264
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But if you put it

265
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
on the website

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
or sell it

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
directly on the market,

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
sometimes

269
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
these very novel products

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
are not sold well.

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why is this?

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Because

273
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
we are actually

274
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
very

275
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
risk-averse.

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
When a product is

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
different from others,

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
consumers

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
like your creativity.

280
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But on the other hand,

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
you have to think that

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
your product is very creative,

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but because it is new,

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
we have never seen you before.

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We will have uncertainty.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Uncertainty will produce

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
another thing called risk.

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Let's take

289
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Kickstarter as an example.

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Kickstarter is a fundraising website.

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Before your fundraising amount

292
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
reaches the target,

293
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
it will not be sold.

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Your money may be invested

295
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and it may be reimbursed.

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because the investment failed,

297
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
it can't be sold.

298
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
At this time, consumers will measure

299
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the risk.

300
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If I buy your product,

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
aka invest in your product,

302
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
will it evaporate

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
or not be sold?

304
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So when your product is

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
very novel,

306
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
on the other hand,

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
people will be a little scared

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and dare not buy it.

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When I asked my friends before,

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I got a similar result.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My friends also chose this way.

312
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Their reason is that

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
they really want to buy it,

314
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
but it is too expensive.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This is what people think.

316
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is very strange.

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So,

318
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
do we like

319
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
creative products

320
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
or hate creative products?

321
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is very strange.

322
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It means that

323
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
our attitude has changed.

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We like it and we hate it.

325
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I want to cut this thing

326
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
from the level of

327
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
behavior economics.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
In behavior economics,

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
there is a thing called

330
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
conversion preference.

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
These two economists

332
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
did research in 1973.

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When we

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
choose a product,

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
if its price

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
is fluctuating,

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
we will put the

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
high and low rankings

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
of this price

340
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
to make a conversion.

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
A is better than B,

342
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
but after the price adjustment,

343
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
B is suddenly better than A.

344
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is very contradictory

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
to traditional economics.

346
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No matter what,

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
A is good.

348
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No matter how the price changes,

349
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I will definitely choose it.

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
This is the development

351
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
of behavior economics.

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This is a small experiment.

353
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Which plan do you

354
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
prefer?

355
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We are now

356
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
investing in a plan

357
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
to save African children.

358
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We spend $1,000 to save

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
100 children's lives.

360
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We feed them.

361
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is the first plan.

362
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Or we use

363
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
$2,000

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
to save

365
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
300

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
African children's lives.

367
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This is very

368
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
intuitive.

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The proportion is not equal.

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
$2,000 can save

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
300 lives.

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The return on investment is higher than the previous plan.

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There is no doubt.

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Moreover,

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
life is priceless.

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You can't use money to measure life.

377
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It is reasonable to

378
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
choose A.

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
However,

380
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
if

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
today

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I cover

383
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A plan

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to save 100 lives,

385
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
B plan to save 300 lives,

386
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
A plan is $1,000,

387
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
but

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I cover

389
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
B plan $2,000,

390
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I ask you

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
if you save 300 lives,

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
how much money

393
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
do you think the government

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
should spend to

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
save these lives?

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
However,

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
usually

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the beneficiary will answer

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the price lower than $2,000.

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
For example,

401
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
$1,500, $1,400, $1,300

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
will not

403
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
jump to $3,000.

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They will

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
use your $1,000

406
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to save 100 lives.

407
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is

408
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Daniel Kahneman

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and Tversky's

410
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
anchoring bias.

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
When you are given a set amount of money,

412
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you will make some mistakes later.

413
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You will not

414
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
multiply

415
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
100 to 300,

416
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
1,000 to 3,000.

417
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We will save a little

418
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
$1,500, $1,600 will not

419
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
jump to $2,000.

420
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
This is the anchoring bias

421
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
in behavioral psychology.

422
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Let's go back to

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the product

424
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
of creativity.

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Psychologists

426
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
do a series

427
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
of experiments

428
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
on creativity

429
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and risk.

430
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
There are two groups of beneficiaries.

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The first group

432
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
is the control group.

433
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It presents a product

434
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
that is not creative like the iPhone.

435
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The beneficiary uses

436
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
an attitude test

437
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to connect

438
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the creative product

439
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
with positive words,

440
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
such as happiness and warmth.

441
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The positive words are connected.

442
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The negative words

443
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
such as disgust and ugliness

444
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
are separated.

445
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The other group

446
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
does the same experiment.

447
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The beneficiary gets a creative product

448
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and assigns

449
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
positive words to the creative product.

450
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The negative words are

451
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
far away from the product.

452
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Creativity

453
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is very social.

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
In theory,

455
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
if you don't talk about it,

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
everyone will think

457
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
that you like creative products.

458
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The more, the better.

459
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The more, the better.

460
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Whether it's business or other aspects,

461
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
as long as this person is creative,

462
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
everyone thinks it's great.

463
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The attitude test is implicit.

464
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It doesn't affect

465
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
your social expectations.

466
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If you have a different view

467
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
from the society,

468
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
it can be tested.

469
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This is the so-called

470
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
inner attitude test.

471
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's talk about

472
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
the experiment group.

473
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What is the behavior

474
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
of the other group?

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
There is a balloon

476
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
next to the iPhone.

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The experimenter

478
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
will accidentally

479
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
poke the balloon.

480
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The balloon will explode.

481
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
When the balloon explodes,

482
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
the beneficiary will hear the sound.

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The beneficiary will be surprised.

484
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The sound is enough

485
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
to scare the beneficiary.

486
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
After the beneficiary is scared,

487
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
there is a little cash in the balloon.

488
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It means

489
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the money is yours.

490
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
In other words,

491
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
you don't know how the balloon will explode.

492
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The sound will scare you.

493
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You will feel disgusted.

494
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
After this uncertainty,

495
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
there will be some cash.

496
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It simulates

497
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
the creative

498
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and high-risk creativity.

499
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
They asked the beneficiary

500
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
to do an inner attitude test.

501
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
As a result,

502
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the experimenter

503
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
found that

504
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the group without balloons

505
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
have a good relationship

506
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
with the beneficiary.

507
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But the group above

508
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
had a different experience.

509
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The group above

510
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
has an inner attitude.

511
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They are not

512
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
so close to the beneficiary.

513
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Their relationship

514
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
with the beneficiary

515
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
will be easier.

516
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The beneficiary will feel disliked

517
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and sick.

518
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Faced with

519
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the high risk

520
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
of scaring people,

521
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
our attitude

522
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
towards entrepreneurship

523
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
will change.

524
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So,

525
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
our attitude towards entrepreneurship will change.

526
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
How do we explain this?

527
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This is

528
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
based on

529
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
the reversal bias of

530
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
the group above.

531
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Let's say

532
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
you want to choose a handsome guy

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
to be your partner.

534
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I will present

535
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
three options.

536
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The first one is Tom Cruise.

537
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The second one is Joe Kerman.

538
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The third one is Elon Musk.

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Tom Cruise is more handsome

540
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
than Joe Kerman.

541
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Joe Kerman can sing

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and he is also handsome.

543
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He also acted in a movie.

544
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Elon Musk is also

545
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
one of the candidates.

546
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
However,

547
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
if you compare Elon Musk

548
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
with Tom Cruise,

549
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Tom Cruise is not

550
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
as handsome as Elon Musk.

551
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Some people

552
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
may think

553
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Elon Musk is

554
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
an entrepreneur

555
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and he is smart.

556
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
He is smarter than Tom Cruise.

557
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So,

558
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
people will choose Elon Musk

559
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
over Tom Cruise.

560
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So,

561
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
A is greater than B,

562
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
B is greater than C,

563
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
but C is greater than A.

564
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
This is a magical inequality.

565
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
This is

566
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
the experiment

567
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
of Daniel Kahneman,

568
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
his partner,

569
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
who did

570
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
a classic

571
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
economic experiment.

572
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You may think

573
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
how to calculate

574
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
the weight of power.

575
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Is smart more important

576
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
or handsome?

577
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Or is it as important

578
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
as Joe Kerman's dancing?

579
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Which one is more important?

580
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It is strange.

581
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
We have to use a mathematical formula

582
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or it is illogical.

583
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This is

584
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
what I learned

585
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
from YouTube.

586
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It is

587
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
a course

588
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
by Amos Tversky

589
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
in 1981.

590
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It is called

591
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Measuring Inequality.

592
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It was

593
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
uploaded to YouTube

594
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
in October 2019.

595
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It is called

596
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Measuring Inequality.

597
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He wrote

598
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
this proof.

599
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It is

600
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
9, 13, 19 points.

601
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's interpret it

602
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
as a product's quality

603
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
or creativity.

604
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
9 points of creativity, 13 points of creativity, 19 points of creativity.

605
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Of course,

606
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
19 points of creativity is higher than 9 points of creativity.

607
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It is unquestionable.

608
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What about the left?

609
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The left is the price of the product.

610
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No one

611
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
wants to buy things with 30 dollars.

612
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Try to use 10 dollars.

613
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So,

614
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
our preference is

615
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
from left to right,

616
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
from top to bottom.

617
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Then,

618
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
we multiply

619
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
these six numbers

620
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
by 9.

621
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We use

622
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
the product's

623
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
quality score

624
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
to multiply

625
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
the product's price.

626
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Let's say

627
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
13 times 30 is

628
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
390.

629
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Let's take 390

630
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
as a general attitude.

631
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Overall,

632
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
how much does he like this product?

633
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
For

634
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
normal logic,

635
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
let's look at the orange arrow.

636
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The orange arrow is normal logic.

637
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It is

638
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
from top to bottom.

639
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The lower right corner

640
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
is

641
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
the lower

642
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
the score.

643
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
We can use

644
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
lower cost

645
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
to buy this product.

646
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
This is normal logic.

647
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
However,

648
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
under certain conditions,

649
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you can see the middle

650
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
line.

651
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
There is a god logic.

652
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It will

653
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
show 270

654
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
to 260.

655
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We call it

656
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
risk.

657
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
In this case,

658
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
we don't care about the risk.

659
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We don't care.

660
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
270 is high risk.

661
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
If

662
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
there is a god logic,

663
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
how does it work?

664
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
On the left,

665
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
we multiply

666
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
by

667
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
10.

668
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We multiply

669
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
by 10.

670
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
On the right,

671
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the growth rate

672
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
is not that high.

673
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
On the left,

674
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
30 and 10

675
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
are 3 times higher.

676
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
9 and 19

677
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
are not 3 times higher.

678
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Let's assume

679
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
we don't care about

680
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
creativity.

681
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We don't multiply.

682
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The price is double.

683
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The number of creativity

684
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
is not

685
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
the growth rate.

686
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
In this case,

687
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
the matrix

688
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
will be

689
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
multiplied by

690
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
the god logic.

691
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Under certain conditions,

692
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
we are afraid of

693
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
the risk.

694
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Under certain conditions,

695
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
we don't care about the risk.

696
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It is

697
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
hard to understand.

698
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So,

699
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think it is better

700
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
to use crisis analysis.

701
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
In general,

702
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
we have the same

703
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
statistical chart.

704
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We have the same

705
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
preference for a thing.

706
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So,

707
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
we draw a straight line.

708
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
However,

709
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
our preference for creativity

710
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
is not a straight line

711
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but a curve.

712
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
At first,

713
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
we like creativity.

714
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
However,

715
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
as the price goes up,

716
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
we only go from 9 to 19

717
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
instead of 27.

718
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So,

719
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
our creativity

720
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
is not a straight line

721
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
but a curve

722
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
on the chart.

723
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So,

724
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
it is close to the concept of crisis.

725
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
As you know,

726
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
behavioral economics

727
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
shows the preference

728
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
for a thing

729
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
in the way of crisis analysis.

730
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Traditional economics

731
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
is a curve.

732
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It is a straight line.

733
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It is very intuitive.

734
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
However, human beings are irrational.

735
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
When the price

736
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
goes up to a certain level,

737
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the preference

738
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
for a thing

739
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
becomes smaller and smaller.

740
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
This is the difference

741
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
between traditional economics

742
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and behavioral economics.

743
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
In fact,

744
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
it lacks professional knowledge.

745
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I asked a senior

746
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
how to explain

747
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
the curve

748
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
to a manager.

749
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
He said

750
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
it lacks domain expertise.

751
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You need professional knowledge.

752
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You can't explain it

753
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
to your manager

754
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
with your professional knowledge.

755
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is the concept of curve.

756
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
To sum up,

757
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
if your idea

758
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
is very novel,

759
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
you should

760
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
lower

761
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
your price.

762
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Don't raise

763
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
your price.

764
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
People will be afraid.

765
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
They will think

766
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
your idea is good

767
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
but

768
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
on the other hand,

769
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
if your idea

770
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
is very low,

771
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
you should

772
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
use your imagination.

773
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
For example,

774
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
when a YouTuber

775
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
uploads a video,

776
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
the cost is low.

777
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So,

778
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
if you want to be a successful YouTuber,

779
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
you need to

780
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
use your imagination

781
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
to make your video popular.

782
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
For example,

783
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
if your video

784
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
has 10 views,

785
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
but none of them likes you,

786
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
the 10th video

787
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
happens to

788
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
hit a certain person,

789
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
the person

790
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
likes your video

791
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and your subscription

792
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
goes up.

793
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
This is the strategy.

794
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
If you don't join the membership,

795
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I will click your video

796
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
to watch.

797
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
On the other hand,

798
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
if you are a high-cost YouTuber

799
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
who is conservative,

800
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
you want to satisfy

801
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
all your subscribers,

802
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
the success rate will be low.

803
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
In general,

804
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
people don't want to watch

805
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
funny and boring videos.

806
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
These are the references.

807
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The first one

808
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
is a paper

809
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
about

810
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
measuring creativity.

811
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
The second one

812
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
is

813
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
a book

814
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
about creativity.

815
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
There is a Chinese version

816
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
of the balloon experiment.

817
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You can check it out.

818
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's very interesting.

819
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The third one

820
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
is Originals.

821
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's written by

822
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Alan Grant.

823
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The Chinese translation is

824
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
版判.

825
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's very interesting.

826
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It describes

827
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
the risks

828
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
of creativity.

829
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It describes

830
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
how creative people

831
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
are.

832
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Alan Grant is

833
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
an excellent psychologist.

834
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The next one is

835
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Justin Byrne.

836
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
He specializes in

837
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
predicting creativity.

838
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He predicts

839
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
whether creativity

840
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
will be successful in the future.

841
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's very difficult.

842
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But he did it.

843
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
He is really strong.

844
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The next one

845
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
is

846
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
a paper

847
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
on behavioral economics.

848
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It was first published

849
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
in 1973.

850
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's called

851
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Experimental Psychology.

852
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The last one

853
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
is

854
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Daniel Kahneman's

855
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
partner,

856
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Amos Tversky and

857
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Richard Seiler.

858
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's about

859
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
anomalous preference reversal.

860
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's about

861
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
why our preferences

862
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
are so amazing.

863
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
A is greater than B,

864
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and B is greater than A.

865
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's amazing.

866
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
There are many

867
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
details in the paper.

868
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
If you're interested,

869
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
you can

870
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
look it up.

871
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That's

872
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
all for

873
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
my presentation.

874
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Any questions?

875
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Any questions?

876
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
If you have questions,

877
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
you can ask them directly.

878
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yes.

879
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I have a question.

880
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You just

881
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
drew a picture.

882
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You said creativity

883
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
is not limited

884
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
to people.

885
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It's increasing

886
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and becoming more and more attractive.

887
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
For example,

888
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
is there any experimental

889
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
approach

890
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
or someone trying to

891
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
analytically model it?

892
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
For example,

893
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
is there any way to

894
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
quantify

895
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
creativity

896
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and make it a axis?

897
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Another axis is

898
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I can somehow quantify

899
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
attractiveness.

900
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Then I can

901
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
quantify

902
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
the green line.

903
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I think

904
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
this model is OK.

905
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But I'm doing

906
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
document analysis and

907
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
data science analysis.

908
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So I haven't done it

909
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
in the lab.

910
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'll figure it out

911
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
in the future.

912
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
OK. Thank you.

913
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Any questions?

914
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
If you have

915
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
other questions,

916
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
you can unmute

917
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
yourself.

918
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Then you can ask.

919
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
If you have questions,

920
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
you can unmute yourself.

921
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Hello?

922
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Can you hear me?

923
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm Anping.

924
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I have a question.

925
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Your speech

926
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
was very interesting.

927
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I didn't hear

928
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
what you said

929
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
about data science

930
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
in the beginning.

931
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
How does data science

932
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
contribute to creativity?

933
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But I heard

934
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
data science

935
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
contributes to

936
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
future direction,

937
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
possibility,

938
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
traditional experiments,

939
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
behavioral economics,

940
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and experimental psychology.

941
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Can you tell us

942
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
more about

943
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
data science

944
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
playing a special role

945
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
or future role?

946
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And you seem to have the result.

947
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You said you have data to predict.

948
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Is it something like that?

949
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Thank you.

950
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
At that time,

951
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I was purely

952
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
analyzing

953
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
the website

954
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
provided in the paper.

955
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
The result of the analysis

956
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
is the total amount

957
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
of data

958
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
on Kickstarter

959
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and the paper.

960
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's called Forward Flow.

961
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's related to

962
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
negative.

963
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So,

964
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I think data science

965
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and psychology

966
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
are interlinked.

967
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You will see

968
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
something different

969
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
from your common sense

970
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
or domain knowledge.

971
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
At this time,

972
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
you have to think

973
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
whether

974
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
there is something wrong

975
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
with this program

976
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and whether

977
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
common sense is biased

978
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
or domain knowledge needs to be modified.

979
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You need to have

980
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
a little intuition

981
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and professionalism.

982
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
If you find that

983
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
this is against

984
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
common sense,

985
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
but it has

986
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
the academic theory

987
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
of creativity to explain it.

988
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
However,

989
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
there is a theory to explain it,

990
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
but it's still

991
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
in the academic theory.

992
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So,

993
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
this is a space for development.

994
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You can

995
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
use

996
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
this kind of

997
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
computer program

998
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
to run some data.

999
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You can copy and paste at the beginning.

1000
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If you find that

1001
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
it's against common sense

1002
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and domain knowledge,

1003
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
you can think about

1004
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
whether this is

1005
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
a good question

1006
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
for future research.

1007
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Can I ask another question?

1008
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You mentioned

1009
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
data science

1010
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and the difference

1011
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
between it and domain knowledge.

1012
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm not sure

1013
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
if you know

1014
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
what data science is.

1015
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I don't even know what it is.

1016
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Can you explain

1017
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
what kind of

1018
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
way data science

1019
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
looks at these issues?

1020
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I don't know what it is.

1021
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Thank you.

1022
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This question

1023
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
is a bit difficult.

1024
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Let me use another PowerPoint

1025
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
to explain.

1026
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
This is another research I did.

1027
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I went to

1028
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Cambridge Analytica.

1029
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
If you know

1030
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
how to steal

1031
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
data from Facebook,

1032
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
you should know

1033
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
what Cambridge Analytica does.

1034
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
A group of data scientists

1035
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
steal text from Facebook

1036
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
to predict your personality traits.

1037
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Their research

1038
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
is in conflict with

1039
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
domain knowledge.

1040
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
How do we

1041
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
explain this phenomenon?

1042
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Data science

1043
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
is the third

1044
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
block,

1045
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and it's the most important.

1046
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
LSA,

1047
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Latent Semantic Analysis,

1048
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
doesn't use

1049
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Bayes' Theorem to calculate.

1050
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It calculates

1051
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
the relationship between

1052
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
words and words,

1053
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
not cause and effect.

1054
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Cambridge Analytica

1055
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
does use cause and effect.

1056
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Here,

1057
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
they use LSA

1058
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
plus probability.

1059
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
D stands for text.

1060
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Z stands for topic.

1061
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
W stands for word.

1062
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
This word

1063
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
has a chance

1064
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
to appear

1065
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
in this document.

1066
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is

1067
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
the probability.

1068
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
If I appear

1069
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
in this topic,

1070
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
what is the probability

1071
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
that I appear in this word?

1072
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
If I appear in this document,

1073
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
what is the probability

1074
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
that I appear in this topic?

1075
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
They use Bayes' Theorem

1076
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
to calculate.

1077
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Here,

1078
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
we can explain

1079
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
these two things

1080
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
in the same way,

1081
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but the difference

1082
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
in the algorithm

1083
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
causes the difference

1084
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
in the data structure.

1085
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Let's use

1086
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
LSA's Theorem.

1087
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Let's look at

1088
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
a set of data.

1089
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
We can see

1090
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
this large piece of data

1091
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
as Cambridge Analytica.

1092
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
We can see

1093
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
this large piece of data

1094
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
as Cambridge Analytica.

1095
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
If you divide it

1096
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
into popular singers,

1097
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
the popular singer

1098
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
is related.

1099
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
However,

1100
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
the popular singer

1101
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
is only a small piece

1102
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
in all creative people.

1103
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
If you add

1104
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
a conditional probability,

1105
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
you can cut

1106
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
this small piece

1107
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
of data.

1108
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I tried to

1109
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
explain in math.

1110
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I tried to explain in math.

1111
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I tried to explain in math.

1112
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
This is the mathematical proof

1113
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
of the Tversky hypothesis.

1114
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
This is the Mathematical proof of the Tversky hypothesis.

1115
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I used this mathematical proof

1116
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
to explain

1117
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
the question of

1118
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
computer science

1119
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and

1120
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
the knowledge of creativity

1121
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
.

1122
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
.

1123
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000

1124
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000

1125

1130

1131
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000

1132
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000

1133
