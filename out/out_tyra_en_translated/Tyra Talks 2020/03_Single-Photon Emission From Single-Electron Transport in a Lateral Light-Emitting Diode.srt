00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome everyone to the Taira Talk on April 11th.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,000
We are honored to have Xiao Zhigang to give us a speech.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today's topic is

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Single Photon Emission from Single Electron Transport

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
in a Soul-Driven Lateral Light Emitting Diode.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It seems to be related to quantum computation.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Our speaker today studied in Hsinchu.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He went to a research institute in NTU.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He said that his research results were mainly in thermonuclear conduction.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
After graduating from the institute, he studied in the UK.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now he is doing his PhD in QTEC at Daft University in the Netherlands.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Before we start, let's give our speaker a round of applause.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please remember to turn on your microphones first.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's give the floor to Xiao Zhigang.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No matter where you are, I hope you are all safe.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What I'm going to talk about today is mainly my work as a PhD in QTEC.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was published in Nature Communication in February this year.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The citation is here.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you are interested in more details, you can refer to this paper.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure about the level of the audience today.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Or maybe everyone's field of expertise is different.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I'm not going to go very deep today.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I will use some more straightforward methods to express.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you have any questions, you can ask directly.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you have questions online, it will be more interactive.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Today's main work is to introduce a new or a new way to produce single-ray.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We use a surface wave in a structure similar to an LED to produce a single-ray.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Today's topic is mainly about quantum communication.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Quantum computing is what I am studying and researching in QTEC in the Netherlands.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If I have a chance later, I will share it with you.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Anyway, today is mainly about quantum information technology.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What kind of applications does quantum information technology have?

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I believe everyone has seen the movie.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Quantum technology can make people shrink or travel through time and space.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Avengers tells you that quantum mechanics can achieve these things.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But here I can tell you that these are all nonsense.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
These things have nothing to do with quantum mechanics.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Anyway, now the movie is that no matter what it is, if you can't explain it, just use quantum mechanics.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay, let's get serious now.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So today is mainly about quantum communication.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The main thing that quantum communication is doing is basically written very clearly in this review paper.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Quantum communication is basically the technology of transferring a quantum state from one place to another.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In quantum information, the traditional quantum state is carried by light.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The so-called light is the basic example of light.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In quantum communication, we use light to carry a quantum state.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So if you can produce a single light, you can use this single light to carry a quantum state.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:03,000
One of the applications of quantum information is the so-called quantum key distribution.

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Basically, this protocol is a person named Alice.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
She sends a series of light, a series of single light.

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
She encodes the quantum information into the direction of the light.

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The receiver Bob can get the quantum state of this light.

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then she randomly selects and measures the direction of the light.

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Of course, I won't talk about the details.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But through such a protocol, they can establish a quantum key that shares with each other.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
After establishing this quantum key, it can be used to encrypt their information.

57
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The advantage of this protocol is that if a third party tries to steal the information in the process of transmitting the quantum key,

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
they will find out that the communication channel is not safe.

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We should stop and try different channels to do this communication.

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is one of the important applications of quantum communication.

61
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:53,000
More interesting quantum communication often uses a very important feature in quantum mechanics called quantum entanglement.

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What is quantum entanglement?

63
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
For example, there is a quantum state here.

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Its quantum state is a superposition of 0, 0 and 1, 1.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If it is such a superposition, it can send one of the light to Alice.

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Then send the other light to Bob.

67
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When Alice goes to measure the information of this light value, it can be measured to 0 or 1.

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
0 and 1 here is the quantum state of the light value.

69
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
For example, we can make it horizontal or vertical.

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For example, you can define that the horizontal deviation is 0 and the vertical deviation is 1.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
When Alice measures the quantum state, it will randomly get 0 or 1.

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When Bob measures the quantum state, it will randomly get 0 or 1.

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But because these two lights are in a quantum entanglement state.

74
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So when Alice and Bob compare their results,

75
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
they will find that when Alice measures to 0, Bob will also measure to 0.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
When Alice measures to 1, Bob will also measure to 1.

77
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The characteristics of such a quantum entanglement are very important in quantum communication.

78
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Using such an entanglement state can achieve so-called quantum teleportation.

79
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The main reason is that you produce a quantum state of light here.

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then send one side to Alice and the other side to Bob.

81
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Alice will do another entanglement at the local stage.

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In this way, she can teleport the light on her side to Bob.

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
In the process, Alice did not directly throw this light to Bob.

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But she can teleport this light to Bob.

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Another application is that one day we can use a light

86
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
as a bridge between two local quantum computers.

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For example, we can convert the quantum state here into light.

88
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We can transfer this light to another quantum computer through light or air.

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then convert this light to the quantum state of light on the local quantum computer.

90
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In this way, we can achieve a far-end connection between two quantum computers.

91
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We can also use light as a quantum component in quantum computing.

92
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We can use the quantum state of light to do quantum computing.

93
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This is mainly some of the main applications in quantum communication.

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In all these applications, there is a very important...

95
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Can you see the screen here?

96
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is it blocking the title?

97
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No?

98
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
OK, it's fine.

99
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
OK, it's fine.

100
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In all these applications, there is a very important component, the so-called single light source.

101
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You must have a light source that can emit a light.

102
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
When you want it to emit a light, it will emit a light.

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can trigger it to emit a series of light.

104
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
They are separated in space and time.

105
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What is the difference between a single light source and a general light source?

106
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,000
First of all, we can imagine that a classical light emitter is like a water spray gun.

107
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When you press it, it will spray out millions of water molecules.

108
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
For example, you can't control that I only spray one water molecule at a time.

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But the single light source is a bit like a pistol.

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
When you trigger it, it will shoot a bullet.

111
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So this is the main difference between classical and quantum light sources.

112
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:15,000
More specifically, the difference is in their light statistics.

113
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Suppose we have a coherent light source, for example, a general laser.

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Its light distribution is positive Poisson distribution.

115
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This means that suppose you have a laser.

116
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's say you have a very small hole.

117
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The light can only pass through that hole very little at a time.

118
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But no matter how you reduce the intensity of the light,

119
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you will find that even if your average light number is 1,

120
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
when you measure its light distribution,

121
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you will find that it is not all the same light.

122
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
40% is 0 light, 40% is 1 light, 20% is 2 light, and 5% is 3 light.

123
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
For example, it is not an on-demand single photon source.

124
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The so-called single photon source, a perfect single photon source,

125
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
will meet the sub-Poisson distribution.

126
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
In a perfect situation, you will find that

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the number distribution of the photon in its light source

128
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
is 100% when it is under 1.

129
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is the biggest difference between classical and single light sources.

130
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In general, most of the so-called single light sources

131
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
are produced in a very simple way.

132
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Hello.

133
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Can I ask a question?

134
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

135
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Can you go back to the previous slide?

136
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In quantum mechanics,

137
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
we have the uncertainty principle of light.

138
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
For any quantity of uncertainty,

139
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
you have delta P times delta R,

140
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
which is greater than the percentage bar.

141
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I imagine that if you have an uncertainty distribution of light,

142
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
which is the standard deviation of light,

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
what is the corresponding delta something?

144
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Phase.

145
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The phase is completely uncertain.

146
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So if you squeeze the light into a single light source,

147
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the phase will have a very large standard deviation.

148
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes.

149
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, okay.

150
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I forgot.

151
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Okay?

152
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let's continue.

153
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay.

154
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The way we produce a single light source on the mainstream

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
is actually very simple.

156
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You prepare a two-level system.

157
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You have a ground state and an excited state.

158
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But the important thing is that in your system,

159
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
you basically can only see at the same time,

160
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
or only control one,

161
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you can only have one two-level system.

162
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If you can isolate a two-level system,

163
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
then you use light or electricity,

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
no matter what, to trigger something.

165
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Are you okay?

166
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You trigger it.

167
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because in your system,

168
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
there is only one two-level system,

169
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
so you can only produce one exciton.

170
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This two-level system will decay in its exciton lifetime

171
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
back to the ground state and produce a single light source.

172
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
After decaying back to the ground state,

173
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you trigger it again.

174
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
In the exciton lifetime, it will decay again.

175
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Basically, you go through this cycle.

176
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then you can produce a single light source one by one.

177
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Basically, the mainstream single light source so far

178
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
basically uses this method.

179
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Of course, there are some that use nonlinear queries,

180
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
which are different.

181
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I won't discuss it here.

182
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A single emitter or two-level system like this

183
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
can be found in many different systems.

184
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
For example,

185
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
let's use a few examples.

186
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
For example, we have a trapped ion.

187
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Suppose you can trap an atom in your cavity.

188
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Because there is only one atom,

189
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
when you trigger it,

190
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
it will emit light one by one.

191
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Or let's say,

192
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
in a diamond defect,

193
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
a nitrogen vacancy,

194
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
such a defect can also be used as a single photon source.

195
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
For example,

196
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
in the recently popular 2D Transition Metal Dichrogeny,

197
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
this 2D semiconductor,

198
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you can also use some of its structural defects

199
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
as a single light source.

200
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Another,

201
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
currently

202
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
the most mainstream method

203
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
is to use the self-assembled quantum dot.

204
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The self-assembled quantum dot

205
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
basically looks a bit like

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
you sprinkle some water droplets on a table.

207
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Because of the surface tension,

208
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
these water droplets will be connected one by one.

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
After the connection,

210
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you can cover them all

211
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to form a single quantum dot.

212
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
For example,

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I am now pointing at a single quantum dot.

214
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
These quantum dots

215
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
can also be used as a single light source.

216
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Basically,

217
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
as you can see in this photo,

218
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
there are more than ten quantum dots.

219
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So you have to cover all the other quantum dots.

220
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
For example, just look at this one.

221
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you only look at this one,

222
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
you will find that

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
when you stimulate it,

224
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
you will get a single photon emission.

225
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But quantum dots

226
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
have some shortcomings.

227
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There are some shortcomings in practical application.

228
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
One of them is

229
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
because of the way it grows,

230
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
it is difficult to control its size.

231
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And it is difficult to control

232
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
where it will grow.

233
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
For example,

234
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
this is an example.

235
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You see that these dots

236
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
are randomly distributed.

237
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You can't control

238
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
that I want a dot

239
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to grow in a certain place.

240
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This kind of randomness

241
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
will result in

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
a less ideal

243
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
composition.

244
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Another point is

245
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
when you use light

246
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
to stimulate a quantum dot,

247
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
you may get

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
a bi-hexatone emission.

249
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Because of the binding energy of the bi-hexatone,

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
you will see that

251
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
its energy and hexatone energy

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
are a bit different.

253
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
In this case,

254
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
you have to use a spectrum filter

255
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to cover the bi-hexatone

256
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
so that you can get

257
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
a pure single photon emission.

258
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

259
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
OK.

260
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So this is the mainstream method.

261
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What I'm going to talk about now is

262
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that we want to try

263
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
a method that has been proposed

264
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
for 20 years

265
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
but has not been done

266
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
before this paper.

267
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Basically,

268
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
what we want to do is

269
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
to mix two things together.

270
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
OK.

271
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Basically,

272
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
you can think of it as

273
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
a LED and a wave.

274
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This is a wave.

275
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm using a wave now,

276
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
but in practice,

277
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it's a wave.

278
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We combine a LED

279
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and a wave.

280
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
With some special device production,

281
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
we can achieve

282
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
a single photon emission.

283
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

284
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
OK.

285
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
First,

286
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
let's talk about

287
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
what the LED and the wave are.

288
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sure everyone is familiar with LEDs.

289
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
In Taiwan,

290
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
you can see a lot of advertising boards.

291
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
These things are all made with LEDs.

292
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's easy to find LEDs on the platform.

293
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
OK.

294
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The main structure of LEDs

295
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
is like this.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It has a P-type semiconductor.

297
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There are a lot of electrons in it.

298
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Electrons are

299
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
how to say

300
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
lack of an electron.

301
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You can compare it to a hole.

302
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's like an electric hole.

303
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Here,

304
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
there is another N-type.

305
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This section

306
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
mainly has a lot of electrons.

307
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If we combine the electron and the electric area,

308
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
we will have a P-N junction.

309
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The P-N junction

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
looks like this

311
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
in the conduction band and the valence band.

312
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
OK.

313
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
When you want them to glow,

314
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
what you have to do is

315
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
apply a forward bias

316
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
so that the electron and the electric area

317
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
can overcome

318
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
the potential barrier.

319
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
When you apply a sufficient forward bias,

320
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
the electron will flow to the electric area

321
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and the electric area will flow to the electric area.

322
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Then you can

323
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
combine them in this place.

324
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
When the electron sees the electric area,

325
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
it will decay

326
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and combine with the electric area

327
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to produce light.

328
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
This is a very simple

329
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
LED

330
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
way to produce light.

331
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's very simple.

332
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Why can't we

333
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
LEDs

334
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
generate single light?

335
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Because when you

336
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
add a forward bias,

337
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
you don't let

338
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
one electron

339
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
combine with one electric area

340
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
at a time.

341
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
At the same time,

342
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
you can't control the number.

343
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Suppose

344
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
we can't

345
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
make a LED

346
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and

347
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
when you

348
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
trigger it,

349
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
it will only have one electron at a time.

350
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It will only have one electron at a time

351
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
to combine with the electric area.

352
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
In this case,

353
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you can imagine

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that it should

355
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
produce single light.

356
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
OK

357
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Then

358
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
OK

359
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So we talked about

360
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
a way to

361
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
transmit an electron at a time.

362
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
In this experiment,

363
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
the technique we used

364
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
is a surface wave.

365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
A surface wave

366
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is basically

367
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
a wave.

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But this wave

369
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
will produce a dynamic

370
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
electric potential.

371
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This potential

372
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
can carry electrons.

373
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's like a wave.

374
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This wave can carry electrons

375
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
to overcome a potential barrier.

376
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
After overcoming it,

377
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
you can control

378
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
the amplitude of the surface wave.

379
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You can control

380
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
how many electrons you need to carry at a time.

381
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So

382
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in theory,

383
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
if we can

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
carry one electron at a time,

385
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
we can

386
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
let only one electron

387
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
reach the electric area at a time.

388
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Then we can produce a single light.

389
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
OK

390
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What about

391
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
the surface wave?

392
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
In Taiwan,

393
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
we've all experienced it.

394
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
A surface wave

395
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
is caused by

396
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
an earthquake.

397
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
A part of the wave

398
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
is transmitted by a surface wave.

399
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
A surface wave

400
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
has a low frequency but a high amplitude.

401
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So it's highly destructive.

402
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's like

403
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
a wave

404
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
transmitting on the surface.

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
OK

406
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
OK

407
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
As I said,

408
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
in general,

409
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
we've all experienced an earthquake.

410
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So how can we

411
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
produce a surface wave

412
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
on a small device?

413
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We need to

414
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
use the so-called

415
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
opamp.

416
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The so-called opamp

417
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
is

418
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
when you

419
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
add an electric field,

420
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
it will cause a change in shape.

421
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
At the same time,

422
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
when it causes a change in shape,

423
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
it will also cause an electric field.

424
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
OK

425
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So we

426
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
use this opamp

427
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
to produce

428
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
a surface wave

429
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
on our chip.

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The method is

431
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
as shown here.

432
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We have

433
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
a cross section

434
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
of an electric field.

435
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The cross section

436
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
of the electric field

437
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
determines

438
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
the frequency

439
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
of the wave

440
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
when it

441
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
transmits

442
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
on the surface.

443
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
OK

444
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
When you have

445
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
something like this,

446
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
when you send an AC signal,

447
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
an RF signal,

448
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and a GHz signal,

449
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
when it meets

450
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
the resonance frequency

451
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
of the transducer,

452
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it will produce a surface wave.

453
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The so-called resonance frequency

454
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
means that

455
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the change in shape

456
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
produced by

457
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
each electrode

458
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
causes

459
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
constructive interference.

460
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This wave will

461
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
pass through here.

462
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
OK

463
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So

464
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
when we

465
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
use this

466
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
surface wave,

467
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
our material is

468
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
gallium arsenide.

469
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Gallium arsenide

470
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
has the property of

471
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
suppressing materials,

472
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
so we can directly

473
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
produce a surface wave on it.

474
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We can use this

475
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
potential wave

476
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to move electrodes.

477
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
An experiment I did

478
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
in my previous group

479
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
is that we have two conductors,

480
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
one on the left, one on the right,

481
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and one on the left.

482
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
At the same time,

483
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
there is only one electrode inside.

484
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The experiment I did

485
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
is very interesting.

486
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I can send a surface wave

487
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
in this direction,

488
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and push this electrode

489
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
to the left.

490
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I can also send a wave

491
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
from left to right,

492
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and push this electrode to the right.

493
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It can move like a table tennis ball.

494
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
They demonstrated

495
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
that they can

496
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
move 60 times.

497
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This kind of technology

498
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
is actually

499
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Sorry

500
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Can you hear me?

501
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yes, I can.

502
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I have a question.

503
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm a high-performance engineer,

504
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
so I have a question.

505
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
How large is the potential

506
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
of the electrode

507
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
you draw below

508
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
the surface wave?

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's basically

510
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
gigahertz.

511
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Gigahertz.

512
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes, it's gigahertz.

513
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The electrode you carried

514
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
is said to be

515
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
as close as possible to

516
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
the gap between

517
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
the surface wave and the electrode.

518
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Is it better

519
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
or worse?

520
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You don't want it to be bigger.

521
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You want it to be

522
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
just the right size.

523
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Basically, you want it to pass

524
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
the steepest

525
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
potential barrier.

526
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
At the steepest point,

527
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
it will only leave one electrode.

528
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's just right.

529
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It depends on

530
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the size of the surface wave.

531
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Okay.

532
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
How large is the scale?

533
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't know much about semiconductor.

534
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's probably

535
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
a few

536
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
MeV.

537
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's m, right?

538
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes.

539
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Okay.

540
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Okay.

541
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Okay.

542
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Thank you.

543
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You're welcome.

544
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I have a question.

545
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay.

546
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Here,

547
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
in the transport

548
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
experiment,

549
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
from left to right,

550
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
what is the

551
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
distance

552
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
transmitted?

553
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The

554
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
length scale here

555
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is one UAM.

556
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So, have they

557
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
tried...

558
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
5 to 6 microns.

559
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
5 to 6 microns.

560
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So,

561
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
this experiment was done

562
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
at low temperature.

563
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yes.

564
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You have to be able to

565
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
define a quantum dot with an electrode.

566
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, you have to

567
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
do it at low temperature

568
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
to see the discrete state.

569
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's probably

570
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I forgot.

571
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's probably 1K or 200

572
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
microns.

573
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay, got it.

574
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I also have a

575
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
question.

576
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That is,

577
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
does this wave

578
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
need to be horizontal or vertical?

579
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The second question is

580
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
that

581
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the electrode is very small.

582
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So, the electrical field

583
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
it feels locally should be...

584
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
If your wave is

585
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
symmetric,

586
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
the electrical field it feels should be

587
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
oscillating back and forth.

588
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So, do you need to

589
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
make the surface acoustic wave

590
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
as asymmetric

591
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
so that it has a

592
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
directional run?

593
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
No.

594
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
No.

595
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, it just followed the first wave?

596
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yes.

597
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay.

598
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Does this

599
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
surface acoustic wave

600
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
need to be horizontal or vertical?

601
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It produces...

602
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Let me think about it.

603
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It produces...

604
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It should be

605
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
horizontal.

606
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Acoustic should be horizontal.

607
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Acoustic can be horizontal

608
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
or vertical.

609
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But it produces...

610
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I don't know.

611
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I don't know.

612
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I don't know

613
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
if the transducer

614
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
produces a horizontal or vertical wave.

615
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Okay.

616
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I think...

617
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't know if I have it here.

618
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So, we can

619
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
see it like this.

620
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Actually,

621
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
the direction

622
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
is like this.

623
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Circular.

624
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Okay.

625
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So, it's mixed together.

626
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes, it's mixed together.

627
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's really like water.

628
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yes, it's mixed together.

629
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So, it's not just a wave.

630
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yes.

631
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Okay.

632
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So, I hope

633
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I answered your question.

634
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yes.

635
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay.

636
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Last question.

637
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Can this

638
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
produce a standing wave?

639
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes, it can.

640
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Yes.

641
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So, if I produce a standing wave

642
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and there is a transducer

643
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
on both sides

644
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and produce a standing wave,

645
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
is it possible...

646
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Because now

647
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the speed of the wave

648
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
should be

649
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
similar to

650
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the speed of

651
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
the semiconductor.

652
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes, but if there is

653
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
a transducer on both sides,

654
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
if you change the relative phase

655
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
on one side,

656
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you can basically move

657
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the wave slowly.

658
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yes.

659
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Can you do it?

660
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I think I can do it.

661
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yes.

662
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It won't be limited to this.

663
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay.

664
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yes, I think I can do it.

665
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes, I think I can do it.

666
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But...

667
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I think I forgot who said that.

668
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But I don't think I have

669
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
done this before.

670
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes.

671
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Okay.

672
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I have a question.

673
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yes.

674
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
How do you make sure

675
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that is a single electron?

676
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
How do you measure it?

677
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So,

678
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
a structure like this

679
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
has two quantum dots.

680
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
One on the left, one on the right.

681
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But there is

682
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
a channel like this.

683
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There is a channel like this.

684
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
This channel

685
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
has a very sensitive

686
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
conductance.

687
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Basically,

688
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
if there are 0, 1, or 2 electrons,

689
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
it will affect

690
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the channel conductance.

691
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So the way to measure

692
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the number of electrons

693
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
is to measure

694
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
the channel conductance.

695
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It can

696
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
tell if there are

697
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
0, 1, or 2 electrons.

698
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes.

699
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This is a very

700
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
common technology

701
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
in gate-defined quantum dots.

702
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's called charge detector or charge sensor.

703
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay, thank you.

704
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Okay.

705
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Is this QPC?

706
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This is QPC.

707
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Okay.

708
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This is QPC.

709
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If you want to have another quantum dot,

710
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
you can use charge sensor.

711
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But it's easier to do it in this experiment.

712
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Okay.

713
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's okay.

714
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I just want to make sure.

715
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Okay.

716
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Okay.

717
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So, I mentioned

718
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
that I combined two things.

719
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
LED and surface wave.

720
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let's combine these two things.

721
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We want to

722
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
combine these two things

723
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
to produce a surface wave.

724
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This is how we do it.

725
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'll show you an animation later.

726
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But I'll use my mouth to explain.

727
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'll

728
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
make a LED first.

729
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I have electrons here.

730
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I have electrons here.

731
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I have electrons here.

732
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'll make a surface wave.

733
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
This surface wave

734
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
will modulate

735
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the potential of conduction band

736
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and valence band.

737
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
What's more,

738
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
an important component

739
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
is that

740
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I want to create

741
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
a 1D channel

742
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
in the middle of

743
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
the electromagnetic field.

744
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This 1D channel

745
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
can control

746
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
the width.

747
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Basically,

748
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
you can add two side gates

749
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
to control the height of the potential.

750
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You can control

751
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
the width of the channel.

752
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You can control

753
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the width of the channel

754
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
so that only one electron

755
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
can pass through.

756
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
If only one electron can pass through

757
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and produce a surface wave,

758
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
let's assume

759
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
that the potential

760
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
between the electromagnetic field

761
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and the wavelength

762
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
allows the surface wave

763
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to produce a single light

764
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
when only one electron

765
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
can pass through.

766
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Now I have an animation.

767
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I hope you can

768
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
watch it smoothly.

769
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
This is my device.

770
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
This is my device.

771
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
This is the

772
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
energy diagram.

773
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
This is the

774
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
electromagnetic field.

775
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This is the 1D channel.

776
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
The potential of this 1D channel

777
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
is controlled by the side gate.

778
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
When I hit the surface wave,

779
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
it will start to push the electrons.

780
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The electrons will push

781
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
forward.

782
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Because of the channel,

783
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
only one electron can pass through.

784
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
When this electron is combined

785
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
with an electron,

786
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
it produces a single light.

787
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The potential will carry

788
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
the next electron.

789
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So it will produce a single light

790
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
one by one.

791
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This is

792
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
how I

793
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
produce a single light.

794
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Any questions?

795
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I think you will

796
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
talk about it later.

797
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So,

798
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
the gate on both sides

799
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
control the Fermi level

800
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
so that

801
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
both sides

802
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
are electric.

803
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yes, I will talk about it later.

804
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I guess you will talk about it later.

805
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Sorry to interrupt you.

806
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So next I will talk about

807
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
how to make this device.

808
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Basically,

809
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
what's interesting about this project

810
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is that I don't need

811
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
a random quantum dot

812
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
or a defect.

813
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
This device

814
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
can be

815
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
fabricated

816
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
deterministically

817
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
in any

818
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
place I want.

819
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What it needs

820
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
is

821
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
very conventional

822
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
photolithography and

823
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
electromagnetic electron.

824
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You don't need

825
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
any random

826
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
thing.

827
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
This kind of

828
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
device is

829
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
good for

830
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
software integration.

831
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So,

832
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the starting point is

833
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
GaN and

834
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
AuGaS's quantum web.

835
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I didn't show

836
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
the diagram here.

837
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It is

838
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
a plane

839
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
that allows

840
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
electrons and electrons

841
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
to exist.

842
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
First of all,

843
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the next step is

844
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
to pattern

845
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
two surface gates.

846
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Here is a surface gate

847
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and here is another surface gate.

848
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
These two surface gates

849
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
are used

850
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
to accumulate

851
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
electrons and holes.

852
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
For example,

853
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
if I want to

854
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
generate electrons here,

855
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I just add a positive

856
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
voltage to this gate

857
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
to accumulate electrons.

858
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Here,

859
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I just add a negative voltage

860
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to accumulate electrons.

861
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
When I add the voltage,

862
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I can control

863
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
electrons and holes.

864
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
What's more convenient is that

865
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
electrons and holes

866
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
are controlled by voltage.

867
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I can even

868
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
swap them.

869
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I can have electrons

870
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and holes on both sides.

871
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
This is

872
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
a flexible

873
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
device.

874
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Next,

875
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I just mentioned

876
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
that I need a 1D channel

877
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
so that

878
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
each time

879
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
only one electron

880
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
can pass through.

881
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I will make an etch.

882
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Basically, I will use

883
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
the method of 10 electrons

884
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to eat up

885
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
the electrons and holes

886
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
where electrons and holes

887
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
can exist.

888
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The dark part

889
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
of electrons and holes

890
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
can't exist.

891
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Therefore,

892
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
they can only pass through

893
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
the middle path.

894
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe

895
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the etched channel

896
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
is still too wide.

897
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I may need to add

898
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
two side gates

899
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
to control

900
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
the size of

901
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the channel.

902
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
OK.

903
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Next,

904
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
let's search.

905
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Excuse me.

906
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Hello.

907
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I have a question.

908
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You showed the picture.

909
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
How wide is the channel?

910
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Is it sub-micron?

911
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's about a micron.

912
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I will show the device later.

913
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Thank you.

914
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I will show the actual device.

915
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I want to ask

916
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
a stupid question.

917
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The etched channel

918
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
has

919
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
gallium arsenide and

920
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
aluminum gallium arsenide.

921
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It's

922
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
aluminum gallium arsenide

923
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and gallium arsenide.

924
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's a quantum well.

925
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Does the etched channel

926
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
exceed

927
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
the two-deck?

928
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yes, it exceeds

929
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the two-deck.

930
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It exceeds the two-deck.

931
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes, it exceeds the two-deck.

932
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
If you

933
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
control

934
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
the voltage

935
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
below the two-deck,

936
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
does it affect

937
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the width

938
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and narrowness

939
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
of the two-deck?

940
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I think so.

941
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It's right next to the two-deck.

942
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yes.

943
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
OK.

944
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I just thought of it.

945
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Sorry.

946
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The etched channel

947
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
affects the two-deck.

948
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It doesn't affect

949
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
the two-deck.

950
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It affects the two-deck.

951
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The two-deck is close to the two-deck.

952
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It affects the two-deck.

953
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yes.

954
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I will continue.

955
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Next,

956
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I want to generate

957
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
a surface wave.

958
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I will make a transducer.

959
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's the one I just mentioned.

960
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's a transverse

961
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
electrode.

962
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
After I add

963
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
a transducer,

964
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I can

965
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
use

966
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
the RF frequency

967
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
to

968
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
generate a

969
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
surface wave.

970
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It will push

971
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the electrode

972
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
to the

973
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
electric area.

974
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
When the electrode

975
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
is pushed to the electric area,

976
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it will

977
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
combine

978
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
with

979
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
one of the electrodes.

980
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The two electrodes will

981
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
form an exon.

982
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
After the two electrons form an exon,

983
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
the two electrodes will decay

984
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
to form a photon.

985
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Basically,

986
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
this is how we

987
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
generate a single-beam.

988
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I just showed you the animation,

989
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
but now I will show you

990
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
step by step.

991
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
This is

992
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
my actual device.

993
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
This is my

994
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
sole transducer.

995
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I use it to generate the sole finger.

996
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This electrode

997
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
is too small, so you can't see it.

998
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But it's basically

999
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
a transverse electrode.

1000
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The gate

1001
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
to accumulate

1002
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
the electron hole is here.

1003
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You can't see it now, but you will

1004
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
see it in the next image.

1005
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It looks like this.

1006
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
This side is for

1007
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
accumulating the electron, and this side

1008
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
is for accumulating the hole.

1009
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
For example,

1010
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
these black spots

1011
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
are where I use

1012
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
VH to remove them.

1013
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
These

1014
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
dark spots

1015
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
are where electrons and electrons can't exist.

1016
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
The surface wave

1017
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
will come from this direction.

1018
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It will

1019
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
pass the electrons

1020
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
to the electron area.

1021
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Next,

1022
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I will talk about

1023
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
the results of the experiment.

1024
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
First, I mentioned

1025
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
that this is basically

1026
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
an LED plus a

1027
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
surface wave.

1028
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I need to make sure

1029
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
that my device

1030
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
works like an LED.

1031
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So,

1032
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
what I am doing is

1033
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I am accumulating the electron

1034
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
on one side, and then

1035
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
accumulating the hole on the other side.

1036
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Then, I can apply

1037
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a source-engineering bias.

1038
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
A bias.

1039
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Theoretically,

1040
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
you would expect that

1041
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
when the bias

1042
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
is greater than

1043
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
the Gaussian bandgap,

1044
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
it will

1045
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
allow the electron

1046
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
to overcome

1047
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
the potential barrier.

1048
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
The same goes for the electron.

1049
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The electron can run to the other side.

1050
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
In this case, you will see the current.

1051
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Basically,

1052
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
the Gaussian bandgap

1053
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
is about

1054
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
1.55EV.

1055
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So,

1056
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
you will see

1057
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
when I apply a bias,

1058
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
when the bias is greater than

1059
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
1.54EV,

1060
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
the current will start to occur.

1061
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Basically,

1062
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
this graph

1063
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
shows that

1064
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
my lateral

1065
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
p-n junction

1066
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
really works.

1067
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
OK.

1068
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
OK.

1069
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Next,

1070
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
when we want to create a source-driven

1071
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
single-photon source,

1072
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
what we need to do is

1073
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
make it unable to shine

1074
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
normally.

1075
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So, what we need to do is

1076
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
reduce the bias

1077
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
to 1.45EV.

1078
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Basically,

1079
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
if I extend it,

1080
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
it's about here.

1081
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So, basically,

1082
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
if you don't do anything,

1083
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
when the bias

1084
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
is kept at 1.45EV,

1085
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
nothing will happen.

1086
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
There will be no current flowing,

1087
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
and there will be no light.

1088
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
OK.

1089
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
When I

1090
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
add an

1091
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
RF signal,

1092
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
an AC signal on the

1093
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
soul transducer,

1094
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
at its resonant frequency,

1095
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
it will produce a surface wave.

1096
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Then you will expect that

1097
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
at the frequency

1098
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
of the surface wave,

1099
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
if it can carry

1100
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
electrons

1101
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
to the electric field,

1102
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
you will see the current.

1103
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
OK.

1104
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Basically, it's like

1105
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
an elevator.

1106
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
When you draw the potential,

1107
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
it will look like this.

1108
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
The blue part is

1109
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
when you don't add

1110
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
the soul,

1111
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the potential will look like this.

1112
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
When you add a soul,

1113
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
it will start to look like this.

1114
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
The soul will move forward,

1115
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and the electrons will move up,

1116
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and bring it to the electric field.

1117
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It's like an elevator.

1118
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's like an elevator.

1119
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
OK.

1120
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Here,

1121
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm showing that

1122
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
when I

1123
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
add RF signal,

1124
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
when I

1125
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
satisfy the soul transducer

1126
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
resonant frequency,

1127
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I will see

1128
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
something happen.

1129
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
At this X axis,

1130
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'm measuring the

1131
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
AC signal frequency.

1132
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Then,

1133
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
at the Y axis,

1134
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'm measuring the current

1135
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
size.

1136
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Basically, you can see

1137
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
that at about

1138
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
1.16 GHz,

1139
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
around 1.16 GHz,

1140
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
you will see a current

1141
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
suddenly generate.

1142
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Other than that,

1143
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
there is no signal.

1144
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
At this frequency,

1145
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we designed

1146
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the soul transducer's resonant frequency.

1147
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So you can see

1148
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that at this

1149
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
resonant frequency,

1150
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
it seems

1151
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
that the surface sound is generated,

1152
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and the electrons

1153
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
are brought from the electron field to the electric field.

1154
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So we see a current generate.

1155
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
At the same time,

1156
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
we can also measure

1157
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
the light signal.

1158
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Now,

1159
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
the blue part

1160
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
is the current,

1161
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and the red part

1162
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
is the light signal.

1163
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You can see that the light signal

1164
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and the current signal

1165
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
are basically matched.

1166
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
At the same frequency,

1167
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I see the current.

1168
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
This current

1169
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
represents the electrons

1170
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
being brought to the electric field.

1171
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Electrons and electrons are combined,

1172
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
so the light is generated.

1173
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You can see that the light signal

1174
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and the current signal

1175
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
are basically matched.

1176
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Because the area of light

1177
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
is only

1178
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
about a microsquare.

1179
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So this is

1180
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
basically

1181
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
to scan the light signal.

1182
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Then I found that

1183
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I saw light in a very small area.

1184
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Light is generated in this area.

1185
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
This area

1186
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
basically corresponds to

1187
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
the location of the electric field

1188
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
we designed.

1189
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Okay.

1190
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I just

1191
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
described

1192
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
that

1193
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
at this resonant frequency,

1194
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
there seems to be a wave on the surface

1195
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
that causes

1196
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
electrons to be brought to the electric field

1197
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
to emit light.

1198
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But we want to further prove that this is true.

1199
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So what we do

1200
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
is that we have a

1201
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
time-resolved optical setup.

1202
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Basically,

1203
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I want to measure

1204
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
how the light

1205
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
emits

1206
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
over time.

1207
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
How do we

1208
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
do this?

1209
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We have a pulse generator

1210
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and an RF source

1211
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
to drive

1212
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
the wave on the surface.

1213
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
First, we synchronize it.

1214
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Then,

1215
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I synchronize the pulse

1216
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
with the RF signal.

1217
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Then,

1218
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I send the pulse

1219
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
to a

1220
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Time-to-Digital Converter.

1221
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
When the

1222
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
converter receives

1223
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
the pulse signal,

1224
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
it is a stopped pulse.

1225
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Then it starts to count.

1226
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
After it receives the signal,

1227
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
how long

1228
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
will my

1229
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
light detector receive

1230
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
one light?

1231
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Or multiple lights,

1232
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
as long as there is a light signal.

1233
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Once it receives the light signal,

1234
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
it will send a stopped pulse.

1235
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Then the Time-to-Digital Converter

1236
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
will give

1237
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
the time delay

1238
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
between light and pulse.

1239
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
If my RF source

1240
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
looks like this,

1241
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
and if my soul

1242
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
is the same phase,

1243
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
then my

1244
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
photon

1245
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
will be carried

1246
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
by the soul's

1247
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
minimum.

1248
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So the moment it is generated

1249
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
is basically the same as the

1250
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
minimum time.

1251
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
If my RF signal looks like this,

1252
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
then my Time-to-Digital

1253
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Converter's

1254
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
histogram will look like this.

1255
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It will be a signal

1256
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
with a time interval.

1257
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
For example,

1258
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
at 0.5 ns,

1259
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I will have a very strong signal.

1260
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
At 1.5 ns,

1261
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I will have a very strong signal.

1262
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
At 2.5 ns,

1263
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I will have another signal.

1264
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Basically, it will be the same

1265
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
as the RF source's

1266
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
cycle,

1267
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
as well as the soul's cycle.

1268
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Next,

1269
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I want to prove that

1270
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
this signal really comes from

1271
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
the surface wave.

1272
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I believe everyone in Taiwan,

1273
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
because I just mentioned an earthquake.

1274
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
As we all know,

1275
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
an earthquake occurs in Hualien.

1276
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
When you are in Hsinchu,

1277
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
when you feel it,

1278
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
there will be a time interval in the middle.

1279
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
We can use

1280
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
such a time interval

1281
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
to prove that

1282
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
this signal really comes from

1283
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
the surface wave.

1284
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
First of all, my device,

1285
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
its soul transducer

1286
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and my p-n junction,

1287
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
its interval is about

1288
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
1 m.

1289
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I also know that

1290
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
the surface wave's speed

1291
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
on gallium arsenide is

1292
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
about 3000 ms.

1293
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You can calculate

1294
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
its propagation time

1295
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
is about 400 ns.

1296
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So when you

1297
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
hit a pole...

1298
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Sorry.

1299
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We are running out of time.

1300
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I don't know how much time you have left.

1301
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Maybe you should speed up.

1302
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
OK. Thank you.

1303
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
OK.

1304
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So we know that

1305
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
there will be a time delay of 400 ns.

1306
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
What I do here is

1307
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I have a time delay.

1308
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I have a pole.

1309
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I hit the pole's RF signal.

1310
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
When the pole's RF signal

1311
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
is applied to the soul transducer,

1312
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I see that

1313
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
there is no signal.

1314
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But interestingly,

1315
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
after 400 ns,

1316
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I can see a lot of RF signals.

1317
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
This delay

1318
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
proves that

1319
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
this signal is really

1320
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
caused by the soul's

1321
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
propagation

1322
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and the electron's

1323
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
interaction with the electron.

1324
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
What's more interesting is

1325
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
when I zoom in

1326
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
to these RF signals,

1327
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I can see that

1328
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
they are a series of peaks.

1329
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
A pile of peaks.

1330
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The cycle of these peaks

1331
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
is exactly the same as the period of the soul.

1332
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
This means that

1333
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
we are really using the soul

1334
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
to inject

1335
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
each electron

1336
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
into the electric field.

1337
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
This proves that this is really

1338
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
the light signal produced by the soul.

1339
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
OK.

1340
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm almost at the end.

1341
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
In the end,

1342
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
how do we really prove

1343
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
that we produce a single ray?

1344
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
One thing is that

1345
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
when a single ray

1346
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
has two cameras,

1347
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
this single ray

1348
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
can only be seen

1349
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
by one of the cameras.

1350
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It can't be received

1351
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
by two cameras at the same time.

1352
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So it's not received by camera 1,

1353
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
but by camera 2.

1354
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
OK.

1355
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Suppose I have

1356
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
a

1357
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
time series digital converter.

1358
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I go to see its start

1359
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
and stop.

1360
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Because it

1361
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
can only be received

1362
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
by one detector

1363
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
at the same time.

1364
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You will find that

1365
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
when a single ray

1366
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
is really produced,

1367
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
there will be no time delay

1368
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
equal to 0.

1369
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Because time delay equal to 0

1370
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
means that two detectors receive the light signal at the same time.

1371
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
OK.

1372
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So there will be no time delay equal to 0.

1373
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
OK.

1374
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Here is an example.

1375
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
This is a very good single ray on the file.

1376
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You will see a signal like this.

1377
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
When time delay equal to 0,

1378
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
there is no peak.

1379
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
There are peaks in other places,

1380
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
but there is no peak at 0.

1381
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
OK. Now back to my experiment.

1382
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
First of all,

1383
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
when I send

1384
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
more than one light,

1385
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
one electron,

1386
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
through an autocorrelation histogram like this,

1387
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I will see that

1388
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
when time delay equal to 0,

1389
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
there is still a very obvious peak.

1390
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And it's about the same height as everyone else.

1391
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
However,

1392
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
when I control the strength of my source

1393
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and the height of my

1394
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
potential barrier,

1395
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I can control

1396
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
only one electron

1397
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
through each time.

1398
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
On average, there is only one electron

1399
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
combined with the electric current.

1400
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Then it becomes like this.

1401
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You can see that

1402
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
the peak of time delay equal to 0

1403
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
is obviously suppressed.

1404
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's not 0.

1405
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's different from the

1406
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
very good single photon source I showed earlier.

1407
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It's not perfect.

1408
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I can only say

1409
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
that

1410
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
there is still a certain chance

1411
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
that two light will be generated at the same time.

1412
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
But the chance of

1413
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
one light is

1414
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
increased.

1415
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Basically, the signal of time delay equal to 0

1416
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
is suppressed.

1417
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Then I can

1418
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
do a probability estimate.

1419
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I can compare

1420
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
in the same situation.

1421
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Suppose it's a Poisson distribution.

1422
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's a black

1423
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
rectangle like this.

1424
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Suppose

1425
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
it's my source.

1426
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I can see that the probability of a single photon

1427
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
is increased.

1428
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Then the other

1429
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
states of 0 light and multiple photons

1430
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
are suppressed.

1431
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
My experiment

1432
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
shows that

1433
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
because of this design,

1434
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
the probability of

1435
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
increasing single photon emission

1436
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
is increased.

1437
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
OK.

1438
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
These are the results of my experiment.

1439
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Thank you.

1440
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
OK.

1441
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Does anyone

1442
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
have any questions?

1443
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Can I ask a question?

1444
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Sorry.

1445
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
You go first.

1446
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I want to ask

1447
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
how do you think

1448
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
to correct the imperfect part

1449
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
you just said?

1450
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
How do you correct

1451
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
the imperfect part?

1452
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
OK.

1453
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
For example,

1454
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I think there is a problem.

1455
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
The confinement

1456
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
caused by SOHL

1457
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
is not strong enough.

1458
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So

1459
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
this

1460
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
this

1461
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
in this

1462
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
during the transmission of SOHL,

1463
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
the number of electrons

1464
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
is not

1465
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
completely

1466
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
one by one.

1467
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Sometimes it's two or sometimes it's zero.

1468
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I should

1469
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
improve my confinement

1470
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
so that

1471
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
the probability of

1472
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
single electron emission is higher.

1473
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That's basically it.

1474
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Thank you.

1475
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
OK. Thank you.

1476
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Can I change my turn?

1477
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
OK.

1478
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
My question is

1479
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I want to

1480
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
use the

1481
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Garmin Ascend to make a

1482
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
dark matter detector.

1483
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Can we contact you later?

1484
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I think there are some bad details

1485
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and some noise.

1486
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
OK.

1487
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
OK.

1488
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Anyway, my question is

1489
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
if you don't use

1490
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
your SOHL to drive

1491
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
the channel,

1492
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
it's like

1493
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
a calibration run.

1494
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Will it leak?

1495
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Will it leak to the other side?

1496
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Will it leak to the other side?

1497
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You can still see it.

1498
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'm not sure what you mean.

1499
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
You said don't use SOHL.

1500
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
You said don't use SOHL.

1501
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yes. Don't use it.

1502
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And you keep measuring.

1503
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Can you measure anything?

1504
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
There should be only background.

1505
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
There should be only background.

1506
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
First of all, there is no light.

1507
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Electronics can't

1508
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
combine with electronics.

1509
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
There will be no light signal.

1510
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So you can see the background

1511
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
on both sides.

1512
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But you can't see

1513
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
the random event

1514
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
of your single photon.

1515
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
The light signal on the other side

1516
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
may not come from the device,

1517
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
but from the environment.

1518
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Yes. But in my scenario,

1519
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't know when it will appear.

1520
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
If I want to use it as a detector,

1521
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I need to know

1522
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
the random event rate.

1523
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
What do you mean?

1524
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
If I don't trigger it,

1525
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
will there be a fake event?

1526
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
What will the fake event look like?

1527
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
What is its source?

1528
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
First of all,

1529
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
the source of the noise

1530
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
may be the detector itself.

1531
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It depends on what kind of detector you use.

1532
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
For example,

1533
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
we use the Avalanche

1534
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
single photon dive.

1535
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Even if you

1536
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
cover all the light,

1537
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
there may still be

1538
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
10 coms

1539
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
every second.

1540
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
These 10 coms are all fake.

1541
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
This has nothing to do with the real signal.

1542
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Of course, there are some

1543
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
fake events.

1544
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So you mean

1545
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
the background counting

1546
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
comes from your

1547
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
APD, right?

1548
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Yes.

1549
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Or if you have a

1550
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
more powerful device,

1551
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
it may also come.

1552
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I imagine

1553
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
there must be a pulse tube

1554
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
in your refrigerator.

1555
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
If the pulse tube keeps shaking,

1556
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
it means

1557
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
you didn't pulse your source,

1558
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and there will still be an event.

1559
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
The frequency

1560
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
should match the resonance frequency.

1561
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Oh, I see.

1562
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I understand.

1563
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
We will keep in touch.

1564
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
This is very important to me.

1565
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Thank you.

1566
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I have a question.

1567
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Oh my god.

1568
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The light coming out now

1569
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
has no bias.

1570
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The bias and phase

1571
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
are all random.

1572
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Is it possible

1573
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
to hold the gate

1574
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
and make some micro-structures

1575
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
to further control

1576
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
the light's bias

1577
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
or phase?

1578
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Phase may be more difficult,

1579
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
but if it's bias, it's possible.

1580
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
There are some ways.

1581
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
For example, you can do spin injection.

1582
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
For example, the electrons

1583
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
you inject

1584
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
are more of a spin.

1585
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
For example, a large spin out.

1586
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
If you use

1587
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
this method,

1588
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
if the electrons you inject are all spin out,

1589
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
it will produce a corresponding polarization.

1590
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It will produce a corresponding original bias.

1591
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Someone has also

1592
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
done this.

1593
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Maybe you can add

1594
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
a non-parallel

1595
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
electrode.

1596
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Using its spin-orbital interaction,

1597
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
you can also use it to

1598
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
rotate the electron's

1599
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
spin direction.

1600
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
You can also use this

1601
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
to control its spin direction.

1602
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
At the same time, you can also change

1603
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
the light's polarization.

1604
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Okay.

1605
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
What about phase?

1606
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I think it's

1607
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
more difficult.

1608
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Okay.

1609
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Got it.

1610
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Cool.

1611
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Thank you.

1612
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Hello, I have another question.

1613
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Okay, thank you.

1614
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

1615
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
It's a bit like the RLFrequency.

1616
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
There are two pictures.

1617
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
One is

1618
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
the picture with less frequency.

1619
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
The other is

1620
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
the light.

1621
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Right.

1622
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
There are

1623
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
four peaks

1624
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
in the middle.

1625
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
What is the corresponding

1626
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
polarity of these peaks?

1627
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
This is

1628
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
because

1629
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
when you

1630
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
play RF signal,

1631
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Is it the polarity of your pulse?

1632
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Let me explain why.

1633
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
The reason is

1634
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
when you play the pulse,

1635
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
you also produce

1636
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
EM wave.

1637
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
It's like an antenna.

1638
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
It also acts as a radio.

1639
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
These peaks

1640
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
are caused by the interference

1641
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
between the radio and the pulse.

1642
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I see.

1643
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Okay.

1644
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I see.

1645
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I see.

1646
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I see.

1647
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I see.

1648
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I see.

1649
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I see.

1650
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I want to follow up

1651
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
the question of the tab.

1652
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
You said EM wave is produced

1653
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
in this.

1654
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
My question is

1655
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
what is the impact of EM wave in this area?

1656
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Basically,

1657
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
this is related to

1658
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
the time result measurement I just showed.

1659
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You can see

1660
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
if EM wave itself can drive

1661
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
this signal,

1662
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
you will see that the signal

1663
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
will produce at the same time

1664
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
because the speed of light

1665
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
is much faster than the speed of the soul.

1666
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So if there is a signal,

1667
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
you will see that there is a signal

1668
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
in this place.

1669
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Okay.

1670
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Basically,

1671
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
this tells you that

1672
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
EM wave itself can't drive

1673
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
this charge transport.

1674
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It can't drive,

1675
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
so it can't produce light.

1676
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Only the soul itself

1677
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and its strength

1678
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
are enough.

1679
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
This is a very good question.

1680
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
So

1681
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
in this experiment,

1682
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
how much control do you have

1683
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
on the resonance frequency

1684
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
of the soul

1685
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
or the amplitude?

1686
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Does it depend on the material

1687
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
or does it depend on

1688
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
the transducer you designed?

1689
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Frequency

1690
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
depends on the transducer.

1691
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Basically, it depends on

1692
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
the quality of the transducer.

1693
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You can control

1694
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
how narrow the resonance frequency

1695
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
of the soul is.

1696
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
As for the amplitude,

1697
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
it depends on

1698
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
how much power

1699
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
you add to the RF signal.

1700
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
The more power you add,

1701
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
the greater the amplitude.

1702
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But at the same time,

1703
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
when you add

1704
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
too much power,

1705
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
your sample will heat up.

1706
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
When it heats up,

1707
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
the high temperature

1708
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
for the

1709
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
transport quantized

1710
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
charge state is not a good thing.

1711
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So

1712
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
you can't really add

1713
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
too much power.

1714
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
At the same time,

1715
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
we don't want it to be too large

1716
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
that it can carry more than

1717
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
one electron.

1718
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Then it won't produce light.

1719
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I have another question.

1720
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's about the production of components.

1721
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Yeah.

1722
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
When you're using 10 quantum wells,

1723
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
did you say you're using 10?

1724
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Yes.

1725
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Why did you choose

1726
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
10? Because it's not

1727
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
directional, right?

1728
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Yes, that's right.

1729
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You mean

1730
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
if it's dry edge,

1731
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
the well

1732
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
will be more...

1733
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And like it...

1734
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I didn't try.

1735
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Theoretically, it should be possible.

1736
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
But I didn't do that.

1737
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Because I just saw

1738
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
that SM has a lot of residue.

1739
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Will it cause some

1740
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
gradient decrease or even

1741
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
cause some feedback problems?

1742
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It's also possible.

1743
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It just so happens that

1744
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I didn't do my edge well on this device.

1745
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So it's a little ugly.

1746
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I see.

1747
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Thank you.

1748
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I have a question.

1749
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I have a few questions.

1750
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
The first one is,

1751
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
as far as I know,

1752
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
there's a very important thing

1753
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
about producing single photon source.

1754
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It's the source's dead time.

1755
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
How long can it produce

1756
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
a single photon source?

1757
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Because this is very related to

1758
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
quantum communication.

1759
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Even if

1760
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
you do it very well,

1761
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
every time there's a pulse,

1762
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
every time there's a cycle,

1763
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
there's an electron passing through.

1764
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Then the dead time

1765
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
is about 1 nanosecond.

1766
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Because your frequency is 1 GHz.

1767
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
My frequency is 1 GHz.

1768
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Yes.

1769
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
So its dead time is

1770
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
about 1 nanosecond.

1771
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Is this better than

1772
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
the general single photon source?

1773
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Or is it worse?

1774
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Basically,

1775
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
it's about the same as

1776
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
the best single photon source's

1777
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
repetition rate.

1778
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
The best single photon source

1779
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
can produce 1 GHz to 3 GHz.

1780
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Okay.

1781
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So this has potential.

1782
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yes.

1783
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
The second question is,

1784
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I want to know how to

1785
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
control the

1786
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
one-time-only electron.

1787
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So you have to adjust

1788
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
the gate voltage.

1789
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Is it better to adjust it smaller?

1790
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Or is it better to reduce

1791
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
the number of electrons?

1792
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Basically, the less, the better.

1793
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
In a better situation,

1794
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
you want to see quantized current.

1795
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You want to see

1796
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
when you change

1797
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
the gate voltage,

1798
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
you'll see a quantized

1799
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
quantum.

1800
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Yes.

1801
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
You'll see a quantum.

1802
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
That corresponds to

1803
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
the one-time-only electron.

1804
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Okay.

1805
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
If you can see that, it's better.

1806
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
My device is not perfect.

1807
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I can't see the quantized

1808
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
current quantum.

1809
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I think that's why

1810
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
my single photon emission

1811
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
has a peak

1812
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
that's not really low.

1813
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
The question is,

1814
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
why can't you add

1815
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
a smaller voltage?

1816
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Why can't your device

1817
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
lower the voltage?

1818
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
If you lower

1819
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
the electron density,

1820
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
what happens?

1821
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Can't you see the light?

1822
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
First of all, your signal will be weaker.

1823
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Yes.

1824
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
So you'll need

1825
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
a longer time

1826
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
to accumulate these signals.

1827
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I think it's okay.

1828
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I think it needs to be less.

1829
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Yes.

1830
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Theoretically, it's okay.

1831
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
But that means

1832
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
on average,

1833
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
on average,

1834
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
the electron density

1835
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
in the cycle

1836
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
is 1.

1837
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
In that case,

1838
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
first of all,

1839
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
even if

1840
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
your source

1841
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
is a gigahertz frequency,

1842
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
the light you emit

1843
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
won't have

1844
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
light in every cycle.

1845
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Okay.

1846
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Yes.

1847
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
That's not

1848
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
the case.

1849
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And then

1850
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
the brightness will be lower.

1851
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Yes.

1852
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I think it's okay.

1853
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
You can still

1854
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
bring less

1855
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
electrons

1856
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
in every cycle.

1857
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Of course, it will still emit

1858
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
light.

1859
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So you mean

1860
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
your experiment

1861
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
is basically

1862
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
a one-year experiment.

1863
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So if you spend

1864
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
a year to do this experiment,

1865
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
the G2 value will be lower.

1866
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Yes.

1867
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Theoretically, yes.

1868
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
But...

1869
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I think

1870
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
theoretically, yes.

1871
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Okay.

1872
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
But in practice,

1873
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
you won't want to do this.

1874
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Yes, I understand.

1875
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
The third question is

1876
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
the reason why

1877
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
a single photon source

1878
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
can become a single photon source

1879
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
is because...

1880
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
For example,

1881
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
when an acetone is triggered,

1882
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
it can't trigger the second one

1883
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
because the second one

1884
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
will have a photon blockade problem.

1885
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
The acetone binding energy

1886
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
will be different.

1887
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
What is the mechanism

1888
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
of this device?

1889
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Your channel is narrow enough

1890
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
to allow

1891
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
only one electron

1892
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
to pass through

1893
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
at a time.

1894
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
This is the basic mechanism.

1895
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
This is very different

1896
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
from the single photon source

1897
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
of a single emitter.

1898
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Why don't you

1899
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
use a quantum wire

1900
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
to do this experiment?

1901
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
For example, if you use a quantum wire,

1902
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
it will pass through twice.

1903
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Yes.

1904
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Do you want to

1905
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
collaborate with a German team?

1906
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
This is a good question.

1907
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But we...

1908
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
We want to try it

1909
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
in the future.

1910
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Okay.

1911
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
That's about it. Thank you.

1912
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Thank you.

1913
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Do you have any questions?

1914
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
If not,

1915
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I will turn off

1916
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
the recording.

1917
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Thank you.
