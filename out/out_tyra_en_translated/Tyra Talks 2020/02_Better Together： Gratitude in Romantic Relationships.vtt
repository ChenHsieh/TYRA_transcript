00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, everyone. I'm your host, Sui-An.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm very happy to have you all here today.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm very happy to have you all here today.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
The topic is Better Together, Gratitude in Romantic Relationships.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Before we start, I'd like to talk about two things.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
First, I'd like to briefly talk about how we're going to do the presentation.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Dr. Zhang will have a few segments in the presentation.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
If you have any questions, you can leave them in the chat box.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Or during the presentation, the speaker may pause a few times.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
You can ask questions during that time.

00:55.000 --> 01:05.000
During the presentation, because we're live, I'm going to mute everyone's microphones.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Please understand.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Today's presentation is hosted by TAIRA.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
TAIRA is a non-profit organization.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
We hope that young Taiwanese scholars all over the world

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
will have the opportunity to share their research online.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Whether you're in the same field or in a different field,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
you'll have the opportunity to discuss and learn from each other.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
If you're not a TAIRA member yet,

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
please go to the TAIRA Project website to sign up to become a member.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
If you're already a member,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
we're recruiting speakers for the second half of this year.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Please feel free to register to become a speaker for the second half of this year.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
This is the agenda for today's presentation.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm going to briefly introduce Dr. Zhang's academic experience.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Dr. Zhang currently serves as a post-doctoral postdoc researcher

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
at the Central Institute of Sociology.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Her current research project is called

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Unmanned Mobility-Affected Experimental Situations.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Her main field of research is psychology.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Her research topics include emotions, interpersonal relationships, and culture.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Before she returned to Taiwan to serve as a post-doctoral postdoc researcher,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
she graduated from the Department of Psychology at the National Taiwan University

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
and obtained a bachelor's degree.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
She then continued to study at the National Taiwan University Psychological Research Institute

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
and obtained a master's degree.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
The topic of her master's thesis is actually a continuation of today's topic.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Her topic is how to express gratitude and adapt to a partner's lifestyle.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
After graduating from her master's,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
she went straight to the University of North Carolina in the United States

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
to study for a doctorate degree at the University of North Carolina.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I find her research topics very interesting.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
There are several main parts.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
For example, if we express gratitude in our daily lives,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
does it mean that people from different cultures have different cultural differences?

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
Or, can gratitude make us a better person, a better version of ourselves?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Or, if we talk about intimate relationships,

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
what kind of role do partners play in intimate relationships or physical contact?

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Another part is the so-called self-exceeding emotion.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
What does it have to do with a person's participation in society?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I find Dr. Zhang's research very interesting.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
What's interesting is that it's not a research in a ivory tower,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
but rather how we can apply theory in our daily lives

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
to make psychology a very practical and helpful science for humans.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Before I hand over to Dr. Zhang,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I have a personal story to share with you.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
Dr. Zhang is a very important mentor who led me into the field of psychology.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
When I was in college, I was his research assistant.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I think Dr. Zhang is someone who cares a lot about humans.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
I think his research is not just about knowledge.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
He really cares about how we can make humans a better human being.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So, I won't go into too much detail.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Let's welcome Dr. Zhang to share his useful speech with us.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Thank you.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Thank you, Yian, for the introduction.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It was a very complete speech.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
I feel like I wasn't as serious as I was when I was a host last week.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Thank you very much.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Let's get started.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
The topic of Yian's speech,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Gradually Romantic Relationships,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
was written by me.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
That's right.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
You can see it on PowerPoint.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
If there is an emergency,

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
let me talk about it first.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
If there is an emergency,

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
like if I suddenly lose connection or can't see the slides or something,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
but I can't see everyone's chat,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Yian, please send me a message.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
My phone is next to me.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
You can still see it.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
If there is something like this, please let me know.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
All right.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I wrote the topic myself.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
What you see on PowerPoint now

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
is purely because the word romantic is too long.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It will squeeze the relationship to the next line.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I think it's ugly, so I changed it.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
But most of today's content will still be in Romantic Relationships.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Although it's not just Romantic Relationships,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
most of it will be here.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
This is the first one.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
The second one is

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I don't have much content to prepare today.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So if you're in the middle,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
is there anything you want to clarify?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Or I didn't make it clear.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Then you need to clarify.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Or is there anything you want to discuss?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Some ideas.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
In fact, I welcome everyone to put it out in the middle.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
As for the method,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Yian has already introduced it.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So you can put it out.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
If we have a chance,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
we can discuss it.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
The third one is what Yian just said.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Like my master's thesis.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
It's true that the content I'm going to talk about today

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
is what I've been doing all the way.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
But I'm not going to talk about that today.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
There are some other related studies.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
But I welcome everyone to ask questions.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
We may be able to talk about these past studies

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
during the time of questions.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
I'm going to focus on a few new ones today.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
And then we're actually halfway there.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
The reason is because I don't want to...

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Because I don't know if you've heard of my previous stuff.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm afraid I'll repeat it later.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
It's a waste of time.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
But if you don't know,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
you're welcome to ask questions.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Then we can mention it by the way.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
Okay, let's get started.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay, I'm going to talk a little slower now.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
As Yian just said,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
a large part of my research all the way

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
is about the feeling of gratitude.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
In interpersonal relationships,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
especially in intimate relationships,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
there's a lot of influence

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
between people who are close to each other.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
This kind of emotion,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
which we usually call emotion,

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
is generated from intimacy

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
and how it can be reversed

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
to influence the quality of intimacy, etc.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
In literature,

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
there is a major theory

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
that talks about the function of gratitude

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
in interpersonal relationships and intimacy.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
From a functionalist perspective,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
we're going to talk about its function.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
The conclusion of this theory is actually quite simple.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Gratitude is...

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
The function of its evolution

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
is to help us promote

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
and maintain high-quality intimacy.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
To be more specific,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
this is how it works.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Let's imagine that

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
we're walking around like this in our daily lives.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Suddenly, one day,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
at a certain moment,

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
a person,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
no matter who it is,

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
a stranger, a close person,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
anyone,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
did something to us

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
that is worth praising.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
For example,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
today,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I forgot to bring my keys.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I forgot to bring my keys.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Then I called my wife.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
She said,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
wait for me.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm nearby.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I'll send your keys back.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
She did this for me.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
For me,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
it's very...

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
In terms of evolution...

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
No, let's not talk about evolution.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
For my life,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
it's very useful.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
It's a very effective thing.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
In terms of evolution,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
of course,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
as an individual,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
how can we recognize

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
that these people

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
will do something effective, useful, and helpful to us?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Some people won't.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
We need to interact with these people for a long time.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Don't interact with another group of people for a long time.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
This ability becomes very important,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
very functional,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
and very effective.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
This is why gratitude appears.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Let's say my wife

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
brought my keys back today.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
She just went out

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
and brought my keys back.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Then I'll have this emotion.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
The emotion of gratitude.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
It's a bit like

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
there's a light bulb in my head.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Then it lights up.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
That light bulb is the feeling of gratitude.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
It reminds me

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
that the person I'm interacting with

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
is a good social partner.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
He is a person

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
who needs to interact well

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
in my future life.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
This is the first step.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Okay?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
My feeling of gratitude.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
But just the feeling is not enough.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
What I just said is important.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
How do I fix this person

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
in my future?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
So gratitude

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
will be very natural.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Everyone must have experience like this.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
The feeling of gratitude

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
will naturally

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
produce a grateful expression.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
For example, the simplest

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I would say thank you.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
This is a very natural expression.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Of course, everyone can think of

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
many different ways of expression.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
This is what I just mentioned.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
When I was doing cultural research,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
I was doing cultural psychology research.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Cultural research is another

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
huge field.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So I'm not doing all of it.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
When I was doing cultural psychology research,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I was looking at

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
people from different cultures

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
expressing their feelings of gratitude.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
But no matter which culture it is,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
no matter how it is expressed,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
it is expressed anyway.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Through this expression,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
what I want to do is

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
let my wife

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
know that

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I am a person

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
who knows how to be grateful.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I feel it.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I let her know.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
This is very important

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
because it will let my

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
social partner know

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
that this person

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
is a person who knows how to be grateful.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
So she can recognize

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
that I am working hard for her.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
My efforts for her

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
will not be in vain.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
In the future,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
she will want to

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
interact with me

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
in theory.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
This is still theory.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
She will want to interact with me.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Then we can form a...

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I don't know if this example is good or not.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
But you can imagine

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
that there are two atoms

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
and they are far apart.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
It doesn't matter.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
But slowly they will

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
get closer and closer

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
to each other.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Then they will be fixed

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
as a pair.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
This is the concept.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Then they will be fixed.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
This kind of pair

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
will help a lot

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
when facing

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
the risk of evolution,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
environmental challenges, etc.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
This is the phenomenal level.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
On the psychological level,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
there is a very important concept

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
in the literature.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
It is used to...

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It is a very strong concept

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
that predicts the quality of the relationship

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
and maintains it.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
It is called

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Perceived Partner Responsiveness.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
TPRM.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
How to translate this?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Actually, I'm not sure

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
how to translate this.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Perceived Partner Responsiveness.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
What does this mean?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Let's talk about the first two words.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
It's simple.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Perceived Partner.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
I see a characteristic

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
in my partner.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
This characteristic

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
is called

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Perceived Responsiveness.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
As a person,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I see this characteristic

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
in my partner.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
The first two words,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Perceived Partner.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Something perceiving the partner.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
What is Responsiveness?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Responsiveness is

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
my partner.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I see that my partner

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
wants to take care of me.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
He wants to meet my expectations

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
and needs.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
This motivation

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
is called Responsiveness.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
If I see

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
a quality in my partner

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
that wants to take care of me,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
then I perceive

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
some responsiveness in my partner.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
This is it.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
This is my subjective

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
perception of my partner.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
What kind of person

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
is my partner?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
This is my subjective perception.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
This perception

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
can be found to be

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
a strong factor

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
in maintaining and stabilizing

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
the relationship.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
So,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
on a psychological level,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
the expression of Gratitude

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
conveys

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
the feeling of Gratitude.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
As I said,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
the feeling of Gratitude

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
is to let me know

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
that my partner

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
is a good social partner.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Specifically,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
what kind of partner is it?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
It's a Responsive partner.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
The feeling of Gratitude

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
is like

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
when you book online shopping.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
When you book online shopping,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
a box will be sent to your home.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
The box is Gratitude.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
When you open the box,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
it's filled with Responsiveness.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
It's like a carrier.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
When you open the box,

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
you can see

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
the Responsiveness of your partner.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
On the other hand,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
the feeling of Gratitude

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
when we show it

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
to our partner,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
it's the feeling of Gratitude.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
However,

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
when the box is opened,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
it's also the feeling of Responsiveness.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
Through the exchange of Responsiveness,

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
the relationship stabilizes.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
So,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I'm going to talk about some...

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
This is the theory part.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I'm going to talk about some

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
real-life research

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
to support this theory.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
By the way,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I don't have a lot of videos.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
It's usually like this.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I stop for a night

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
and then I keep talking.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
So if you want this,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
for example,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
a citation

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
or related information,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
you can ask me in person.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
No problem.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Okay.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
There is a research

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
that is done like this.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
I don't know if you know

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
the structure of

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
the American University Sisters' Association.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
In the first week

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
of their freshman year,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
at least in Virginia,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
in the first week of their freshman year,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
at the American University Sisters' Association,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
the little sister,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
the freshman,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
will be assigned

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
to a big sister,

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
for example,

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
a sophomore,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
a sophomore in college.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
But

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
these sophomore students

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
are responsible for

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
taking care of their little sister.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
But

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
the funny thing is

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
that the first week

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
is anonymous.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
So the little sister

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
actually doesn't know

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
who their big sister is.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Only their big sister

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
has to take care of her

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
little sister in silence.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
It's like the Little Angels.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
This is the first week.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Then,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
after the first week,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
there is an opening speech.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
It's like,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
who is your big sister?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Then

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
they will become

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
a pair.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
This research

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
uses this opportunity.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm going to talk about this research now.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
This opportunity

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
during the first week

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
to ask these little sisters,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
how much do you think

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
your big sister

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
takes care of you?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
How grateful are you to her?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Even though you don't know who she is,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
how grateful are you to her?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
How much do you think she takes care of you?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
These two phenomena,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
one is the feeling of gratitude,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
the other is

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
perceived responsiveness.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Then they measure this thing.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Then,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
they use this thing to predict

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and reveal

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
who your big sister is.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Who are the big sisters of these little friends?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
After a month,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
the satisfaction of the relationship between the two parties.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Then he found

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
in the first week,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
the gratitude of the little sister

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
will predict

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
two people after a month.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Two people are

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
satisfied with the relationship between the two of them.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Then this degree is

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
the first week

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
little sister's perceived responsiveness

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
to terminate.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
This is a

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
display of

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
gratitude can predict

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
subjective evaluation of the relationship,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
stability,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
some degree of stability indicators,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
and is a long-term effect of a

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
related study.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
In terms of intimacy,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
there is another study,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
which is very similar.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
He asked the recipient

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
every day,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I remember it was 28 days,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
3 weeks,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
3 weeks,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
21 days,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
every day,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
he asked the recipient to answer

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
gratitude,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
did he express gratitude to you?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Did he express gratitude to you?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Did he express gratitude to you?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
How grateful are you

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
to him?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Then

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
thank you?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
This degree is a

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
display.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Finally,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
how committed are you

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
to the relationship?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
That is to say,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
this is called loyalty.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I think loyalty is a bit strange.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
How serious are you?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
How convinced are you of this relationship?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Then put in this way.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Then you can imagine,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
because it is a long-term

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
study of 21 days,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
so every day,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
if the data is drawn,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
there will be ups and downs,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
high and low.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
So to some extent,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
this study is actually a bit like

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
an experiment,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
or what we usually call a type experiment.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Because if one day I write high,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
that is, I am in the high

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
experimental group,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and then one day I write low,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
that is, I am now in the low experimental group,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
high, low, high, low,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I will have

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
all kinds of experimental situations.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Everyone can imagine this way.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
So to some extent it is a bit like a type experiment.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Of course, such a situation is

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
there are many recipients,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
each group will have many recipients.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
What did they find?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
They found that

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
the first study I just talked about

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
was about

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
grateful, grateful

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
side, accept the benefits,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
grateful to this side of the person.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
But my other

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
study, he found that

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
when my partner expressed gratitude to me,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I accepted the side of gratitude.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
If my partner

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
expressed gratitude to me,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
if my partner expressed gratitude to me today,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
at the same time,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
today I will have more

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
commitment to our relationship.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
on the other hand,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
he supported this theory,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Find, Remind, My Theory,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
this theory,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
it is true that expressing gratitude is effective,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
it can help us fix

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
accept gratitude,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
first good to us,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
and then accept our gratitude

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Then I will talk about the last

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
study,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
the last study, it is a complete

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
experiment, the question he asked

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
was a little different,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
instead of saying that he wanted to

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
examine the phenomenon of this theory,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
that is, on the phenomenon of gratitude,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
can it help us maintain our relationship?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
What he wanted to ask more was

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
what kind of way

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
to express gratitude and maintain a relationship?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
He revealed the past literature,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
he said, you see,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
gratitude can really maintain a relationship,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
but what kind of behavior,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
what kind of action,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
you can even say that it is an action

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
to maintain a relationship.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
In fact, it is a bit like the cultural research I did,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
but he did not ask about culture,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
he did not look at the difference between cultures,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
he looked at whether there was

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
a general action.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
In this

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
literature on interpersonal relationships,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
everyone can try it later,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
there is an action in the literature on interpersonal relationships

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
that can

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
predict the maintenance of

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
this relationship,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
for example,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
when I am talking,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I touch my nose while

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I grab my nose like this,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
or I will be used to grabbing my head,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
or I am used to sitting on the chair,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
what I am doing now is rotating,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
rotating,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
and these are not meaningful behaviors.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Everyone will have something like this

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
when they talk,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
if we imitate this behavior of other people,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
for example, I am talking now,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
then I will grab my nose,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
then you also listen and it seems to be

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
something like that.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
It seems to have nothing to do with what we are talking about.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
But they find that

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
when we have a conversation or

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
one talks, one listens,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
to ask the speaker,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
that is me,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
for example,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
ask me how much I like

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
the person in front of me

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
who listens to me or talks to me.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
People who are imitated

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
will feel that they prefer the person in front of them.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It seems that he and this person

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
have the same pain.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
The two people are

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
relatively close in frequency.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Then this research can

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
be done in the past.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
You call a

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
experimental group,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
then the professor will come

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
and ask him to give him a manuscript,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
casually ask him to speak a little speech.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Then in the process of asking him to speak,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
call the experimental group to imitate his actions.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Imitate his actions without discrimination.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Of course, this research will ask

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
the speaker

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
to say

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
how strange you think the other person is,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
how deliberate

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
you have been,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
how strange you are,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
and if you notice that you are being imitated,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
let's delete it first.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
We only leave those who do not notice

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
and do not feel that they are being imitated,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
but are actually being imitated.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
As a result,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
there is another group,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
the control group,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
which is not deliberately imitated.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
The group of people who are being imitated

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
will prefer the experimental group,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
and in the future

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
they will prefer the experimental group.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
In the past research,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I found this.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Therefore,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I want to talk about this research,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
probably everyone knows

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
what I am going to do.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It is to trigger the feeling of gratitude

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
in the laboratory

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
and then see

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
if the person who has the feeling of gratitude

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
will run to imitate other people's behavior.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Use this kind of

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
secretly imitating, subconsciously

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
imitate other people's behavior

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
to promote the relationship between the two people in the future.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Let's talk about the conclusion first.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The conclusion is, of course,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
suppose

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
my wife sent me the key

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
and I felt very grateful,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
then I said thank you to her.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
In the process,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I may even forget to say thank you,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
but I will start to subconsciously imitate

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
some of her actions.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
After she gave me the key,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
she was going to leave,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
and I started to feel

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
that Zhang Yiping was more friendly,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
and I felt better.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Something like this.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
But the conclusion is this.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I like this research very much.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
This is a team from Singapore

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
in 2015 or 2016.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
He did it very,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
very carefully.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
This is also another feature of

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
good emotional research.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
He will do things very carefully.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
First of all,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
although you can produce a group of

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
grateful groups,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
for example,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
when you give them some benefits

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
when the recipient comes,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
for example,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
give him some money,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
let him feel more grateful,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
then you ask him,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
he will feel good,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
someone gave me money,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I am very happy,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
it feels like one group is more grateful,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
the other group is more ungrateful,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
but at the same time,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
the money is not only grateful,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
there must be some kind of luck,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
or today the sun came out from the west,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
and there are some

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
feelings of surprise,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
but these feelings are not

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
grateful,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
but other emotions.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
So this research team

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
at the same time

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
created several

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
different experimental scenarios

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
to distinguish these different emotions,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
the most important of which

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
is to feel very lucky

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
and feel very grateful.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
The method is like this,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
he first invites the recipient

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
to collaborate with the experimenter,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
he tells the recipient that the

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
experimenter is another recipient,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
but he is actually a collateral,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
he plays a small game with the

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
experimenter,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
and in the process,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
the experimenter and the collateral

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
can work together to achieve the goal,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
or they can compete with each other

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
and see who gets more points.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Then,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
in one scenario,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
he makes the collateral compete with the recipient,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
so the collateral becomes

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
a jerk,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
so everyone hates him,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
this is the most basic baseline.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
In another scenario,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
the experimenter lets the collateral

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
cooperate with the recipient,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
so the collateral becomes a good person,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
but at the same time,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
he also distinguishes two situations,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
he tells the recipient that

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
whether the collateral wants to

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
cooperate with him or not,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
he decides,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
so if he cooperates today,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
he is really a good person,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
he intentionally wants to be good to you,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
if he doesn't cooperate,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
he is a bad person.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
But in another situation,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
he doesn't have much control,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
he just randomly instructs the recipient

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
whether he wants to cooperate with him or not,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
so even if he cooperates with you today,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
his potential regret is that

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
if he cooperates with you,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
it's not his credit,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
it's just the order he received.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
So,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
here they have three groups,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
the first group is the baseline,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
which is a jerk,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
you hate your collateral,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
he doesn't cooperate with you,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
you hate him.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
If he cooperates with you,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
you will feel grateful,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
but if he happens to be instructed

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
to do good to you,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
you will only feel lucky,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
you will not feel grateful.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Then they continue to do this,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
they tell the recipient that

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
this time is over,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
we will go to the second stage,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
it has nothing to do with the first stage,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
but you and the collateral

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
are going to have a dialogue discussion,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
then he is going to see

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
if the recipient is going to imitate

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
the action of this collateral,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and then he found that the lucky group

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
actually did not imitate the phenomenon,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
only the grateful group has,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
it shows that it is not as long as we are happy,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
any positive emotion

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
will produce bonding,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
social bonding behavior,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
there will only be grateful,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
at least luck will not have.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Then,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
how do we measure this

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
imitation?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
He asked

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
this

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
collateral

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
to touch his hair

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
if he had nothing to do,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
and then count

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
the number of times

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
you touched your hair

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
during the second stage of the dialogue.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
There is a

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
configuration here,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
there are viewers who want to provide

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
that the experiment you are talking about

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
has been verified on the operation,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
is there a check of manipulation?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Yes,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
they just asked,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
they later asked

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
at the end of the experiment,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
because sometimes the check of manipulation

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
will not be in the middle of the test,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
they will say at the end

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
what do you feel about this person,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
what kind of emotions do you have,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
and then there are about 20 emotions

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
to ask them to evaluate,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and then it is true that the grateful group

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
is grateful, the lucky group is lucky,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
and then the baseline group

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
is the baseline,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
so there is,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
thank you,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
and then he went to

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
count the number of times

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
he touched his hair,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
and then it is true that he

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
touched his hair more than once,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
but there is a confounding,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
there is another possible

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
explanation,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
he just feels grateful,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
he just can't sit still,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
he likes to move around,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
so he just touched his hair more than once,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
this may not have anything to do with

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
specifically imitating the other person's behavior,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
do you understand what this means?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
As long as I become very active,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and then touch my heart,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I will touch my hair more than once,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
but it doesn't matter if the other person

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
is touching his hair,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
how do you know that it is because

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
the other person is only touching his hair,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
maybe it's just right,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
so they used several different actions

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
, one group is touching his hair,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the other group is touching his nose,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
and then one is touching his ears,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
so what we want to see is

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
if today is going

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
this hyperactivation,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
that is, this kind of

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
explanation that can't sit still,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
then he just has to

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
touch his ears, touch his nose,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
touch his eyes,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
all of them have to go up together,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
there is no variability,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
but if it is an imitation behavior,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
then there is also a variability,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
that is, there is also a variability,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
so much talk,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I found that I talk about this research,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
how to the next page,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
so much talk,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
in fact, the conclusion is that

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I just said,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
gratefulness will be produced

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
through behavioral imitation,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
this bonding effect,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
this is a possibility,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
that talk so much,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
in fact, just want to demo,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
then put it in a variety of ways

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
to control time,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
finally to talk about

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
our own research,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
we can pause

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
it,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
because now just to a section,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
then there are

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
viewers want to ask questions,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I directly open the microphone to ask him,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
please,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
you say,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
he may just become very active,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I keep moving,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
but you can not put him

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
the number of times,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
normalize by the total movement,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
that is to say,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
he changed his hair

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
in all of his actions,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
the proportion of the amount,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
that does not matter,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
he becomes very active,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
this thing,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
then you can not put him

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
the number of times,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
then he becomes very active,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
this thing,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
this is actually a good practice,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
it is also a practice that we often do,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
but indeed this research,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
not this research,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
is the same team

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
of the last publication,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
he did this way,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
but the next one,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
they tried to use the experimental way

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
to do the effect directly,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
not just to control it in a statistical way,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
that is,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
in theory it is feasible,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
but if you can do it,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
that is, I am very powerful,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I can do it,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
so more of that,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
when you see his experimental design,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
wow, this is so smart,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
but you are right,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
indeed a lot of people do this.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Hi,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
my name is Steffie,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I am a PhD student at Nanjia University,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
but I do not have a background in psychology,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
but what I want to ask is,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
you said gratitude,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
this emotion,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
this emotion,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
and gratitude expression,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I think they may have a little different definition,

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
do these two have,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
that is, there is research

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
that shows that they have a proportional relationship,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
or is it possible that someone has this emotion,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
but actually does not express it,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
then it may be more like the definition part,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
because I have read some

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
articles related to emotion,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
and their definitions may be

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
different,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
some people are more focused on

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
physical reactions,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
or in the mind,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
psychological feelings,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I do not know what you think of this,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
and what you think the definition is.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
OK,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
let's talk about the simple one first,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
or let's say the most difficult one,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
this is the most difficult one,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
because this is the most difficult one,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
because this is the most difficult one,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
or let's say the most difficult one,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
the most difficult one is how to define the emotion,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
then how do I define it,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I think only the subjective feeling,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I personally, I personally,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I believe that many people do not say this,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I personally feel that the emotion is the subjective feeling,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I feel very grateful today,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
that thing is called grateful emotion,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I feel very angry today,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
then

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
that subjective feeling,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I call it emotion,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
the rest,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
you can say, for example,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
how do I express my anger,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
that is called grateful expression,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
how do I understand

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
the context of my anger,

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
or the context of gratitude,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
that is my perception,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
part of the emotional perception,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
but I will not put all these things

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
are called grateful,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
are called grateful,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
are called grateful emotion,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
because in fact there is no meaning,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
and this is not the same as the general common people

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
is that there is a gap,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
you have to define that word,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I do not care,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
but this definition is very strange,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
so I would say

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
only the emotional part is,

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
so this also,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
in a way, I guess I also answer your

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
other question,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
is grateful emotion and grateful expression,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
why is it different,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
grateful expression is focused on discussing

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
his physical actions,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
but the emotional part is my subjective feeling,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
okay,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
that two things are not related to it,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I can,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
the data shows that

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
my subjective report,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
how grateful I feel,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
this subjective report

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
with my grateful expression of behavior

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
is really related,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
this is probably not very surprising,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and is highly relevant,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
this is certainly not surprising,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
but I think everyone may not be very surprised,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
that is, this is definitely not related to

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
someone is fake,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
in fact, you do not feel,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
but you must

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
elders

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
give us some

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
gifts that we do not like,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
we have to say thank you to the scalp,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
this kind of thing we also have experience,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
this kind of thing also exists,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
it also explains why it is not related,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
on the contrary, there are many times

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
grateful expression of the situation,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
such as strangers do something to you,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
then you feel very grateful,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
for example, you do not even meet strangers,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
for example,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
he silently put this

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
community hall

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
very clean,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
but you do not meet this person,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
then how to express to whom,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
so this situation is also there,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
so there is no emotional expression,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
so to answer your other question,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
these two things will not be highly related,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
whether it is related,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
whether it can be divided,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
so it is like this,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
did I miss any questions?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
No,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I do not think so,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
I just want to say,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I know they define different,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
I also understand those points,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I do not know if there is a overlapping part,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
what is the overlapping part,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
you are now a bit of it,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
emotion is a subjective feeling,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
so that person himself

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
knows if he has this emotion,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
then the expression

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
may be external,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
you can observe

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
behavior,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
so the two are completely

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
completely separate two things,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
in your mind,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I prefer to be like this,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I just look at it now,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
that is to say, Mark said that emotion

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
is a system,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I know a lot of people have this

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
angle, but I do not

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
say that emotion is a system,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I would say that there is a system of

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
emotion around

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
gratitude,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I want to say that gratitude is a good emotion,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
there is an expression next to it, there is an observation next to it,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
there are cognitive components next to it,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
there are context components,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
there are even cultural components,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
it has a system,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
this is what I can agree with,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
but emotion is a system,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I want to say this,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
many people say this,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
you walk on the road,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
see how people use the word emotion,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
no one uses it like this,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
if you don't use it like this,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
you have to define it like this,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I think it's a bit deliberate,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
and

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
it's not necessarily helpful,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I think,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
this is my own comment,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
but I'm sure a lot of people

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
outside will say that emotion is a

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
system,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I think it's a bit different.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Yes, I probably understand that angle,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I have seen some related

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
articles before,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
some people will argue that

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
sometimes emotions

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
appear subconsciously,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and sometimes they follow subjective feelings,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I have seen this kind of statement,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
so I want to ask

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
what the people in the background really think, thank you.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
But I can't

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
represent everyone

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
to talk about this matter,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
but I personally

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
always feel that the field of

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
emotional research is independent

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
or has relative independence,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
because it has feelings,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and it has very strong subjective feelings,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
this is why we call it emotional,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
if you say there is an emotion,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
he can't feel it,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
then we say that it is a different

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
psychological state,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
no normal person would call it emotion,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
it's weird,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I don't know what I mean,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
so next I want to tell you

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
this research,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
this is a more

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
exploratory research,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
we want to

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
ask a question,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
thank you,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
indeed,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
my partner and I,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
both can promote interpersonal relations,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
past research has also found,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
past research has also found some

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
physical mechanism,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
or

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
behavioral mechanism,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
but these components

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
between

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
independence

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
how about it,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
how much overlap between them,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
so we have to ask this question,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
in this research,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
we found more than 200 couples,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I think it's

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
400 to 500 people,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
we both

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
came early,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
then ask them to

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
record every day,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
did the other person

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
say thank you to me today,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
pay attention to this behavior,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
did you say thank you to me,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
did I receive the other person's

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
gratitude, both

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
people hit, so you can see

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
received by me

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
and received by my partner,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
then there is express,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
it seems to be gone,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
it's gone,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
but I can't see the video,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
wait a minute,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
OK,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
this is a slide,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
so

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
in the 14-day process,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
we ask both people

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
to record every day,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
did you express your gratitude to me,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
did you say thank you to me,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
at the same time,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
did you say thank you to your partner,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
you can imagine,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I thank my partner,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I say thank you to my partner,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
it's a pair,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
it's just the same event,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
then from two different angles,

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
two different people's

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
perspective,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
so these four measurements

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
can be paired like this,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
from me to my partner,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
and vice versa,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
my partner can also flow back like this,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
so it's two pairs,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
then we take these four

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
events

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
to predict every day,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
we also ask the receiver

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
to answer every day,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
how satisfied are you with

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
your relationship with you today,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
and then there is,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
yes, that's it,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
and then we can calculate

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
ups and downs,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
like the design of the experiment,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
then we use these four events

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
at the same time to predict

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
every day,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
ups and downs,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
the result can be seen,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
that is,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
the same one,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
let's say it's a gratitude episode,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I thank you,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
then you are thanked,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
the same episode,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
you say I thank you,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I say I thank you,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
from the perspective of two different people,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
then we found that

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
this is what I say,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
now the green one is what I say,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
you thank me,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
then I say I thank you,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
then this is what you say,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I thank you,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
then this is what you say,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
you thank me,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
we found that these four

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
are enough for my

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
prediction effect,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
and it is an independent

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
prediction effect,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
what does this mean?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Yes, I will feel better,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
my relationship will be better,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
what does this mean?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Let's talk about these two green ones first,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
these two are more intuitive,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
these two are

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
if you thank me, I will feel happier,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
this is a bit of nonsense,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
you thank me, I feel happier,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
this is very intuitive,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
if you thank me, I will feel happier,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
this is very intuitive,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
because there should be something good happened,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I have to thank you,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
so I should be happier today,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
but we found that

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
this green one

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
means

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
you thank me,

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
you say you thank me,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I will be happier,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
and this thing is independent of

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
whether I say you thank me,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
although I say no,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I did not notice,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
do you thank me?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Although my reaction today is like this,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
this invisible thank you

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
will still reflect

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
my satisfaction with my relationship today,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
do you understand?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
This is invisible,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
because this thing is independent,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
our research has made it independent,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I say you thank me,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
although I say no,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
the part you say will still reflect

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
my satisfaction with my relationship,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the more strange thing is that

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
the audience asked

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
how to record

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
or measure

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
the so-called thanks

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
, how to do

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
the more objective part

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
We use binary measurement,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
so yes or no,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
do you thank others?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Yes or no,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
we let both of them answer,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
so we can stack their data

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
from left to right,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
it is a binary measurement,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
this is more strange,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
you say I thank you,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
although I say no,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I do not remember,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
this is strange,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
because it is independent of my expression,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
at the same time I will feel happier,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
although you say I thank you,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
but I say I do not remember,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I will feel happier,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
we have an explanation for this thing,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
because everyone can see

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
this relationship,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
we draw it like this,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
let it become a loop,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
you think I thank you,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
then you will express to me,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
then you will do something

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
to make you a better partner,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
so it will become,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I will get a better partner,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I will feel happier,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
this is a long shot,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
this is an explanation,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
we have not tested yet,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
but this is a possible explanation.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
At the same time,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I finished this chapter to ask you a question,

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
at the same time,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
we also measured

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
the relationship between

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
these beneficiaries

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
the degree of satisfaction

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
for their own lives,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
not for this relationship,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
but for the overall life,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
there is the same effect,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and this effect is completely

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
terminated by relationship satisfaction,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
here I want to stop

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and ask you a question,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
we have a question

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
here,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
he wants to ask about the binary part,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
then ask Felix directly,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
is Felix there?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Hello,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I am Felix,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
the question I want to ask

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
is related to the binary part,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
because now the senior

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
is asking

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
if they feel it,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
my question is

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
how many times a day

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
do you throw it out

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
and ask him

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
if he feels it?

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Or ask him after the day

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
to recall how many times he received

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
and how many times he thanked?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
This is a good question,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
we only ask once a day,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
before going to bed,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
did this happen all day?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Okay, thank you.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Hello,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I have another question,

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
where is this done?

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
What is the background of the object?

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
These people

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
are in

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Beka

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Triangle

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
so the object

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
is the person living there,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
who is it?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Anyone over the age of 18,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
basically anyone over the age of 18,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
if I remember correctly,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
the youngest couple,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
the youngest victim

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
is 18 years old,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
our low standard,

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
we ask them to be 18 years old,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
the oldest is

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
67 years old,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
if I remember correctly.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
OK, thank you.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I think this should be

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
supplemented,

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
you can imagine,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
if our age range is so large,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
their relationship should be very large,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
just started dating for a month,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
married for 20-30 years,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
so this range is

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
a nice range.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Is there any question from the audience?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
If not,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I have a question myself,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I would like to ask the senior

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
in this study,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
do you have any control,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
which is the main

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
confounding?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Yes,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
this is also a very good question,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
we ask him every night,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
do you thank people,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
have you been thanked,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
we actually asked a bunch of

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
different things,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
some of them are more important,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
in the past, it was also found that

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
the satisfaction of the relationship

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
is a very important prediction,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
including whether the other party

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
has done half of the plus,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
we are not asking this,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
we are asking if there is

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
a fair amount of plus or something,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
anyway, it is a similar wording,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
fairness, reciprocity,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
this is very important,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
this is basically

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
the most important component of

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
subjectivity is difficult to say,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
but subjectivity and reciprocity are very important,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
we have control of this,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
the result is the same,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
we also have control of

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
whether the other party is very polite,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
how do we say

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
courteous,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
we have control of this,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
so gratitude is not

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
purely fair,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
gratitude is not purely

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
polite,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
we also control self-disclosure,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
did the other party tell you something,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
did you tell him something,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
so it's not like this,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
because it's not necessarily a matter of gratitude,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
sometimes it's just a boss,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
but in the past,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
it was found that it was quite effective

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
to do it together,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
so we have to control this,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
and then we also control

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
whether the other party

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
performed very positively today,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
in general,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
are you a happy person,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
control is purely positive,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
it seems that any positive

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
mood is possible,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
we control it,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
so it doesn't matter,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
so gratitude is not just happy.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Thank you, the audience here has a question,

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Felix, please ask,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
hello, I'm Felix,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I just asked a question,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
then I want to ask one more question

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
for the one just now,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
the mayor is now the last day,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
the last day to ask him if he is grateful

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
or grateful,

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
so I want to ask,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
so there is no measurement of the number of gratefulness?

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
No,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
OK,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
thank you,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
this is a very good question,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
because in experience sampling,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
because our approach is

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
more like experience sampling,

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
that is to say,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
continuously and then constantly

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
for the audience who do not know this method,

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I think Felix may know,

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
for the audience who do not know this,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
experience sampling

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
at what time to measure,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
then how densely measured the frequency,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
this is very important,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
because you will catch

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
different research questions,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
this thing,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I wait a minute,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I can think about it now,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I didn't talk about it now,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I'll talk about it later,

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
for me, everyone will know

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
how to catch different research questions,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
especially different

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
temporal scope research questions,

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
do we still have time?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
That is now

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
about to go,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
it's almost 9.30,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
see if there is any time

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
on the senior side

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
to arrange or think about it.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
OK, I will finish this time in 5 minutes,

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
then we will finish, OK?

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
OK.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
The next research

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
is very similar

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
to the previous research conclusion,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
we just want to make the effect of gratitude

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
into an experiment,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
not just observation,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
in addition, we use

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
not only subjective

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
subjective assessment of

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
relationship satisfaction,

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
we use a more objective assessment,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
that is, how much time

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
do you spend with your partner

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
? Why do we choose this

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
objective assessment?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
For this

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
animal research,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
more experienced friends

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
should know,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
we are studying this

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
mouse, when the mousetrap

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
this

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
two mice together,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
stay together for how long?

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
That is, we measure whether they have bonding,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
so

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
the strength of their bonding strength,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
human bonding strength,

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
to a certain extent,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
can be measured in this way,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
and this can help us pull our research to

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
animal research,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
then this is a second

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
is that we use the experiment

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
so this experiment

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
is the way to measure

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
the first two weeks,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
the first 14 days,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
we asked them to go home

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
and do the same as just

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
this report,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
this report is how much time

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
you spend with your partner,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
how much time you spend today,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
no matter what you do,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
anyway,

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
and then go to the lab

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
to do the experiment,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
there are two groups,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
one group is that we

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
remind him to go home

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and remember to thank him,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
remember to say thank you,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
another group is that we

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
give him a little nudge

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I'll talk about later,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
but then put them home,

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
then they record four weeks,

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
28 days,

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
every day you spend with your partner

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
how much time together,

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
then we want to see

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
these two groups

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
after receiving the experiment

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
from the front to the back,

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
there is a group that has increased,

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
a group that has not increased,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
or increased not so much,

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
how do we do it?

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
We told him that this gratitude is great,

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
go back and remember to say thank you,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
this is the first control group,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
the experiment group is grateful,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
then you have to remember to say thank you,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
in order for you to achieve this goal,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
we ask you to help you do a

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
gratitude plan,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
but this plan is to fill in the

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
following blank,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
when if anything happens,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
then you write

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
how you want to express gratitude,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I'll give you an example,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
for example,

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
when he helped me buy breakfast in the morning,

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
then I want to give him a

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
kiss to express my gratitude,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I wrote it like this,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
this plan is done,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
then we look at this

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
one-line plan,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
four weeks after going home,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
is there a four-week effect?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It sounds quite incredible,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
for some people,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
it may sound a bit incredible,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
it's like writing a fill-in-the-blank,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
and you have to influence how long

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
they spend together a day,

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
they don't spend time together,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
just follow the plan,

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
how much can it affect,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I'll give you an example,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
this method of manipulation

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
is called Implementation Intention,

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
in the document,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
it is found to be a very simple

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
but very surprising effective

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
way to change behavior,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
for example,

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
in this study,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
we divided the subject into two groups,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
one group gave them

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
a reminder,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
it is very important to check the

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
uterus,

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
their subject is a 55-year-old

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
or a few years older woman,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
British,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
remind them that the uterus is very important,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
then you have to participate in the

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
test,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
if you want to make an appointment,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
there is a phone number below,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
remind him,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
then you have to make a plan,

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
for example,

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
someone will write,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
if it is lunch time,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
then I have to call my doctor,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
then make an appointment,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
please help them

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
have an appointment

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
plan,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
we are exactly the same,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
the result found

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
reminder group,

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
then participate in

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
the appointment,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
then participate in the appointment,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
did not miss their

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
appointment ratio,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
about 70%, 69%

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
on the left,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
but only this one-line plan,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
you can add the

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
attendance rate

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
to almost 100,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
in fact, 92,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
but this one-line plan

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
is very effective,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
you can try in life,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I have tried very effective,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
it does not matter to us now,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
the point is that it is effective,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
it is also effective in our experiment,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
one-line plan effectively

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
improved the group of

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
participants in the

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
experiment after the

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
ratio of gratitude,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
but this is a manipulation check,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
because we want to know

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
whether the time together

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
has not changed,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
of course, you can imagine

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
that there is,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
of course, it is from the front to the back,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
the experiment group increased

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
every day,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
the average amount of time

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
together every day,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
then the unit is a minute,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
so it is nearly 80 minutes,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
an hour and 20 minutes,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
then the gray is the error bar,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
then the red is the

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
control group,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
then the control group is basically

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
the front to the back,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
there is no change,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
there is no change in their time together,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
this is not surprising,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
but one-line plan

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
can increase

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
the average time of

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
physical presence

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
every day for 80 minutes,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
then you can see

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
below,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
of course,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
we have to break down

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
and see what you are doing

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
together,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
then across the board,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
for example,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
they sleep together,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
then together,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
then share the project,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
they are together and do

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
the same thing,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
they are cooperating on some things,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
separate project,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
they are in the same room,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
with each other's physical presence,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
but

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
they are doing their own thing,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
for example, you two

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
work from home together,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
they are in the same room,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
across the board,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
the gratitude group has a noticeable effect.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Finally,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
we have measured

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
a remote communication,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that is, how much time

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
do you spend with your partner?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Remote communication,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
what does it mean?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
This is to compare

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
that they may spend more time together,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
but there is no physical presence,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
they spend time together,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
but there is no physical presence.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Indeed,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
in this aspect,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
the gratitude group

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
not only does not increase,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
but also significantly decreases.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
In other words,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
gratitude has a kind of

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
desire for our audience,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
again, this is a triangle,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
this is an American,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
they will have a physical

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
contact.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Let's go back to the mouse.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
This is very important.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
For this

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
biological research,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
it is more experienced,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
you may know,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
physical contact,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
for example, we touch

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
our partner,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
or our partner touches

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
our body,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
it will produce a series of

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
physiological chemical

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
cascade.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
One of them

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
is a neurotransmitter

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
called oxytocin.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
What is it?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Oxytocin,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
in Chinese,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
oxytocin.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
This oxytocin

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
is found in the mouse,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
it is actually difficult to predict

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
bonding.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Let's look at this mouse.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
These two mice are

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
pre-reborn,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
their characteristics are that

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
after mating,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
they will stay together

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and form an exclusive

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
monogamous bond.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
They are not

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
so similar to humans,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
humans are not so monogamous,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
but you know what I'm talking about.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
But the relatives of primary

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
volts, middle volts,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
are not like this,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
they do not have

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
exclusive bonds,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
they are

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
mating, then you can change partners,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
mating, then you can change partners,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
but their genes are very similar,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
but at least

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
the social bonding

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
is very different.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Then the study found that

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
oxytocin plays a very important

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
role in this.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Indeed,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
by manipulating the primary volts

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
and the middle volts

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
oxytocin receptor,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
we can make these mice

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
operate from

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
exclusive bonds

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
into open relationships.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
We can also make open relationships

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
into exclusive.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Indeed,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
because of this reason,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
we collected the urine of

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
these mammals

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
to measure

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
their oxytocin

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
amount.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
We have this marker inside.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Now back to the previous point,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
why

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
the daily report method,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
if you are in one day,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
randomly find a time to BIP your

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
victim, or you are

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
the last time to sleep

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
to a summary,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
there is a difference,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
because we can imagine

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
if we do today is

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
a general biological experiment,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
many times we will say,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
no, the most accurate draw at the scene,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
so you have to know how high

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
now you have to draw now,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
so if you draw out, you will be very

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
accurate to know

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
the degree of oxytocin now,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
then you can ask

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
the degree of oxytocin now affects

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
the human behavior

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
in this moment.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
But we all know,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I feel oxytocin now,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
then I have bonding,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I may not have the opportunity to express gratitude,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I may have to spend

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
you do not know if I am now

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
you thank me, my oxytocin is about to rush up,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
or two hours later

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
rush up to make me

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
express my gratitude to you at night?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I do not know, because the time was pulled

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
very long,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
so once you study the problem,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
this temporal scope becomes larger,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
you may need to measure the way a little change,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
such as we use urine, because you do not

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
urine inside the oxytocin marker

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
is basically

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
considered to be a certain extent

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
or a long period of time

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
oxytocin level average,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
because the urine

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
to hold for a while in the temporal scope,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
so you high, high, low,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
then after the average, the amount of marker will stay in your

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
urine, so it is a relatively long-term average,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
with us in front of the

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
daily report is similar,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
so when we ask the question now,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
if you spend how much time today,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
we may be this kind of measurement

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
is more

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
fit measurement.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I'm done, I'm done.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
If this is the case,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
we are starting at 8.33 today,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I think we

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
can now open to everyone

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
to discuss about

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
9.50,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
if anyone has a question.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
In addition to the audience

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
today is the content of the speech

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
if there is a question, if the speaker

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
past research or

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
so on, you can ask

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
questions.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
If you want to ask a question, you can speak directly.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I am Felix.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I have a question about oxytocin.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Because I saw a document a while ago

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
that said oxytocin

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
seemed to think in the past

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
that it can predict a relationship

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
directly,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
but that

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
study revealed some documents

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and found that, for example,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
in mice, some oxytocin is very

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
high, it even has some aggressive behavior,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and then in humans,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
it seems to be the attachment

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
that affects the

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
effect of oxytocin.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I don't know if you have any

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
opinions on this.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Have you found that people with high oxytocin

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
don't necessarily spend

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
more time on this?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Let's talk about our research first.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I haven't analyzed the oxytocin data yet,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
so I don't know.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
This is a quick answer.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
In our lab, another study

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
found that oxytocin level

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
has to interact with social

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
contacts to have better

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
predictability.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
We found that

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
if your partner is grateful to you,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
but your

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
expression basically

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
sucks,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
then your oxytocin level is useless.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
If you are not a good

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
partner, what are you playing?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
You are playing something, you know,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
nothing. So there is an

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
interaction. Your partner

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
is a good partner, and your oxytocin

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
is higher, and their bonding

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
will be stronger.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Back to what you just said,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I totally agree with

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
what you just said.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
For those of you who don't know

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
the oxytocin literature

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
or the social regulation function of

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
oxytocin literature, a little background.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
In this,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
a lot of news

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
in the first ten years,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
oxytocin is called

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
love hormone.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
As long as your oxytocin level is high,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
you are world peace.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Everyone is a good friend.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
They gave it a name

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
called love hormone.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But in the past few years,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I feel like everyone is moving

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
in the direction

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
of what Felix just said.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
What kind of behavior

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
will oxytocin cause

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
has a high interaction

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
effect.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Rather than a love hormone,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
it is a social hormone.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
If your oxytocin is high,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
your social sensitivity will be high.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So if you are with a good partner,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
you will have a lot of love.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But if you are with

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
your enemy today,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
you will become very aggressive.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It will be more aggressive than

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
it used to be, because you are now

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
very socially sensitive.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Rather than a love hormone,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
it is a bonding hormone

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
or a social regulation hormone.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I feel like oxytocin

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
is more like this.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
My own attitude is that

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
oxytocin should be like this.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
So I agree with Felix.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Thank you.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Do you have any questions

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
for the audience?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Do you want to ask

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
yourself?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Okay.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
There is a question

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
from the audience.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
If you want to follow

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
the social distancing rule,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
if you want to express

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
gratitude to your family

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
or partner through

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
social media,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
is it useful

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
for bonding?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Or do you have

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
any suggestions

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
for this special period?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Okay.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I don't have data,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
but I think it's useful.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I think it's useful.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
The reason is that

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
you can imitate

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
other people's behavior

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and it will be effective.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
But you don't have to

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
see it face to face.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
You can still see it

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
if you turn on the video.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
This is the first one.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The second one is

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
about gratitude.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
There is a similar study

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
done in our next lab.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It's like this.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
It's like

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
asking a veterinarian

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
to come to the lab

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
and watch a funny YouTube video.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
You've probably seen it.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It's a funny YouTube video.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
At the same time,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
there is an experiment partner

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
watching it with you.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
This is another veterinarian.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
At this time,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
the two people will watch the video

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and laugh, right?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Because it's a funny video.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There are two manipulations.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
This is an experimental group.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
One is

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
the partner

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
laughing with the veterinarian

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
at the time of laughing.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
The other group is laughing

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
when the veterinarian is not laughing.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Then the two people

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
find out that

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
after laughing together,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
there will be a better bonding.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Even though

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
their total laughter volume

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
is not high,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
but there is a

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
countermeasure.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Why am I talking about this?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Because I just talked about this.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
The partner is not actually

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
on the spot.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
He actually used Webcam

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
to laugh.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So there is only one person in that space.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
So it's like social distancing.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
For example,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
your partner is far away.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I don't know about you, but I'm in Taiwan.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Let's say my partner is in New York.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Let's spend some time

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
watching a funny video

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
and laughing together.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I think it will have a good effect

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
on bonding.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
The last one is

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
more abstract.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
even if there is no video,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
there is no

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
visual information.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Studies have found that

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
when we hear some sounds,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
our visual cortex

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
will react.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
It's like we're going to

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
visualize what we hear.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So when you read a novel,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
sometimes it looks like

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
there is a picture, right?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Talking on the phone

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
and laughing together

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
even if you don't see people

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
will theoretically have some effect.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And anyway,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
in the process of

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
self-isolation,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
there are

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
interpersonal relationships,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
no matter what form, far, near,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
visual, no visual, only sound,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
or a card, text, etc.,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
far better than

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
visual.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
That's my prediction.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I believe there are

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
a lot of data to support it.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Our time is up.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
This is the last question.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I don't know if you have any questions.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
If not,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
let me summarize

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and ask you a question.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I've learned a lot

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
from your talk today.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
As someone

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
who cares about marriage,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and we're in self-isolation,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
we're stuck together

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
under the same roof.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I've learned a lot

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
from your talk today.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I've learned a lot

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
from your talk today.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I've learned a lot

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
from your talk today.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Do you have anything

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
to say to people

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
to help them

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
implement

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
self-isolation

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
after the pandemic

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and recovery?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Oh, I see.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I think

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
implementation and intention

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
are quite fun.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
You can try to write it down

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and see what you can do

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
with it.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I think if you can

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
use it to help you

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
pay more attention to

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
the things you should be grateful for

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
in your life,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
it will be very helpful.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Why am I talking about

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the things you should be grateful for

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
in your life,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
instead of the things you should remember to express?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Because

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
research has shown

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
that it is easy to express

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
something that is not sincere.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
But

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
when you are truly grateful,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
you may feel

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
that you are not expressing yourself,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
but others can see it.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
So for me,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
it's about being grateful,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
not expressing it.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Implementation and intention

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
is a very effective

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
method that I think

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
can help you achieve this goal.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So you can write it down.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
For example,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
if he helps me buy breakfast this morning,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I will

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
say thank you

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
instead of

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
remembering to say thank you.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I will cherish this breakfast

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
that he bought for me.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
But today,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
if he helps me buy breakfast every day,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I will cherish it.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Next,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
my assumption is that

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I will express my gratitude

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
smoothly,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
so I don't need to say it again.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
But the emotion part is quite important.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Okay, I'm done.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Okay, time control is very good

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and very practical.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Thank you Dr. Zhang Yanping for

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
joining us today.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I hope that everyone

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
has a wonderful and healthy day

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
whether it's day or night.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Thank you for your participation today.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Thank you Dr. Zhang Yanping.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Thank you.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Okay, the recording should end here.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Okay.
