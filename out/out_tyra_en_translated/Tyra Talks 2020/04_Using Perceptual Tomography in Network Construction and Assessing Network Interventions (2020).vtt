00:00.000 --> 00:29.980
OK, thank you all for participating in our speech today, I am the host today, Zhang Yanping, I represent everyone with a warm applause to welcome our speaker today, Li Xuanwei teacher, Li Xuanwei teacher, OK, are you shooting yourself?

00:29.980 --> 00:58.960
OK, before I introduce Mr. Xuanwei, let me tell you about some of the events of today's housekeeping, because later when the speaker is speaking, his screen will be a projection of his own projection, so he may not be able to see the dialogue window, if you have any questions, if you want to stick to the dialogue window, if you do not know what the dialogue window is,

00:58.960 --> 01:25.960
now everyone on the right hand side of the BlueJeans may be able to see a row of the audience, and then the second option chat can type, basically a chat window, if you have any questions, you can stick there, but because the speaker will not see, because he is looking at the powerpoint, so if you leave a message, it does not matter, everyone will leave, and then I will find a place to ask questions in time,

01:25.960 --> 01:52.960
either to ask for everyone's behalf, or you can ask yourself, but just stay there, and then I will help the speaker to see, and then I will listen to the speaker today, this time is about 40 to 45 minutes, he will talk so much content, and then there will be 15 to 30 minutes of Q&A time in the back.

01:52.960 --> 02:22.920
OK, so these are housekeeping, and then let me introduce today's speaker, I just said that Mr. Xuan Wei, he is called Li Xuan Wei, today's speaker is called Li Xuan Wei, and then his university is in the Taiwan University Department of State, and then he went to Zhengda Yingshu to read the master's degree, and then after reading the master's degree, his doctorate is in UNC,

02:23.920 --> 02:34.920
the Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina, and then the specialized topic is Complex Network, and the topic of Social Network.

02:35.920 --> 02:49.920
OK, after completing his doctorate in 2016, he went to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to do postdoc, and did it until 2018. Oh, by the way, if I say something wrong, you can correct me directly.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.920
No, this is all public information.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
OK, thank you.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.920
I actually saw it on your website.

02:56.920 --> 03:19.920
OK, and then after finishing the postdoc, in 2019, he returned to Taiwan and started his career as an assistant professor and assistant researcher at NTU Politics, NTU Society, and NTU Central Academy of Sciences until now.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.920
Your position should be in NTU Central Academy of Sciences, right?

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
Yes.

03:26.920 --> 03:34.920
In NTU Central Academy of Sciences, however, there are also students and teachers, and often come and go, on both sides.

03:34.920 --> 03:42.920
In NTU Central Academy of Sciences, Wayne is in the Society, and part of NTU is NTU Politics and Social Peace.

03:42.920 --> 03:51.920
OK, this is the background of today's speaker.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.920
A fun fact is that Wayne likes to eat strawberry cake.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.920
You have to laugh out loud.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.920
That's right, I can testify.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.920
Didn't you get muted?

04:09.920 --> 04:12.920
Actually, this is what we are talking about.

04:12.920 --> 04:18.920
I don't know if he really likes to eat strawberry cake, but if you buy him a strawberry cake, he will be very happy.

04:18.920 --> 04:25.920
OK, let's leave today's event to Wayne.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.920
Let him introduce the topic to everyone.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.920
Let me clap on behalf of everyone again.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.920
OK, thank you Wayne for the introduction.

04:36.920 --> 04:42.920
I am very happy to be able to come to Terra today to share some of the research I did before.

04:42.920 --> 04:50.920
It is also a fun fact that Wayne invited me to give a speech about two or three months ago.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.920
I have heard of Terra before, and now I am very happy to have the opportunity to give a speech here.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.920
It is quite related to Wayne.

04:59.920 --> 05:06.920
We all graduated from UNC Chapel Hill, and we are still colleagues at the Central Academy of Sciences.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.920
We also wrote an article together.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.920
I don't know where the article will be posted.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.920
But I think the world is very small.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.920
We have been in UNC Chapel Hill for three or four years.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.920
I didn't expect to come back to Taiwan and still be in the same place, which is the upper and lower floors.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.920
I can still write articles now.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.920
So things are hard to predict.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.920
There are also many cross-field collaborations now.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.920
Maybe I will share my research here.

05:33.920 --> 05:39.920
Maybe everyone here has a degree or is studying for a degree.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.920
Maybe you are interested after seeing it.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.920
Maybe we can also start some cross-field cooperation in the future.

05:46.920 --> 05:52.920
The time I want to share today is about 45 minutes.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.920
It may be about 11 o'clock in Taiwan time.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.920
I will stay for about 15 to 30 minutes to discuss with you.

06:00.920 --> 06:04.920
If you have any questions, you can come here to discuss.

06:04.920 --> 06:11.920
Although I see 56 pages here, I should say that many of my videos are relatively fast.

06:12.920 --> 06:17.920
Because this is a compilation of two articles.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.920
What I want to share today is within two articles.

06:20.920 --> 06:25.920
So if you are interested, you can go directly to see the two articles.

06:25.920 --> 06:33.920
Whether it is model setting or mathematical inference, I only introduce the concept of these articles to everyone.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.920
If you are interested, you can find articles to read directly.

06:36.920 --> 06:43.920
You are welcome to ask questions, discuss, or write to me after reading the article.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.920
I am looking forward to interacting with everyone.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.920
Okay, let me start by introducing the title of this article.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.920
The title of this article is ...

06:52.920 --> 06:56.920
I have just been responded by two friends that my title is too long and I do not understand.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.920
So I will slowly talk about what this title means.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.920
Using Perceptual Tomography

07:01.920 --> 07:04.920
We want to use something called Perceptual Tomography.

07:04.920 --> 07:09.920
Perceptual is a perceptual thing.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.920
Tomography is a segmented scan.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.920
We will see later why we use the term Tomography.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.920
Of course, we are not really using segmented scanning to do social science research.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.920
We use this Perceptual Tomography to define later.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.920
We want to build a network.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.920
It is a subjective network.

07:28.920 --> 07:35.920
It is not a traditional social network built by the majority of people.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.920
It is a third-party recognition.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.920
What should this group look like?

07:40.920 --> 07:42.920
We ask other people.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.920
We ask some people on the Internet.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.920
Do you think that A and B are related?

07:47.920 --> 07:52.920
If A and B are related, are they close or do not know or are not familiar?

07:52.920 --> 07:57.920
Use this third-party recognition to restore a network.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.920
It is the same as a general social network.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.920
I am talking about the Internet and the Internet.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.920
Sociologists like to talk about the Internet.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.920
Maybe other field scientists like to talk about the Internet.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.920
But it is the same.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.920
We use this third-party recognition to restore a network.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.920
We can try to compare this network in the future.

08:15.920 --> 08:23.920
The way to restore the Internet is different from the traditional social network that everyone likes to use.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.920
The second part is that we want to see if we are in a network environment.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.920
Do some intervention in the network environment.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.920
This intervention may be some policy promulgation.

08:35.920 --> 08:41.920
Or what we are talking about here is a policy promulgation that promotes public health.

08:41.920 --> 08:46.920
We want to measure how effective this intervention is.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.920
Can we use quantification to see how effective it is?

08:50.920 --> 08:57.920
It is in a social network environment.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.920
We can only find some people to participate in this intervention.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.920
It's like giving them some public health education.

09:04.920 --> 09:10.920
But we want to know if these interventions have spread out.

09:10.920 --> 09:17.920
We want to see how effective it is in a community level network.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.920
Can we quantify it?

09:19.920 --> 09:22.920
So this is probably the meaning of this topic.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.920
Then I will continue to go down.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.920
This is the outline of today's speech.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.920
I still divide it into three parts.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.920
The first part is because I received a letter.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.920
I want to know that this may have nothing to do with the speech.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.920
He wants to know why I went from mathematics to sociology.

09:39.920 --> 09:45.920
So I will spend about five minutes to talk about what I am doing during my doctorate.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.920
I originally studied mathematics as introduced by Yanping.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.920
Then I turned to sociology.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.920
I want to talk about the turning point in the middle.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.920
So it will take about five to ten minutes.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.920
The remaining two parts are the introduction of two articles.

10:02.920 --> 10:07.920
The first part is how to go from mathematics to social science.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.920
So I want to talk about two concepts in this part.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.920
The first is social dynamics modeling.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.920
This is social dynamics.

10:15.920 --> 10:20.920
How do we use modelization or form logic to study this matter?

10:20.920 --> 10:25.920
We know that in the real world, there are actually a lot of interactions with people.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.920
Then it is very complicated, but it may be a lot of faces.

10:28.920 --> 10:35.920
Of course, there are ways to study this thing in various fields.

10:35.920 --> 10:40.920
Then we look at it from the perspective of mathematics and physics.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.920
It is a very, very high-dimensional complex system.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.920
Because it interacts too much and has a lot of impact.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.920
Then the things you want to test can be infinite.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.920
You can find things to test.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.920
What should we do? How do we deal with this kind of thing?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.920
We will try to model it.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.920
The way to model is to do some simple simplifications.

10:58.920 --> 11:02.920
You have to look at the most important thing in this system.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.920
What are the driving forces that you care about?

11:06.920 --> 11:08.920
We have to find it out.

11:08.920 --> 11:14.920
The way we do it is to think of it as an atom.

11:14.920 --> 11:21.920
Economists may be called agents or social scientists may be called agents.

11:21.920 --> 11:29.920
We use this very simple simplification to think of it as some examples with the same characteristics or agents.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.920
Then look at the interaction between these examples and agents.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.920
At the same time, we also simplify a lot of things they can do.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.920
For example, if it is an example, it may be left-handed or right-handed.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.920
If it is an agent, it may be happy or unhappy.

11:44.920 --> 11:48.920
This is a very simple two-point method, or it may be a lot of cutting.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.920
We cut these examples.

11:52.920 --> 11:58.920
If we present it in a complex system or on the Internet, it is a point.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
We call nodes.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.920
These nodes will have a state.

12:02.920 --> 12:06.920
As I said, it may be a binary, or it may be a multi-state.

12:06.920 --> 12:12.920
It may be that you are in a very bad mood today, and it is very good.

12:12.920 --> 12:20.920
This kind of multi-state, or it may be continuous, may be a continuous change, may be a healthy state, may be a healthy state.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.920
Of course, it can also be multi-dimensional.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.920
It depends on what you are interested in.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.920
The other part we value is the structure of this system.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.920
What kind of relationship do these people have with each other?

12:34.920 --> 12:40.920
You can think of it as a social relationship, such as a family or a workplace.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.920
You can also think of it as geographical.

12:42.920 --> 12:46.920
It may be that if the distance between people is very close, there may be a risk of infectious diseases.

12:46.920 --> 12:52.920
We have to look at these modes, these social networks, and the structure behind them.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.920
How will it affect each of us in the above example or people?

12:56.920 --> 13:00.920
Of course, I listed some of the ways to form this structure.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.920
Systematic is that it has a system.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.920
What we understand here is that it is determined.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.920
It's like a person.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.920
You may know that the grid has four neighbors.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.920
It's like a barbecue net.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.920
One person has about four neighbors.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.920
This may be a systematic network.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.920
Or random.

13:20.920 --> 13:26.920
You may have heard of a very simple random network model.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.920
In the system, any two people have a certain probability of being linked together.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.920
Or heterogeneous.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.920
It may be heterogeneous.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.920
Every point has a different way of being linked together.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.920
Or it can also change over time.

13:38.920 --> 13:44.920
We can study the dynamic system or time series of this system that changes over time.

13:44.920 --> 13:52.920
Our new method is to build a simplified model in this complex system.

13:52.920 --> 13:58.920
But this simplified model has to be able to capture one or two key things that we are most interested in.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.920
As Einstein said, a model should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.920
We have to simplify it to the point where we can no longer simplify it.

14:06.920 --> 14:14.920
The tool I use is the network theory in the complex system.

14:14.920 --> 14:20.920
Network theory is a method of expression.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.920
It is also a method of learning.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.920
It is different from the previous research.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.920
It is an interaction phenomenon that attaches more importance to the medium-length.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.920
What is medium-length?

14:30.920 --> 14:34.920
It is a length between micro and macro.

14:34.920 --> 14:42.920
At the macro level, you can see all people as being able to interact with others.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.920
For example, in a group, we see that everyone is the same.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.920
Let's say we have a class of students.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.920
Then we have to study how COVID-19 spreads in this place.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.920
Then we say that every student is the same.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.920
And they can interact with other students at will.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.920
This may be seen as a large group.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.920
This is the macro level.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.920
What about micro?

15:10.920 --> 15:14.920
Micro is another part of the macro.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.920
It just sees everyone differently.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.920
You have to emphasize that its personal characteristics are like its height, age and weight.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.920
It may be different for everyone.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.920
What we do at the network level is not this thing.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.920
At the network level, we assume that everyone is the same.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.920
Unless you want to eat different types of points.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.920
Of course, that can also be extended.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.920
But our basic assumption is that everyone is the same.

15:34.920 --> 15:38.920
What we care about is the structure of this system.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.920
Who has a connection with whom?

15:40.920 --> 15:42.920
Who will influence each other?

15:42.920 --> 15:44.920
Or who will get the message from which side?

15:44.920 --> 15:50.920
So what we see is that the network is a medium-length research method.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.920
It is between large and small.

15:52.920 --> 15:56.920
The subject of my research is social networks.

15:56.920 --> 16:00.920
Of course, there are different kinds of social networks.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.920
Of course, there may be a lot of networks.

16:02.920 --> 16:10.920
In the natural world, there may be biological networks, food chains, bacterial networks, or virus networks.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.920
It may also be artificial, such as computer networks.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
Topology is how computers and birds are grouped together.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.920
Or triple-W network.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.920
Or some traffic networks.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.920
In fact, there are many layers of network composition.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.920
The main type of research I do is social networks.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.920
What is the difference between social networks and other networks?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.920
Here I have listed three.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.920
The first is that it has a phenomenon called homophily.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.920
Homophily is translated into Chinese as homogeneity.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.920
You like people with the same characteristics as you.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.920
You have this tendency.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.920
You are also in a relationship with a person.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.920
You would like to say that you are in a relationship with a similar person.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.920
So it is a tree of spines.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.920
Or birds of a feather flock together.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.920
This is the first phenomenon.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.920
This may not be as common as other networks.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.920
The second is high clustering.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.920
What is the meaning of high clustering?

16:52.920 --> 16:54.920
It is the ability to create or store data.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.920
It can be classified as a network or a network.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.920
It can be classified as a network or a network.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.920
It can be classified as a network or a network.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.920
The second is high clustering.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.920
The second is high clustering.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.920
Watch out for'homoplasticity'.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.920
Watch out for'homoplasticity'.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.920
It means that there may be many Gabrielian stars on the network.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.920
It means that there may be many Gabrielian stars on the network.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.920
What is small triangle?

17:15.920 --> 17:17.920
Devil's friends.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.920
It may be that you know B.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.920
B knows C.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
If the two are in a strong relationship,

17:23.920 --> 17:25.920
If the two are in a strong relationship,

17:25.920 --> 17:27.920
Usually there will be a relationship that is at least an identity of 3 to 4.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.920
Usually there will be a relationship that is at least an identity of 3 to 4.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.920
Therefore, in general social networks,

17:31.920 --> 17:33.920
Therefore, in general social networks,

17:33.920 --> 17:35.920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.920
abc is very rich in the network ratio.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.920
You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.920
You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.920
You can compare it with other networks of the public safe outside the movie.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.920
There are many such small triangles.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.920
There are many such small triangles.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.920
Third, small world.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.920
Most of people may have heard of the principle of 6-degree approximation.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.920
Most of people may have heard of the principle of 6-degree approximation.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.920
But in a system or in the world,

17:59.920 --> 18:01.920
But in a system or in the world,

18:01.920 --> 18:03.920
The distance between people may not be as far as you imagined.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.920
The distance between people may not be as far as you imagined.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.920
How?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.920
How?

18:09.920 --> 18:12.000
Influencers,

18:12.000 --> 18:12.920
they come about 5 phase and 6 phase.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.920
they come about 5 phase and 6 phase.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.920
Although they may not be aware of the shortest way,

18:16.920 --> 18:18.920
Although they may not be aware of the shortest way,

18:18.920 --> 18:20.920
you can see the sky when you open your eyes.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.920
you can see the sky when you open your eyes.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.920
You and a person in Africa,

18:24.920 --> 18:25.920
the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.920
the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.920
the distance doesn't exceed 20 steps.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.920
So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.920
So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.920
So there are many shortcuts and quick ways in the system.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.920
And that's why the world is much smaller than we thought.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.920
And that's why the world is much smaller than we thought.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.920
By small scale, I mean that your road is less long than you imagined.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.920
By small scale, I mean that your road is less long than you imagined.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.920
The way we talk here is the shortest way.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.920
There are many shortcuts in the system.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.920
Make it very easy to get close to the goal.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.920
Make it very easy to get close to the goal.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.920
And then we can see the state of the point.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.920
Let's take a simple example.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.920
Let's take a simple example.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.920
You may see that your neighbor or friend

19:58.920 --> 20:00.920
You may see that your neighbor or friend

20:00.920 --> 20:02.920
has a high infectious disease.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.920
has a high infectious disease.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.920
People around him may need to stay away from him.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.920
People around him may need to stay away from him.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.920
You need to have social distancing.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.920
You need to have social distancing.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.920
Or you let him be isolated.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
If he is sick today,

20:16.920 --> 20:18.920
If he is sick today,

20:18.920 --> 20:20.920
this limit to his surroundings.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.920
This limit to his surroundings.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.920
the overlapping network will be significantly changing.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.920
the overlapping network will be significantly changing.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.920
Because of the isolation,

20:28.920 --> 20:30.920
for the time being, he has lost many connections.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.920
His friends may have lost connections with his friend.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.920
His friends may have lost connections with his friend.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.920
His friends may find others to replace.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.920
Or he has more resources and more time for socializing.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
Or he has more resources and more time for socializing.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
So when a person loses something,

20:42.920 --> 20:44.920
Or when a person loses something,

20:44.920 --> 20:46.920
he is isolated,

23:46.920 --> 23:48.920
But in society,

23:48.920 --> 23:50.920
But in society,

23:50.920 --> 23:52.920
there are many real-life information.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.920
But we need to reverse the model.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.920
But we need to reverse the model.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.920
What is it?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.920
What is it?

24:00.920 --> 24:02.920
I don't know if it's a problem with engineering.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.920
reverse engineering

24:04.920 --> 24:06.920
or inverse problem

24:06.920 --> 24:08.920
How can we measure

24:08.920 --> 24:10.920
We want to know

24:10.920 --> 24:12.920
how can we measure

24:12.920 --> 24:14.920
So I'm going back to my model

24:14.920 --> 24:16.920
I think the process is interesting

24:16.920 --> 24:18.920
good

24:18.920 --> 24:19.920
The first one I want to talk about is

24:19.920 --> 24:20.920
indians

24:20.920 --> 24:21.920
perceptual tomography

24:21.920 --> 24:24.920
both of them

24:24.920 --> 24:25.920
He is in the research

24:25.920 --> 24:28.920
Irish

24:28.920 --> 24:29.920
aboriginal

24:29.920 --> 24:31.920
He is looking for some

24:31.920 --> 24:32.920
fishing village

24:32.920 --> 24:33.920
some

24:33.920 --> 24:34.920
small villages

24:34.920 --> 24:36.920
That place

24:36.920 --> 24:37.920
is Arab

24:37.920 --> 24:38.920
them

24:38.920 --> 24:39.920
That place is

24:39.920 --> 24:40.920
next to the extreme

24:40.920 --> 24:42.920
That is their Så

24:42.920 --> 24:43.920
Is long in summer

24:43.920 --> 24:44.920
Very short in winter

24:44.920 --> 24:45.920
Maybe one or two months

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
Can't see the sun

24:47.920 --> 24:48.920
That

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
Our team

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
I did not go

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
But we have some

24:51.920 --> 24:52.920
Humanists

24:52.920 --> 24:53.920
Squatting there

24:53.920 --> 24:54.920
They are there

24:54.920 --> 24:55.920
Visit these American aborigines

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
Looking at their social network

24:57.920 --> 24:58.920
Just ask

24:58.920 --> 24:59.920
Who are you familiar with

24:59.920 --> 25:00.920
Then who is familiar with who

25:00.920 --> 25:01.920
That

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
And some of them

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
Psychological research

25:03.920 --> 25:04.920
because

25:04.920 --> 25:05.920
We know that

25:05.920 --> 25:07.920
People near the extreme

25:07.920 --> 25:09.920
Their alcoholism rate is high

25:09.920 --> 25:10.920
Then their

25:10.920 --> 25:12.920
The suicide rate of adult males is high

25:12.920 --> 25:13.920
So we want to see

25:13.920 --> 25:14.920
These

25:14.920 --> 25:16.920
Some negative features

25:16.920 --> 25:18.920
Or healthy behavior

25:18.920 --> 25:19.920
He will

25:19.920 --> 25:21.920
Will it be affected by his social network

25:21.920 --> 25:22.920
Or will he turn around

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
To affect his social network

25:24.920 --> 25:26.920
So we are from

25:26.920 --> 25:28.920
Humanists squatting to get information

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
To build a social network

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
Then look again

25:30.920 --> 25:31.920
It's them

25:31.920 --> 25:32.920
The health behavior of these people

25:32.920 --> 25:33.920
Or some other behaviors

25:33.920 --> 25:35.920
Like these people

25:35.920 --> 25:36.920
Is there any resource

25:36.920 --> 25:37.920
Willing to help others

25:37.920 --> 25:38.920
Or

25:38.920 --> 25:40.920
Willing to provide other people with knowledge

25:40.920 --> 25:41.920
We look at it from the perspective of social networks

25:41.920 --> 25:42.920
Look at the behavior of these people

25:42.920 --> 25:43.920
it is good

25:43.920 --> 25:45.920
The first thing to do

25:45.920 --> 25:46.920
It's us

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
Of course it is

25:47.920 --> 25:48.920
Get these people's network

25:48.920 --> 25:49.920
We just ask

25:49.920 --> 25:50.920
Who are you friends with

25:50.920 --> 25:52.920
How familiar are you with him

25:52.920 --> 25:54.920
Then this is usually

25:54.920 --> 25:56.920
It's the way sociologists do it

25:56.920 --> 25:57.920
In fact, social networks

25:57.920 --> 25:59.920
From the perspective of sociologists

25:59.920 --> 26:00.920
They started doing it very early

26:00.920 --> 26:02.920
Started doing it in the 1930s

26:02.920 --> 26:04.920
They will draw a social graph

26:04.920 --> 26:05.920
They asked a person

26:05.920 --> 26:06.920
Who are you familiar with

26:06.920 --> 26:07.920
Who is not familiar with

26:07.920 --> 26:08.920
That

26:08.920 --> 26:09.920
Of course we did this part

26:09.920 --> 26:10.920
The other way we did

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
Is we want

26:11.920 --> 26:13.920
Look at it by sampling

26:13.920 --> 26:14.920
Can I just draw

26:14.920 --> 26:16.920
In this village

26:16.920 --> 26:18.920
Maybe a part of the hundreds of people

26:18.920 --> 26:19.920
Maybe 5%

26:19.920 --> 26:20.920
Maybe 10%

26:20.920 --> 26:21.920
Or 30%

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
If we only draw a part of the people

26:22.920 --> 26:23.920
Then we ask him

26:23.920 --> 26:24.920
Hey, you think

26:24.920 --> 26:26.920
Who is familiar with whom in this network

26:26.920 --> 26:29.920
Can we restore the entire network

26:29.920 --> 26:30.920
I don't ask everyone

26:30.920 --> 26:31.920
Who is he familiar with

26:31.920 --> 26:33.920
And just do sampling

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
If you draw a sample

26:34.920 --> 26:36.920
Can you restore the entire network

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
But this may not be the same

26:37.920 --> 26:39.920
Because if you draw a sample

26:39.920 --> 26:40.920
You may find people

26:40.920 --> 26:41.920
He is to guess

26:41.920 --> 26:43.920
Other people's networks

26:43.920 --> 26:44.920
He is

26:44.920 --> 26:46.920
He is a subjective recognition

26:46.920 --> 26:47.920
Other people's

26:47.920 --> 26:49.920
Exchange status or relationship status

26:49.920 --> 26:50.920
Then we want to compare

26:50.920 --> 26:52.920
Is the difference between these two networks

26:52.920 --> 26:53.920
One is your subjective

26:53.920 --> 26:55.920
Your own report

26:55.920 --> 26:57.920
For example, I am with A or B

26:57.920 --> 26:58.920
I am with these two people

26:58.920 --> 26:59.920
Who is a friend

26:59.920 --> 27:00.920
Who is not a friend

27:00.920 --> 27:01.920
Another angle is

27:01.920 --> 27:03.920
The angle we use here is

27:03.920 --> 27:05.920
I went to see

27:05.920 --> 27:06.920
The first three people

27:06.920 --> 27:08.920
Then I went to see if they had a relationship

27:08.920 --> 27:09.920
If there is a relationship

27:09.920 --> 27:10.920
I report

27:10.920 --> 27:11.920
If it doesn't matter

27:11.920 --> 27:13.920
I also said they had nothing to do with it

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
So what we rely on is

27:14.920 --> 27:15.920
Third party report

27:15.920 --> 27:17.920
That third party report

27:17.920 --> 27:18.920
He can tell us

27:18.920 --> 27:20.920
Okay, these people are related

27:20.920 --> 27:21.920
Or these people have nothing to do with it

27:21.920 --> 27:22.920
He may be

27:22.920 --> 27:24.920
Presence or absence of individual properties

27:24.920 --> 27:26.920
And pairwise relationships

27:26.920 --> 27:27.920
So he can tell us

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
These people are related or not

27:29.920 --> 27:30.920
That

27:30.920 --> 27:32.920
According to this third party report

27:32.920 --> 27:35.920
We can build a network with direction

27:35.920 --> 27:37.920
There are positive and negative networks

27:38.920 --> 27:41.920
The positive network is the general social network

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
He is

27:42.920 --> 27:43.920
Two have a relationship

27:43.920 --> 27:45.920
Give him a positive connection

27:45.920 --> 27:47.920
If it is a negative network

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
The two should have nothing to do with it

27:49.920 --> 27:51.920
We'll give him a negative connection

27:51.920 --> 27:53.920
And this negative connection is that we believe

27:53.920 --> 27:54.920
These two people

27:54.920 --> 27:55.920
From the perspective of the third party report

27:55.920 --> 27:57.920
They should be relatively unrelated

27:57.920 --> 27:58.920
So we call it robust

27:58.920 --> 28:00.920
They don't have that

28:00.920 --> 28:02.920
Connection

28:02.920 --> 28:05.920
Okay, so this is how we do it

28:05.920 --> 28:07.920
It's actually like I just said

28:07.920 --> 28:08.920
We're on a network

28:08.920 --> 28:10.920
We want to do sampling

28:10.920 --> 28:12.920
Of course, there are many ways to do it

28:12.920 --> 28:13.920
I have a few here

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
Like Respondent-Driven Sampling

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
Snowball Sampling

28:15.920 --> 28:16.920
Or Convenient Sampling

28:16.920 --> 28:17.920
Or Web-based Sampling

28:17.920 --> 28:19.920
It's all a way of sampling

28:19.920 --> 28:21.920
So our way of sampling is

28:21.920 --> 28:22.920
We are

28:22.920 --> 28:24.920
Uh, invite people to participate in the study

28:24.920 --> 28:26.920
We're a little bit like a convenient sample

28:26.920 --> 28:27.920
And then let these people come

28:27.920 --> 28:30.920
Provide them with their knowledge

28:30.920 --> 28:31.920
Of course

28:31.920 --> 28:33.920
Of course there will be some

28:33.920 --> 28:36.920
Problems with, uh, we're going to deal with

28:36.920 --> 28:38.920
The first one is us

28:38.920 --> 28:40.920
Uh, it could be incomplete data

28:40.920 --> 28:41.920
It's just that he might

28:41.920 --> 28:43.920
Uh, this guy, he's coming to us

28:43.920 --> 28:45.920
Say he recognizes the social network

28:45.920 --> 28:47.920
Maybe there is

28:47.920 --> 28:48.920
There may be insufficient information

28:48.920 --> 28:50.920
This person doesn't know

28:50.920 --> 28:52.920
Uh, I, we asked him

28:52.920 --> 28:53.920
Does D have anything to do with E?

28:53.920 --> 28:55.920
He may not be familiar with D and E

28:55.920 --> 28:56.920
He may not know

28:56.920 --> 28:58.920
Does D have anything to do with E?

28:58.920 --> 29:00.920
Or he may report errors

29:00.920 --> 29:01.920
Is that maybe

29:01.920 --> 29:03.920
D and E have nothing to do with it

29:03.920 --> 29:05.920
And then from the third party's point of view

29:05.920 --> 29:06.920
He may be related

29:06.920 --> 29:08.920
Or he may be tired

29:08.920 --> 29:10.920
He may have done too many of these questions

29:10.920 --> 29:11.920
Then his quality of information

29:11.920 --> 29:13.920
Or the concentration dropped

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
He might give us some wrong information

29:15.920 --> 29:17.920
The other one we face

29:17.920 --> 29:19.920
The main risk is

29:19.920 --> 29:21.920
Everyone's perception may be much worse

29:21.920 --> 29:23.920
So this kind of information may be

29:23.920 --> 29:24.920
There is a lot of this variability

29:24.920 --> 29:26.920
Then we have to deal with these problems

29:26.920 --> 29:28.920
Okay, so what we're going to do is

29:28.920 --> 29:30.920
Why are we called

29:30.920 --> 29:31.920
Perceptual Tomography

29:31.920 --> 29:33.920
Tomography is a segmented scan

29:33.920 --> 29:34.920
Is that you see a object

29:34.920 --> 29:36.920
Then you can go from different angles

29:36.920 --> 29:37.920
To do projection on it

29:37.920 --> 29:39.920
Then what you see may be different

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
So you see this object in the middle

29:41.920 --> 29:43.920
It has four entities

29:43.920 --> 29:46.920
Then you cut from the angle of S1 and S2

29:46.920 --> 29:48.920
It has two different pictures

29:48.920 --> 29:50.920
Then look at it from the angle of P

29:50.920 --> 29:51.920
It also has different pictures

29:51.920 --> 29:52.920
What we want to say

29:52.920 --> 29:54.920
What we want to say is

29:54.920 --> 29:55.920
In our hearts

29:55.920 --> 29:57.920
Uh, we might be in this system

29:57.920 --> 29:59.920
There is a possible

29:59.920 --> 30:01.920
Real social network

30:01.920 --> 30:03.920
A and B are related

30:03.920 --> 30:04.920
B and C are familiar

30:04.920 --> 30:06.920
Then A and C do not know

30:06.920 --> 30:08.920
This kind of real social network is this

30:08.920 --> 30:09.920
We see these four objects

30:09.920 --> 30:11.920
It is real

30:11.920 --> 30:12.920
but

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
No one knows

30:13.920 --> 30:14.920
What does this real network look like

30:14.920 --> 30:16.920
It's a bit like blind imaging

30:16.920 --> 30:18.920
You just look at it from a certain angle

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
What you see is what you imagine

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
So what we're going to do is

30:22.920 --> 30:24.920
Find a lot of people to see this thing

30:24.920 --> 30:25.920
See what this social network looks like

30:25.920 --> 30:27.920
Look at it from different social positions

30:27.920 --> 30:29.920
Or look at it from different angles of the Internet

30:29.920 --> 30:30.920
What does this object look like

30:30.920 --> 30:32.920
Then look at it

30:32.920 --> 30:34.920
Can we finally restore

30:34.920 --> 30:36.920
The social network in everyone's mind

30:36.920 --> 30:37.920
But this social network

30:37.920 --> 30:38.920
It may be with

30:38.920 --> 30:40.920
Uh, the real social network is not very similar

30:40.920 --> 30:41.920
One is subjective construction

30:41.920 --> 30:43.920
One is a collective subjective construction

30:43.920 --> 30:44.920
This is our current way

30:44.920 --> 30:46.920
He is one

30:46.920 --> 30:48.920
Uh, a more subjective objective report

30:48.920 --> 30:50.920
Because this is my own subjective

30:50.920 --> 30:52.920
Okay, I'm with A

30:52.920 --> 30:54.920
With A, with C, with D

30:54.920 --> 30:56.920
This kind of subjective objective report

30:56.920 --> 30:58.920
Then we want to compare these two ways

30:58.920 --> 31:00.920
What's the difference in the network that was built

31:00.920 --> 31:06.920
Okay, so we're going to, uh, find these, uh, in Alaska

31:06.920 --> 31:09.920
These people in the village come to participate in our research

31:09.920 --> 31:12.920
Then, uh, everyone comes to invite us

31:12.920 --> 31:14.920
Uh, we were invited by us

31:14.920 --> 31:16.920
He will go and see the photos of other people

31:16.920 --> 31:19.920
Let's say there are about 400 people in this village

31:19.920 --> 31:22.920
Then we will show him about 40 photos

31:22.920 --> 31:24.920
Is a person to say

31:24.920 --> 31:25.920
Do you know these 40 people

31:25.920 --> 31:27.920
Can you call his name

31:27.920 --> 31:30.920
Do you know the relationship between these 40 people

31:30.920 --> 31:33.920
If you say these people don't know these 40 people

31:33.920 --> 31:35.920
He might not judge

31:35.920 --> 31:37.920
The social status of these people

31:37.920 --> 31:38.920
If you know

31:38.920 --> 31:40.920
Let's see how we should go

31:40.920 --> 31:43.920
Sort out some of these people's social networks

31:43.920 --> 31:45.920
See which people are more, uh, related

31:45.920 --> 31:47.920
Some people are more irrelevant

31:47.920 --> 31:50.920
Okay, so the way we use it

31:50.920 --> 31:52.920
It's the way we use this

31:52.920 --> 31:55.920
It's the way we put these people's photos

31:55.920 --> 31:58.920
We invite the audience to put them in different baskets

31:58.920 --> 32:01.920
What are the conditions in the basket

32:01.920 --> 32:04.920
The condition in the basket is that the audience should think

32:04.920 --> 32:06.920
These people are in the same group

32:06.920 --> 32:08.920
He just put it in the same basket

32:08.920 --> 32:11.920
So, uh, let's say we give him five baskets

32:11.920 --> 32:14.920
We later, uh, said, okay, so you

32:14.920 --> 32:15.920
Of these 40 people

32:15.920 --> 32:17.920
You may know 30 of them

32:17.920 --> 32:19.920
You put people you think are more familiar

32:19.920 --> 32:21.920
Put it in the same basket

32:21.920 --> 32:23.920
If you think it's not familiar

32:23.920 --> 32:26.920
You have to separate these people into different baskets

32:26.920 --> 32:29.920
So this is the main way we use

32:29.920 --> 32:30.920
We give different people

32:30.920 --> 32:32.920
Is to look at different 40 photos

32:32.920 --> 32:34.920
And then ask them to put them in different baskets

32:34.920 --> 32:37.920
Okay, so, uh, what are our advantages

32:37.920 --> 32:39.920
The advantage is that this method is very fast

32:39.920 --> 32:41.920
Is that we show them

32:41.920 --> 32:42.920
A small part of the group

32:42.920 --> 32:44.920
Maybe 40 photos out of 400 people

32:44.920 --> 32:46.920
Then we don't have to let him judge

32:46.920 --> 32:47.920
Two out of 400 people

32:47.920 --> 32:48.920
Because that judgment doesn't matter

32:48.920 --> 32:52.920
The function of the human brain processing capacity

32:52.920 --> 32:54.920
Probably not so strong

32:54.920 --> 32:57.920
Then we only show him a small part of the paper collection

32:57.920 --> 32:59.920
These social relations

32:59.920 --> 33:01.920
Then again, uh, he

33:01.920 --> 33:05.920
It can be used in some, uh, more large-scale data collection

33:05.920 --> 33:08.920
Because we actually don't have too much burden on people

33:08.920 --> 33:10.920
If this group is hundreds of people

33:10.920 --> 33:13.920
Uh, or, uh, thousands of people

33:13.920 --> 33:15.920
Maybe you can do that

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
What are his shortcomings

33:17.920 --> 33:20.920
One of his shortcomings is, uh, like I just mentioned

33:20.920 --> 33:22.920
Is that everyone's perception may be much worse

33:22.920 --> 33:26.920
Or they may have some mistakes in the middle

33:26.920 --> 33:27.920
Is that he may know

33:27.920 --> 33:31.920
What he knows is different from other people's subjective judgment

33:31.920 --> 33:34.920
Like me, I might know, uh, the first one

33:34.920 --> 33:37.920
But I don't think there's a link between D and E

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
They know, but they don't know

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
Maybe, but D and E

33:40.920 --> 33:42.920
Maybe they actually know each other

33:42.920 --> 33:43.920
I might make a mistake

33:43.920 --> 33:45.920
That's another one

33:45.920 --> 33:48.920
I'm from a lot of different, uh, participants

33:48.920 --> 33:50.920
To report the relationship between D and E

33:50.920 --> 33:53.920
There may be a lot of, uh, contradictions

33:53.920 --> 33:54.920
Or it's inconsistent

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
Inconsistency may be very high

33:55.920 --> 33:58.920
We have to find a way to, uh, create a model

33:58.920 --> 34:01.920
To deal with these problems

34:01.920 --> 34:04.920
Okay, so this is what we, uh, are doing

34:04.920 --> 34:05.920
This real-life study

34:05.920 --> 34:08.920
We have, uh, human scientists squatting

34:08.920 --> 34:11.920
A few small villages in Alaska

34:11.920 --> 34:14.920
Their characteristics are, uh, the summer sun is long

34:14.920 --> 34:15.920
Winter sun is short

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
And then, uh, there's a lot of pressure

34:17.920 --> 34:19.920
And then the alcohol problem is a little serious

34:19.920 --> 34:21.920
And then their, uh, income

34:21.920 --> 34:23.920
Uh, it's probably not very high

34:23.920 --> 34:25.920
That's just the connection between people

34:25.920 --> 34:27.920
It's very strong

34:27.920 --> 34:30.920
Okay, we, uh, we found a village

34:30.920 --> 34:32.920
To do this, uh, real-life study

34:32.920 --> 34:36.920
That village is probably, uh, about 400 people

34:36.920 --> 34:39.920
And then they're about 95% American

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
That their median income

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
The median annual income is about $30,000

34:43.920 --> 34:45.920
So it's just not very rich

34:45.920 --> 34:47.920
So what we want to see is

34:47.920 --> 34:50.920
Some of their mutual help

34:50.920 --> 34:51.920
Who will provide help

34:51.920 --> 34:53.920
Who will get help

34:53.920 --> 34:55.920
And their suicide prevention

34:55.920 --> 34:56.920
It's just over there

34:56.920 --> 34:58.920
I just mentioned that his adult male suicide rate

34:58.920 --> 34:59.920
Will be higher than other regions

34:59.920 --> 35:01.920
Then we want to look at suicide prevention

35:01.920 --> 35:05.920
Then we invited, uh, 170 people to join us

35:05.920 --> 35:07.920
Our research is actually easy to adopt

35:07.920 --> 35:09.920
That they're probably half of the people

35:09.920 --> 35:11.920
Maybe 40% of the people to join this study

35:11.920 --> 35:15.920
Uh, uh, this data collection process

35:15.920 --> 35:16.920
It took about seven days

35:16.920 --> 35:18.920
And then every, uh, participant

35:18.920 --> 35:20.920
It only takes 10 to 20 minutes

35:20.920 --> 35:22.920
To judge some of the relationships between people

35:22.920 --> 35:25.920
Then we give him $20 each time

35:25.920 --> 35:27.920
Then they have a fee

35:27.920 --> 35:30.920
Okay, so this is very similar to what I just introduced

35:30.920 --> 35:33.920
Once we show him 40 people

35:33.920 --> 35:34.920
Or photos

35:34.920 --> 35:37.920
Then he has to do three things, uh, three types

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
The first one is this person

35:39.920 --> 35:41.920
Uh, he's a victim or a participant

35:41.920 --> 35:43.920
He knows and is familiar

35:43.920 --> 35:46.920
The second person is this victim

35:46.920 --> 35:48.920
He knows, but not necessarily

35:48.920 --> 35:50.920
The third person he doesn't know

35:50.920 --> 35:53.920
Then we, because the third person

35:53.920 --> 35:55.920
In fact, this person can't judge

35:55.920 --> 35:56.920
He doesn't know him at all

35:56.920 --> 35:59.920
So now we're looking at the first and the second

35:59.920 --> 36:00.920
The first person is familiar

36:00.920 --> 36:02.920
The second person is not familiar

36:02.920 --> 36:05.920
The first kind of people are usually family members

36:05.920 --> 36:07.920
Is your parents or siblings

36:07.920 --> 36:10.920
This person, the first class, is much less than the second class

36:10.920 --> 36:13.920
Then we think the first class of information is too strong

36:13.920 --> 36:15.920
Then we only use the second class of information

36:15.920 --> 36:17.920
We ask these participants

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
Only the second class of people you know

36:19.920 --> 36:20.920
But not very familiar

36:20.920 --> 36:23.920
And then we put these people's photos

36:23.920 --> 36:27.920
And then let the participants, the victims, come to the five categories

36:27.920 --> 36:29.920
In five boxes or buckets

36:29.920 --> 36:31.920
That's what we told him

36:31.920 --> 36:32.920
The same bucket of conditions

36:32.920 --> 36:33.920
It's these people

36:33.920 --> 36:35.920
You think he's in the same social group

36:35.920 --> 36:37.920
Or you think these people are familiar

36:37.920 --> 36:39.920
Okay, so we've done it

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
Put one and two together

36:40.920 --> 36:41.920
Know very familiar

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
He knows and is not familiar

36:42.920 --> 36:43.920
I've also done it, just put two

36:43.920 --> 36:46.920
These two results are similar

36:46.920 --> 36:48.920
Okay, so we're still

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
Uh, to these people

36:50.920 --> 36:52.920
He also took some of his characteristics

36:52.920 --> 36:54.920
It's like he's not going to do this

36:54.920 --> 36:56.920
The community has positive contributions

36:56.920 --> 36:57.920
It's A1

36:57.920 --> 36:59.920
Will he help young people?

36:59.920 --> 37:00.920
It's A2

37:00.920 --> 37:01.920
Does he have a drinking problem?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.920
Or is he causing trouble?

37:03.920 --> 37:08.920
Or is he doing something bad?

37:15.920 --> 37:17.920
So what we're looking at now is

37:17.920 --> 37:20.920
How do we build this social network?

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
That's the main way we build it

37:22.920 --> 37:24.920
It's based on these victims

37:25.920 --> 37:27.920
To divide people into five groups

37:27.920 --> 37:29.920
This way to build a social network

37:29.920 --> 37:31.920
Our starting point is like this

37:31.920 --> 37:34.920
If there are a lot of people today

37:34.920 --> 37:37.920
He put both of them in the same box

37:37.920 --> 37:40.920
We have a high degree of certainty

37:40.920 --> 37:41.920
We'll take it

37:41.920 --> 37:43.920
I think these two people should be very

37:43.920 --> 37:45.920
It should be very likely to know

37:45.920 --> 37:48.920
It should be very likely to have this positive relationship

37:48.920 --> 37:50.920
So if today

37:50.920 --> 37:52.920
A lot of people report that these two people

37:52.920 --> 37:53.920
It doesn't matter

37:53.920 --> 37:55.920
We divide it into different boxes

37:55.920 --> 37:57.920
Then we have a lot of confidence

37:57.920 --> 37:59.920
Say these two people should have nothing to do with it

37:59.920 --> 38:00.920
If it doesn't matter

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
We'll give him a negative tie

38:01.920 --> 38:02.920
Negative tie

38:02.920 --> 38:04.920
It's not that they have hostility

38:04.920 --> 38:05.920
It's that they are

38:05.920 --> 38:06.920
We have a lot of confidence

38:06.920 --> 38:08.920
They should have nothing to do with it

38:08.920 --> 38:09.920
So we're going to build this

38:09.920 --> 38:11.920
The basis of the judgment

38:11.920 --> 38:14.920
Okay, so we're going to talk about it

38:14.920 --> 38:17.920
We take it as a random comparison

38:17.920 --> 38:19.920
If you say two people

38:19.920 --> 38:21.920
We'll see

38:21.920 --> 38:23.920
People put

38:23.920 --> 38:25.920
Uh, two people in the same box

38:25.920 --> 38:26.920
What is the probability?

38:26.920 --> 38:27.920
It's completely random

38:27.920 --> 38:28.920
How much

38:28.920 --> 38:29.920
And then we see

38:29.920 --> 38:30.920
He

38:30.920 --> 38:32.920
Two people are put in the same box

38:32.920 --> 38:34.920
How much is it different from random

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
So we're going to have a

38:35.920 --> 38:37.920
If there's a no model

38:37.920 --> 38:39.920
Let's look at this

38:39.920 --> 38:41.920
And then there's some calculation

38:41.920 --> 38:43.920
Is that people really put this two people

38:43.920 --> 38:45.920
The probability of putting the same box

38:45.920 --> 38:47.920
The probability of putting two people in different boxes

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
We can use some

38:48.920 --> 38:50.920
The combination of mathematical methods to calculate

38:50.920 --> 38:51.920
Calculate his odds

38:51.920 --> 38:53.920
And this is a false assumption

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
We want to compare

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
A reference standard

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
So we're looking at

38:56.920 --> 38:58.920
How far is he from this standard

38:58.920 --> 38:59.920
The farther away

38:59.920 --> 39:00.920
That means we're going to

39:00.920 --> 39:01.920
This matter

39:01.920 --> 39:02.920
These things

39:02.920 --> 39:03.920
They should have something to do with it

39:03.920 --> 39:04.920
Or it shouldn't have anything to do with it

39:04.920 --> 39:05.920
This judgment

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
It's going to be more and more intense

39:07.920 --> 39:09.920
Okay, and then it's the same thing

39:09.920 --> 39:10.920
That's what we're looking at

39:10.920 --> 39:11.920
What's the probability

39:11.920 --> 39:13.920
So let's look at this example

39:13.920 --> 39:15.920
There are 393 people in this village

39:15.920 --> 39:17.920
And we've got 172 people

39:17.920 --> 39:18.920
Experimental research

39:18.920 --> 39:19.920
That we

39:19.920 --> 39:20.920
This B is equal to 50

39:20.920 --> 39:22.920
We let him put five boxes

39:22.920 --> 39:23.920
That K is equal to 40

39:23.920 --> 39:25.920
They look at 40 photos at a time

39:25.920 --> 39:27.920
Gamma is equal to 0.76

39:27.920 --> 39:29.920
They know 76% of them

39:29.920 --> 39:31.920
On average, one person knows

39:31.920 --> 39:32.920
Of the 40 people

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
Maybe 76% of the people

39:34.920 --> 39:36.920
So we're going to look at one

39:36.920 --> 39:38.920
This is from a false assumption

39:38.920 --> 39:40.920
A no model

39:40.920 --> 39:42.920
That's what he is

39:42.920 --> 39:44.920
What we're looking at is

39:44.920 --> 39:46.920
5% of the end odds

39:47.920 --> 39:49.920
If there are two people, three people, four people

39:49.920 --> 39:53.920
Here's a 1.61, 0.1, 0.01 percentage

39:53.920 --> 39:55.920
If he falls in

39:55.920 --> 39:57.920
Uh, more than two people, more than three people

39:57.920 --> 39:58.920
More than four people

39:58.920 --> 40:00.920
If you put it in the same box

40:00.920 --> 40:02.920
We think

40:02.920 --> 40:06.920
These two people have a lot to do with it

40:06.920 --> 40:08.920
Because this is from no model

40:08.920 --> 40:09.920
Let's compare

40:09.920 --> 40:11.920
Let's look at 5% of the end odds

40:11.920 --> 40:12.920
A point

40:12.920 --> 40:13.920
That this is

40:13.920 --> 40:14.920
There are up to 5% of the end odds

40:15.920 --> 40:16.920
If it's more than two people

40:16.920 --> 40:18.920
If you put them in the same box

40:18.920 --> 40:19.920
We think

40:19.920 --> 40:22.920
These two people have a positive relationship

40:22.920 --> 40:24.920
Okay, the same way

40:24.920 --> 40:26.920
We can also make another version

40:26.920 --> 40:27.920
No model is

40:27.920 --> 40:28.920
How many people are there

40:28.920 --> 40:30.920
Put these two people in different boxes

40:30.920 --> 40:31.920
We'll say

40:31.920 --> 40:32.920
These two people should have nothing to do with it

40:32.920 --> 40:34.920
Then we still take 5% as an end point

40:34.920 --> 40:36.920
Start counting from the back

40:36.920 --> 40:38.920
From six people, five people, four people, three people

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
Stop

40:39.920 --> 40:41.920
That's less than 5%

40:41.920 --> 40:43.920
So if there are three people

40:43.920 --> 40:45.920
Put two people

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
Maybe it's D and E

40:46.920 --> 40:47.920
Put it in different boxes

40:47.920 --> 40:48.920
We'll think

40:48.920 --> 40:50.920
Okay, that's it

40:50.920 --> 40:51.920
Uh, these two people

40:51.920 --> 40:52.920
D and E should be

40:52.920 --> 40:54.920
There is a significant relationship

40:54.920 --> 40:56.920
Or a significant lack of knowledge

40:56.920 --> 40:58.920
Ah, that's it

40:58.920 --> 40:59.920
This is what we just talked about

40:59.920 --> 41:01.920
Is that you take 5% as an end point

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920
Or 5% as an end point

41:03.920 --> 41:05.920
Then use the way of building the network just now

41:05.920 --> 41:08.920
You can build two networks

41:08.920 --> 41:10.920
The first one is a network with a positive relationship

41:10.920 --> 41:12.920
The positive relationship is black

41:12.920 --> 41:14.920
The second is a network with a negative relationship

41:14.920 --> 41:16.920
We use red to show the negative relationship

41:16.920 --> 41:17.920
So these points are the same

41:17.920 --> 41:19.920
Then we can build

41:19.920 --> 41:21.920
It has two symbol networks

41:21.920 --> 41:22.920
One is a positive network

41:22.920 --> 41:24.920
A negative network

41:24.920 --> 41:27.920
Then we have some data on these networks

41:27.920 --> 41:29.920
The data is that it has

41:29.920 --> 41:31.920
These two networks actually look very similar

41:31.920 --> 41:33.920
That's because there are some points

41:33.920 --> 41:34.920
It's not drawn

41:34.920 --> 41:35.920
So there are fewer points on the negative network

41:35.920 --> 41:37.920
Then its density is very similar

41:37.920 --> 41:39.920
Then its average distance is very similar

41:39.920 --> 41:41.920
Then its centrality is very similar

41:41.920 --> 41:43.920
These two networks actually look very similar

41:43.920 --> 41:45.920
Ok, then we can still follow

41:45.920 --> 41:48.920
Ah, the positive network and the negative network characteristics just now

41:48.920 --> 41:50.920
Sort the network groups

41:50.920 --> 41:52.920
Ah, you may have heard of some

41:52.920 --> 41:54.920
Is to group the points of the network

41:54.920 --> 41:56.920
What does grouping mean

41:56.920 --> 41:57.920
Grouping is

41:57.920 --> 42:00.920
Ah, if you see a network

42:00.920 --> 42:02.920
It has a lot of connections within a group

42:02.920 --> 42:04.920
If there are very few connections between groups

42:04.920 --> 42:06.920
Then the result of this grouping should be good

42:06.920 --> 42:07.920
Just like

42:07.920 --> 42:10.920
Ah, you can use their department to group college students

42:10.920 --> 42:12.920
Or use their hospital to group

42:12.920 --> 42:15.920
The connection between groups should be

42:15.920 --> 42:17.920
Much less than the connection between groups

42:17.920 --> 42:19.920
Much less

42:19.920 --> 42:21.920
So we have this positive network

42:21.920 --> 42:22.920
If you have a negative network

42:22.920 --> 42:23.920
We think

42:23.920 --> 42:25.920
A reasonable classification is a group

42:25.920 --> 42:28.920
There should be a lot of positive connections in the middle

42:28.920 --> 42:30.920
There should be a lot of negative connections between groups

42:30.920 --> 42:32.920
So if we have a positive and a negative network

42:32.920 --> 42:34.920
Then we can group

42:34.920 --> 42:36.920
Then let's see

42:36.920 --> 42:38.920
The final grouping result will be the best

42:38.920 --> 42:39.920
Ah, here

42:39.920 --> 42:41.920
Ah, it turns out that the result of grouping six groups is the best

42:41.920 --> 42:43.920
Its balance score is the lowest

42:43.920 --> 42:45.920
The lowest means that its grouping effect is the best

42:45.920 --> 42:47.920
Then we divide these networks into six groups

42:47.920 --> 42:49.920
Ah, after dividing into six groups

42:49.920 --> 42:51.920
It probably looks like this

42:51.920 --> 42:53.920
Ah, then we can

42:53.920 --> 42:55.920
To these groups

42:55.920 --> 42:57.920
Describe some of the characteristics

42:57.920 --> 42:58.920
Because we just said

42:58.920 --> 42:59.920
We asked these people

42:59.920 --> 43:01.920
Ah, what are the characteristics

43:01.920 --> 43:02.920
He is willing to help others

43:02.920 --> 43:03.920
Then he

43:03.920 --> 43:07.920
Ah, will there be some alcoholism or suicidal tendencies

43:07.920 --> 43:09.920
Then we will do it to these six groups

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
Ah, like using multinomial

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
To see what characteristics they have

43:13.920 --> 43:14.920
We will find one

43:14.920 --> 43:16.920
The largest group as the baseline

43:16.920 --> 43:17.920
As a benchmark

43:17.920 --> 43:19.920
Look at the other five groups and the benchmark

43:19.920 --> 43:21.920
What are its characteristics

43:21.920 --> 43:24.920
Ah, the third category is the largest

43:24.920 --> 43:25.920
The third group is the largest

43:25.920 --> 43:26.920
Then we can

43:26.920 --> 43:28.920
Give some connections to other groups

43:28.920 --> 43:30.920
If there is help, give him some connections

43:30.920 --> 43:32.920
The first group of people is him

43:32.920 --> 43:35.920
Ah, if he finds his friend

43:35.920 --> 43:37.920
Ah, make some trouble

43:37.920 --> 43:39.920
The first group of people will help him

43:39.920 --> 43:43.920
Ah, here are some of the characteristics of each group

43:43.920 --> 43:44.920
Some groups have no characteristics

43:44.920 --> 43:45.920
Like the fourth group of people

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
Maybe it's the same as the third group

43:47.920 --> 43:49.920
It's not on this

43:49.920 --> 43:52.920
Okay, so this, uh, this part

43:52.920 --> 43:54.920
We just look at

43:54.920 --> 43:56.920
Use a network sampling method

43:56.920 --> 43:57.920
Use a third party report

43:57.920 --> 44:00.920
To restore a well-known mainstream network

44:00.920 --> 44:02.920
Then we look at this network

44:03.920 --> 44:05.920
Objective response

44:05.920 --> 44:06.920
Say this person is my friend

44:06.920 --> 44:07.920
This person is not my friend

44:07.920 --> 44:09.920
What is the difference between this network

44:09.920 --> 44:10.920
Then we found that this relationship

44:10.920 --> 44:12.920
About 50%

44:12.920 --> 44:13.920
As for

44:13.920 --> 44:15.920
Ah, what are the reasons

44:15.920 --> 44:17.920
What are the reasons that make a person more accurate

44:17.920 --> 44:18.920
More accurate judgment

44:18.920 --> 44:19.920
What are the reasons that make a person more inaccurate judgment

44:19.920 --> 44:21.920
This is what we need to study later

44:21.920 --> 44:23.920
Then we also put these people

44:23.920 --> 44:25.920
Ah, some of his characteristics

44:25.920 --> 44:27.920
Ah, find it out

44:27.920 --> 44:29.920
Then we also put this subjective network

44:29.920 --> 44:31.920
Do some classification

44:31.920 --> 44:33.920
Okay, this one

44:33.920 --> 44:35.920
Um, the plan can be extended

44:35.920 --> 44:38.920
Ah, some of the possibilities that can be extended

44:38.920 --> 44:40.920
We can change his

44:40.920 --> 44:41.920
Sample size

44:41.920 --> 44:43.920
Is to change the proportion of his sample

44:43.920 --> 44:44.920
Ah, or the number

44:44.920 --> 44:45.920
Then we can change

44:45.920 --> 44:47.920
The number of boxes

44:47.920 --> 44:48.920
We all have to say

44:48.920 --> 44:49.920
These conditions will be

44:49.920 --> 44:52.920
Ah, what kind of impact will we have on the final result

44:52.920 --> 44:53.920
That

44:53.920 --> 44:55.920
We have to compare again

44:55.920 --> 44:57.920
Our subjective social network

44:57.920 --> 44:58.920
With the general traditional

44:58.920 --> 45:00.920
What is the difference between everyone's social network

45:00.920 --> 45:01.920
Some people can see it

45:01.920 --> 45:02.920
Some people can't see it

45:02.920 --> 45:03.920
These are the things that need to be studied later

45:03.920 --> 45:04.920
That

45:04.920 --> 45:05.920
His way of research

45:05.920 --> 45:07.920
He can also be extended to other circumstances

45:07.920 --> 45:09.920
He doesn't have to be in a village

45:09.920 --> 45:10.920
He can be

45:10.920 --> 45:12.920
Ah, some small groups

45:12.920 --> 45:15.920
Just like a company or a university

45:15.920 --> 45:17.920
About hundreds of people

45:17.920 --> 45:19.920
Then you give a part of the people

45:19.920 --> 45:21.920
To participate in this

45:21.920 --> 45:22.920
Investigation

45:22.920 --> 45:23.920
Show him dozens of people's photos

45:23.920 --> 45:25.920
Then let him do similar things

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
But

45:26.920 --> 45:27.920
He has this extent of restriction

45:27.920 --> 45:28.920
He may be in a city

45:28.920 --> 45:29.920
There is no way to do this

45:29.920 --> 45:31.920
So we are probably a small group

45:31.920 --> 45:33.920
We can do similar things

45:33.920 --> 45:35.920
Okay, this is the first one I want to talk about

45:35.920 --> 45:37.920
That second part is

45:37.920 --> 45:38.920
I want to measure

45:38.920 --> 45:39.920
In this network

45:39.920 --> 45:41.920
We do some intervention measures

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
I want to judge this intervention measure

45:42.920 --> 45:44.920
Is there any effect of external spread

45:44.920 --> 45:45.920
Or this

45:45.920 --> 45:47.920
This intervention measure is actually useless

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
He is

45:48.920 --> 45:50.920
Better than we expected

45:50.920 --> 45:52.920
Okay, this intervention measure

45:52.920 --> 45:55.920
Uh, his feature is that he has a social network behind him

45:55.920 --> 45:57.920
That is, we already know that these people

45:57.920 --> 45:58.920
What does the social network look like?

45:58.920 --> 46:00.920
This social network is different from the social network we just talked about

46:00.920 --> 46:01.920
Not everyone

46:01.920 --> 46:03.920
The third party judges the subjective social network

46:03.920 --> 46:05.920
It is the social network reported by everyone

46:05.920 --> 46:07.920
We know these people

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
Under the social network

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
We want to see

46:09.920 --> 46:11.920
For these people

46:11.920 --> 46:12.920
Willing to come

46:12.920 --> 46:14.920
Uh, maybe improve your own health behavior

46:14.920 --> 46:15.920
We give him this intervention measure

46:15.920 --> 46:16.920
We want to see

46:16.920 --> 46:18.920
A few months later

46:18.920 --> 46:20.920
How strong is the effect of this intervention measure

46:20.920 --> 46:22.920
Can we quantify this strength

46:22.920 --> 46:24.920
Okay, so

46:24.920 --> 46:26.920
Uh, what we do is still

46:26.920 --> 46:27.920
This

46:27.920 --> 46:28.920
Uh, in this community

46:28.920 --> 46:30.920
We let these people participate in our

46:30.920 --> 46:32.920
This health behavior improvement measure

46:32.920 --> 46:34.920
What about this health behavior improvement measure?

46:34.920 --> 46:36.920
We are going to do some suicide prevention

46:36.920 --> 46:37.920
Behavior

46:37.920 --> 46:38.920
That's what we want to say

46:38.920 --> 46:41.920
Hey, actually your mental state is very important

46:41.920 --> 46:43.920
And then you have to take care of others often

46:43.920 --> 46:44.920
Or you have to know

46:44.920 --> 46:46.920
Your own mental health

46:46.920 --> 46:48.920
Is there any risk?

46:48.920 --> 46:49.920
Is there any danger?

46:49.920 --> 46:51.920
You have to get some support from society

46:51.920 --> 46:53.920
it is good

46:53.920 --> 46:55.920
What is the way we use

46:55.920 --> 46:57.920
The way we use it is

46:57.920 --> 47:00.920
Uh, we first need to have a social network map

47:00.920 --> 47:01.920
Is that we have to know first

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
Say this

47:02.920 --> 47:03.920
The people in this village

47:03.920 --> 47:05.920
They, uh, people and people are each other

47:05.920 --> 47:06.920
How is it

47:06.920 --> 47:08.920
Uh, there is this social relationship

47:08.920 --> 47:10.920
Then again, we have to look at

47:10.920 --> 47:12.920
Uh, what are we measuring?

47:12.920 --> 47:14.920
What we want to measure is this intervention measure

47:14.920 --> 47:15.920
Does it work?

47:15.920 --> 47:16.920
Then we have to look at

47:16.920 --> 47:18.920
Hey, today I'm talking about

47:18.920 --> 47:20.920
Suppose I'm going to look at smoking

47:20.920 --> 47:21.920
I'll look at smoking

47:21.920 --> 47:23.920
Uh, at the first time

47:23.920 --> 47:25.920
We look at everyone's smoking

47:25.920 --> 47:26.920
Then the second time

47:26.920 --> 47:29.920
Or, uh, other health behaviors

47:29.920 --> 47:30.920
Then look at the second wave

47:30.920 --> 47:31.920
The second time

47:31.920 --> 47:33.920
Have these people's health behaviors changed

47:33.920 --> 47:35.920
Through our intervention measures

47:35.920 --> 47:37.920
Then we have to know

47:37.920 --> 47:39.920
We can only do this

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
Some of the points in the network

47:40.920 --> 47:43.920
Interference in their behavior

47:43.920 --> 47:45.920
We might be with some of them

47:45.920 --> 47:47.920
To participate in this, uh,

47:47.920 --> 47:50.920
Some education on this bad behavior

47:50.920 --> 47:52.920
We hope to change their behavior

47:52.920 --> 47:53.920
Then we want to see

47:53.920 --> 47:54.920
These interventions

47:54.920 --> 47:56.920
Did it spread to their neighbors?

47:56.920 --> 47:58.920
Because they're a pretty small group

47:58.920 --> 47:59.920
And it's a very tight group

47:59.920 --> 48:01.920
We want to see this intervention measure

48:01.920 --> 48:04.920
The spread effect on this network

48:04.920 --> 48:06.920
Okay, uh, just like I said

48:06.920 --> 48:08.920
We're doing this, uh, suicide prevention research

48:08.920 --> 48:10.920
Let's see

48:10.920 --> 48:12.920
Uh, the main thing is to look at the network

48:12.920 --> 48:14.920
The relationship between a pair of diets

48:14.920 --> 48:15.920
What is diet diet?

48:15.920 --> 48:17.920
Um, if there's a link between A and B

48:17.920 --> 48:18.920
He's a diet

48:18.920 --> 48:19.920
If there's no link, it's a diet

48:19.920 --> 48:21.920
It's a pair of pairs

48:21.920 --> 48:23.920
It's a pair of pairs

48:23.920 --> 48:27.920
The main thing is to see if there's a relationship like this

48:27.920 --> 48:29.920
He's on the Internet

48:29.920 --> 48:31.920
His good behavior or bad behavior

48:31.920 --> 48:33.920
Is there any significant change?

48:33.920 --> 48:34.920
In every wave

48:34.920 --> 48:35.920
In two waves

48:35.920 --> 48:37.920
Is there any significant change?

48:37.920 --> 48:41.920
Okay, uh, we're going to build this model now

48:41.920 --> 48:43.920
How to build this model

48:43.920 --> 48:44.920
Because, uh, we know

48:44.920 --> 48:47.920
We only have this part of the people on the Internet

48:47.920 --> 48:49.920
Give them this participatory research

48:49.920 --> 48:51.920
So what about the first variable A?

48:51.920 --> 48:54.920
The first variable A is, uh, we have a picture first

48:54.920 --> 48:55.920
It's on G

48:55.920 --> 48:56.920
G is the name of the network

48:56.920 --> 49:00.920
The meaning of the network is that he has a point V and a link E

49:00.920 --> 49:02.920
That A is a function of V

49:02.920 --> 49:05.920
That is, V is every point

49:05.920 --> 49:07.920
Did he participate in our intervention measures?

49:07.920 --> 49:10.920
Or, uh, the suicide prevention of this behavior

49:10.920 --> 49:11.920
This lecture

49:11.920 --> 49:14.920
If he's involved, he'll give him E

49:14.920 --> 49:16.920
If you're not involved, give him 0

49:16.920 --> 49:18.920
Okay, what about the second part of B?

49:18.920 --> 49:20.920
B is looking at his behavior

49:20.920 --> 49:22.920
Is there any change in his state?

49:22.920 --> 49:24.920
So he has two time points

49:24.920 --> 49:25.920
He's at the zero point

49:25.920 --> 49:28.920
He's not yet, uh, he's not yet involved

49:28.920 --> 49:31.920
His behavior before this suicide prevention lecture

49:31.920 --> 49:33.920
If he has this behavior

49:33.920 --> 49:34.920
Is E

49:34.920 --> 49:36.920
Maybe this behavior is a bad behavior

49:36.920 --> 49:37.920
It's like smoking

49:37.920 --> 49:38.920
Maybe there's a suicide tendency

49:38.920 --> 49:39.920
He's E

49:39.920 --> 49:41.920
So at the second time point

49:41.920 --> 49:44.920
Time point E is that they're already, uh, prevention

49:44.920 --> 49:45.920
The behavior has passed

49:45.920 --> 49:46.920
Intervention has passed

49:46.920 --> 49:47.920
But this person doesn't necessarily participate

49:47.920 --> 49:48.920
But he's still in this state

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
Change

49:49.920 --> 49:50.920
Zero is not in this state

49:50.920 --> 49:51.920
E is in this state

49:51.920 --> 49:54.920
So we have six numbers

49:54.920 --> 49:55.920
To record the whole process

49:55.920 --> 49:56.920
The first one is A

49:56.920 --> 49:58.920
A is whether he participated in this intervention

49:58.920 --> 50:02.920
B is in under two times

50:02.920 --> 50:04.920
Is he showing this behavior?

50:04.920 --> 50:06.920
So he has four in B

50:06.920 --> 50:08.920
Uh, there are four divisions

50:08.920 --> 50:10.920
If A, there are two divisions

50:10.920 --> 50:15.920
So let's see

50:15.920 --> 50:17.920
He's under two points in time

50:17.920 --> 50:19.920
T0 and T1

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
We're going to look at his

50:20.920 --> 50:22.920
Uh, all these diets

50:22.920 --> 50:23.920
These pairs of

50:23.920 --> 50:25.920
His behavior changes

50:25.920 --> 50:28.920
So let's make some records

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
Because we're looking at every one of them

50:29.920 --> 50:30.920
It's diet

50:30.920 --> 50:33.920
It's X and Y

50:33.920 --> 50:34.920
Suppose we're looking at

50:34.920 --> 50:36.920
Uh, UV, this pair

50:36.920 --> 50:37.920
UV, he's on the Internet

50:37.920 --> 50:38.920
There are links

50:38.920 --> 50:39.920
He is

50:39.920 --> 50:40.920
U and V are friends

50:40.920 --> 50:42.920
Then they have a link in the middle

50:42.920 --> 50:44.920
Then we're going to look at

50:44.920 --> 50:46.920
In the way of this record

50:46.920 --> 50:48.920
His, uh, participation

50:48.920 --> 50:50.920
What is the value of this behavior?

50:50.920 --> 50:52.920
So the bottom is

50:52.920 --> 50:54.920
We're calculating this XY PQR

50:54.920 --> 50:56.920
PQRS

50:56.920 --> 50:57.920
What is XY?

50:57.920 --> 50:59.920
XY is this point

50:59.920 --> 51:01.920
Does he participate in this way?

51:01.920 --> 51:03.920
What is the y-axis?

51:03.920 --> 51:04.920
What is the y-division?

51:04.920 --> 51:05.920
The y-division is point B

51:05.920 --> 51:07.920
Did you participate in this way?

51:07.920 --> 51:08.920
What about P?

51:08.920 --> 51:10.920
P is point U

51:10.920 --> 51:11.920
He's in the zero time

51:11.920 --> 51:12.920
He has

51:12.920 --> 51:15.920
He has this behavior in the zero time

51:15.920 --> 51:17.920
That Q is point V

51:17.920 --> 51:19.920
Is there this behavior in the zero time?

51:19.920 --> 51:21.920
R is point U

51:21.920 --> 51:23.920
Is there this behavior in T equals 1?

51:23.920 --> 51:25.920
S is point V

51:25.920 --> 51:27.920
Is there this behavior in T equals 1?

51:27.920 --> 51:29.920
So let's do some

51:29.920 --> 51:30.920
The changes in the amount

51:30.920 --> 51:31.920
This is all

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
This looks a little complicated

51:32.920 --> 51:33.920
But he's just a

51:33.920 --> 51:34.920
Bookkeeping

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
He's just recording

51:35.920 --> 51:36.920
XY PQRZ

51:36.920 --> 51:38.920
The amount of this thing

51:38.920 --> 51:39.920
X can be equal to 0

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
It can be equal to 1

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
Y can be equal to 0

51:41.920 --> 51:42.920
It can be equal to 1

51:42.920 --> 51:43.920
S can be equal to 0

51:43.920 --> 51:44.920
It can be equal to 1

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
So we're going to record

51:45.920 --> 51:47.920
The number of changes in these things

51:47.920 --> 51:48.920
Let's give an example

51:48.920 --> 51:50.920
The example is

51:50.920 --> 51:52.920
I'm looking at XY PQRS

51:52.920 --> 51:55.920
But I might be looking at a T

51:55.920 --> 51:57.920
What I'm looking at is a 1 0

51:57.920 --> 51:58.920
1 1 0 1

51:58.920 --> 51:59.920
What does this mean?

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
This is XY

52:00.920 --> 52:01.920
What about this pair?

52:01.920 --> 52:03.920
X participates in the defense

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
X is 1

52:04.920 --> 52:05.920
Y does not participate in the defense

52:05.920 --> 52:06.920
Y is 0

52:06.920 --> 52:08.920
X at T time

52:08.920 --> 52:10.920
He has this bad behavior

52:10.920 --> 52:11.920
Is 1

52:11.920 --> 52:12.920
Y at T equals 0 time

52:12.920 --> 52:14.920
He also has this behavior

52:14.920 --> 52:15.920
Is 1

52:15.920 --> 52:17.920
At T equals 1

52:17.920 --> 52:18.920
When T1

52:18.920 --> 52:20.920
X no longer has this behavior

52:20.920 --> 52:21.920
It becomes 0

52:21.920 --> 52:22.920
But Y still has this behavior

52:22.920 --> 52:23.920
He is 1

52:23.920 --> 52:24.920
Then we have to look at this

52:24.920 --> 52:25.920
How many pairs are there?

52:25.920 --> 52:26.920
So we just saw

52:26.920 --> 52:27.920
This has a total of

52:27.920 --> 52:29.920
The combination of 2 and 6 squares

52:29.920 --> 52:30.920
We have to look at 64 values

52:30.920 --> 52:32.920
How many changes does it have?

52:32.920 --> 52:33.920
Ok

52:33.920 --> 52:34.920
Then we can put

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
Just this thing

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
Make a table

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
This is a map

52:37.920 --> 52:39.920
Then we can divide it into

52:39.920 --> 52:41.920
X participates

52:41.920 --> 52:42.920
Y participates

52:42.920 --> 52:43.920
Or X did not participate

52:43.920 --> 52:44.920
Y did not participate in this combination

52:44.920 --> 52:45.920
Then look again

52:45.920 --> 52:47.920
Do they have these bad behaviors?

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
If there is a bad behavior, it is a black dot

52:48.920 --> 52:50.920
No bad behavior is a white dot

52:50.920 --> 52:51.920
Then we can put

52:51.920 --> 52:54.920
The total of 64 numbers

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
Recorded on this

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
Then we have to look at this

52:56.920 --> 52:59.920
64 numbers and time changes

52:59.920 --> 53:00.920
That

53:00.920 --> 53:01.920
Next is the social scientist

53:01.920 --> 53:05.920
Some values of concern

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
The first one is

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
We want to see

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
This intervention

53:08.920 --> 53:10.920
For the participants themselves

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
Does it have positive results?

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
Is there a positive effect?

53:12.920 --> 53:14.920
It is direct treatment success

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
In a social context

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
Is in this social network

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
We give it directly

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
This intervention

53:18.920 --> 53:19.920
For this person

53:19.920 --> 53:21.920
Does it have a good result?

53:21.920 --> 53:22.920
The second is direct prevention

53:22.920 --> 53:24.920
In a social context

53:24.920 --> 53:25.920
If this person

53:25.920 --> 53:26.920
If there is no bad behavior

53:26.920 --> 53:27.920
We give him this intervention

53:27.920 --> 53:29.920
Can he continue to maintain

53:29.920 --> 53:30.920
He did not have this bad behavior

53:30.920 --> 53:32.920
The following m3 to m8

53:32.920 --> 53:34.920
Is similar to some

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
Some of the values we see

53:35.920 --> 53:36.920
I will not go into details here

53:36.920 --> 53:39.920
Ok, m1 is what I just said

53:39.920 --> 53:42.920
If this person participates in preventive measures

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
Will he

53:43.920 --> 53:45.920
At the next time

53:45.920 --> 53:46.920
Is to improve

53:46.920 --> 53:49.920
He may have this bad behavior

53:49.920 --> 53:50.920
There was no bad behavior later

53:50.920 --> 53:51.920
This is this person himself

53:51.920 --> 53:53.920
Then we have to look

53:53.920 --> 53:55.920
Corresponding to within those 64 brackets

53:55.920 --> 53:57.920
I have to look at these eight

53:57.920 --> 53:59.920
The change in the value

53:59.920 --> 54:01.920
The left side is red

54:01.920 --> 54:02.920
Deep red

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
The right side is this pink

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
Plus the alignment

54:04.920 --> 54:06.920
I have to look at these two time points

54:06.920 --> 54:07.920
Within

54:07.920 --> 54:08.920
The difference between the two numbers

54:08.920 --> 54:10.920
Is there a difference?

54:10.920 --> 54:12.920
Is there a difference between this and no model?

54:12.920 --> 54:14.920
That this is m1

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
This indicator

54:15.920 --> 54:16.920
That m2 indicator is

54:16.920 --> 54:18.920
If this person today

54:18.920 --> 54:20.920
He was at t equal to 0

54:20.920 --> 54:21.920
At the time

54:21.920 --> 54:22.920
He has no bad behavior

54:22.920 --> 54:24.920
That he is at t equal to 1

54:24.920 --> 54:25.920
After a period of time

54:25.920 --> 54:26.920
His bad behavior

54:26.920 --> 54:27.920
Is it continuous?

54:27.920 --> 54:28.920
Did not happen

54:28.920 --> 54:31.920
Then we have to look at the other two

54:31.920 --> 54:32.920
The difference in value

54:32.920 --> 54:33.920
This is the red one here

54:33.920 --> 54:35.920
Reduce the alignment here

54:35.920 --> 54:37.920
Pink this difference

54:37.920 --> 54:41.920
So we can put the eight questions just now

54:41.920 --> 54:44.920
All of them are drawn as a comparison between two

54:44.920 --> 54:46.920
What is no model?

54:46.920 --> 54:48.920
No model is now

54:48.920 --> 54:51.920
We call it Poisson binomial distribution

54:51.920 --> 54:53.920
It is Poisson binomial

54:53.920 --> 54:54.920
Poisson binomial

54:54.920 --> 54:56.920
It is a binomial

54:56.920 --> 55:00.920
A wide range of binary distributions

55:00.920 --> 55:04.920
That it is every point

55:04.920 --> 55:05.920
Every trial

55:05.920 --> 55:06.920
Every test

55:06.920 --> 55:07.920
Its probability may be different

55:07.920 --> 55:09.920
So we know that the binary distribution

55:09.920 --> 55:10.920
It is every

55:10.920 --> 55:12.920
Distribute its test point

55:12.920 --> 55:13.920
Its probability is the same

55:13.920 --> 55:14.920
But Poisson binomial

55:14.920 --> 55:16.920
It may be different

55:16.920 --> 55:18.920
Then we take this model as our no model

55:18.920 --> 55:20.920
Then we do this bootstrap

55:20.920 --> 55:22.920
Bootstrap means that it is repeated

55:22.920 --> 55:23.920
We may

55:23.920 --> 55:24.920
For this no model

55:24.920 --> 55:27.920
We did this experiment a thousand times

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
Then we look again

55:28.920 --> 55:29.920
What we really observed

55:29.920 --> 55:31.920
The value of M1 to M8 just mentioned

55:31.920 --> 55:34.920
It falls in our thousand repetitions

55:34.920 --> 55:36.920
Did it fall at the end of 5%?

55:36.920 --> 55:37.920
If there is, we will say

55:37.920 --> 55:38.920
Okay, this thing is conspicuous

55:38.920 --> 55:39.920
If not

55:39.920 --> 55:41.920
Just say this thing is not conspicuous

55:41.920 --> 55:43.920
If it falls in the middle of 95%

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
Just not conspicuous

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
Falling at 5%

55:45.920 --> 55:46.920
Whether it is the front or the back

55:46.920 --> 55:48.920
We said it was conspicuous

55:48.920 --> 55:49.920
it is good

55:49.920 --> 55:51.920
So we are based on another

55:51.920 --> 55:52.920
Another village

55:52.920 --> 55:54.920
We do this thing

55:54.920 --> 55:57.920
In the end, we still have some

55:59.920 --> 56:00.920
We have to judge the characteristics

56:00.920 --> 56:02.920
It's very similar to the characteristics just now

56:02.920 --> 56:05.920
It's usually related to suicide prevention

56:05.920 --> 56:07.920
The question is whether he has a suicidal tendency

56:07.920 --> 56:09.920
Then will he help others?

56:09.920 --> 56:11.920
Will he talk about suicide?

56:11.920 --> 56:12.920
Does he have any wine at home?

56:12.920 --> 56:14.920
Do you have any weapons at home?

56:14.920 --> 56:18.920
Then we will follow the eight judgment methods just now

56:19.920 --> 56:20.920
Let's see

56:20.920 --> 56:22.920
They are in the 39 questions just now

56:22.920 --> 56:24.920
Is it clear that the change is good or bad?

56:24.920 --> 56:26.920
The red one is the direction of the change

56:26.920 --> 56:29.920
The blue triangle is in the direction of the change

56:29.920 --> 56:32.920
So some of the effects are external

56:32.920 --> 56:33.920
It's the opposite of the positive

56:33.920 --> 56:35.920
Some of the effects are bad

56:35.920 --> 56:36.920
It's the opposite of the bad direction

56:36.920 --> 56:39.920
So these can be seen from the model just now

56:39.920 --> 56:42.920
Okay, let's sum it up

56:42.920 --> 56:45.920
This is our second project

56:45.920 --> 56:47.920
He wants to look at

56:47.920 --> 56:49.920
A social network

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
In the relationship of the group

56:50.920 --> 56:52.920
We give him an intervention

56:52.920 --> 56:54.920
Then we can measure

56:54.920 --> 56:56.920
This is a sociologist or a epidemiologist

56:56.920 --> 56:59.920
Or some of the public health scientists

56:59.920 --> 57:01.920
The values ​​they care about

57:01.920 --> 57:03.920
Is there any positive behavior?

57:03.920 --> 57:04.920
Is there any positive behavior?

57:04.920 --> 57:05.920
Is there any spread?

57:05.920 --> 57:06.920
We can all give a

57:06.920 --> 57:07.920
Analyze the amount

57:07.920 --> 57:09.920
There is a positive relationship

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
Or no

57:10.920 --> 57:12.920
There is no obvious positive relationship

57:12.920 --> 57:14.920
Then we can see this

57:14.920 --> 57:15.920
Intervention measures

57:15.920 --> 57:17.920
Or the external effect of this public policy

57:17.920 --> 57:18.920
Or

57:18.920 --> 57:19.920
What we care about is

57:19.920 --> 57:21.920
Suicide prevention

57:21.920 --> 57:23.920
Self-protection

57:23.920 --> 57:26.920
The above is my sharing

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
So I just shared

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
Basically three things

57:28.920 --> 57:29.920
The first one is

57:29.920 --> 57:32.920
What I care about during my PhD

57:32.920 --> 57:33.920
Is a complex network

57:33.920 --> 57:34.920
A shared network

57:34.920 --> 57:35.920
The second is

57:35.920 --> 57:37.920
Can we have a third party to take the initiative

57:37.920 --> 57:39.920
To build a

57:39.920 --> 57:41.920
A collective subjective network

57:41.920 --> 57:42.920
The third is

57:42.920 --> 57:44.920
If we are on the Internet

57:44.920 --> 57:45.920
Do an intervention

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
Can we find a way

57:46.920 --> 57:49.920
To measure the effectiveness of this intervention

57:49.920 --> 57:51.920
This is what I'm going to share with you today

57:51.920 --> 57:52.920
Some topics

57:52.920 --> 57:53.920
Thank you all

57:56.920 --> 57:58.920
Thank you for today's speech

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
Then I represent everyone

57:59.920 --> 58:01.920
Let's give it up

58:07.920 --> 58:08.920
That one

58:08.920 --> 58:10.920
Okay, I have some here

58:10.920 --> 58:11.920
I have collected some

58:11.920 --> 58:12.920
When you were talking

58:12.920 --> 58:13.920
When you were talking

58:13.920 --> 58:15.920
Some questions from the audience

58:15.920 --> 58:16.920
Then there are some here

58:16.920 --> 58:17.920
Is about the first study

58:17.920 --> 58:19.920
Some are about the second study

58:19.920 --> 58:20.920
What do you think

58:20.920 --> 58:21.920
I'm talking to you now

58:21.920 --> 58:23.920
How do you think it should be done

58:23.920 --> 58:26.920
Let's start with the first study

58:26.920 --> 58:27.920
Or from

58:27.920 --> 58:28.920
Just turn it over

58:28.920 --> 58:29.920
Start with the second study

58:29.920 --> 58:30.920
See what you want

58:30.920 --> 58:31.920
All right

58:31.920 --> 58:33.920
In fact, we have no preference

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
That's good

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
Once

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
It's just a discussion

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
A study

58:37.920 --> 58:38.920
If it's the first study

58:38.920 --> 58:39.920
Answer together

58:40.920 --> 58:42.920
Which one can start first

58:42.920 --> 58:44.920
Okay, let me start with the first study

58:44.920 --> 58:47.920
Just in the process

58:48.920 --> 58:50.920
I have two questions

58:50.920 --> 58:51.920
But wait

58:51.920 --> 58:52.920
Before I ask

58:52.920 --> 58:54.920
Do you want to ask yourself

58:54.920 --> 58:55.920
Because just now

58:55.920 --> 58:57.920
In fact, if you want to ask yourself

58:57.920 --> 58:59.920
You can also turn on the microphone

58:59.920 --> 59:02.920
Is that plus fish?

59:02.920 --> 59:03.920
C H I A Y U N

59:03.920 --> 59:05.920
And Zhang Yong

59:05.920 --> 59:07.920
Two people have mentioned

59:07.920 --> 59:08.920
Two people have mentioned

59:08.920 --> 59:10.920
About the first study

59:10.920 --> 59:12.920
You can open the microphone

59:12.920 --> 59:13.920
Ask yourself if you want

59:13.920 --> 59:14.920
Or

59:14.920 --> 59:16.920
Or I can ask you

59:18.920 --> 59:20.920
See what you think

59:27.920 --> 59:28.920
So

59:28.920 --> 59:29.920
I don't really understand

59:29.920 --> 59:30.920
So what do you mean

59:30.920 --> 59:32.920
Do you mean to ask me to turn on the microphone now?

59:32.920 --> 59:33.920
Yes, just like this

59:33.920 --> 59:35.920
You can start asking

59:36.920 --> 59:37.920
Ok

59:37.920 --> 59:38.920
Ok, then

59:40.920 --> 59:41.920
Then I will ask first

59:41.920 --> 59:43.920
Although I am actually the second

59:43.920 --> 59:44.920
I am also wrong

59:44.920 --> 59:45.920
Because that

59:45.920 --> 59:47.920
Is it plus fish?

59:47.920 --> 59:48.920
Sorry

59:48.920 --> 59:49.920
I don't know how to spell your name

59:49.920 --> 59:50.920
He should ask first

59:50.920 --> 59:51.920
But anyway

59:51.920 --> 59:52.920
Then I will ask first

59:52.920 --> 59:53.920
Otherwise, I have already opened

59:53.920 --> 59:54.920
Just

59:54.920 --> 59:55.920
You are doing like this

59:55.920 --> 59:56.920
Because basically

59:56.920 --> 59:59.920
You can't draw the whole society

59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920
Then you can only say

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.920
You draw a part of the people

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920
Then go to build

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920
This part of the people

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.920
Give you this network

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920
But

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920
We know that

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.920
When doing network analysis

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
In fact

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.920
Where is the boundary of the entire network

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.920
Then what is its boundary property

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920
Then there is its absolute

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920
Is the absolute dimension

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.920
And the size of the entire network

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.920
In fact, it will affect

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920
Some emergent property

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920
Even your

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.920
Interaction between units

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920
All the same

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
Then what do you think about this thing?

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.920
If you can't draw the whole

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.920
Everyone in the network

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920
Any other questions?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920
Still

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.920
It's a question, right?

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920
Do I answer it once?

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.920
Then I will ask by the way

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.920
Plus fish

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.920
Oh, I'm sorry

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.920
I really don't know your name

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.920
The question seems to be

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920
Because I think it's a bit related

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920
But his question

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.920
More specific

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.920
Then I will ask together

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.920
Then you answer together

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
His question is

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.920
You set positive and negative

01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920
Right? I didn't hear wrong

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920
When study one

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920
The first one

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920
Yes

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920
The question is

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920
Then why don't you use 1 and 0

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920
Is there or not

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.920
Why do you want positive and negative 1

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.920
So this is actually a

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
I think it's an assumption

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.920
So with

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920
Maybe it's a special case

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920
In the question of Zhang Yong

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920
Okay, let's answer it together

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920
Okay, I'm done

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920
it is good

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.920
Thank you for the two questions

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.920
I will answer the question of Yan Yong first

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.920
Is what you just said

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.920
The question of network boundary

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920
Is doing social network

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.920
A big area

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920
Many people are doing

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920
Network Boundary Research

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920
Because

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.920
Network Boundary

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.920
Actually look at your research

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.920
The group of people who care

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.920
Then this thing can be

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.920
Uh, written

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.920
Some things are not written

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920
But like

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.920
The research we are doing

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920
Is written

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920
Is in this village

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920
Because it is between the village and the village

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920
It's just a long distance

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920
He won't have any

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920
Connections between villages

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920
Basically very few

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.920
Then these people are

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.920
Because they are all big

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.920
Ah, these are big

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.920
Then we are in this village

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.920
Maybe 400 people

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.920
Then this boundary is

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.920
Very certain in comparison

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920
Then some research

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.920
Boundary is very uncertain

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.920
Just like

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.920
Suppose my other research is doing

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.920
New York City's population

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.920
New York City's population

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920
Then this is quite uncertain

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.920
That is to say, these people are in New York City

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.920
Uh, have you been to New York City?

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920
Or he wants

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.920
He lives outside New York City

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920
We don't know

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.920
Or this kind of network boundary

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.920
It's hard to define

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.920
But like this research

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920
The network boundary is also very obvious

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.920
Is that I live in this village

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920
Maybe more than 300 people

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920
400 people

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.920
He is our research range

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.920
Then we put everyone

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.920
Get the photo or name

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.920
And then look at this

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920
What should the network look like

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.920
So you just mentioned the problem

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.920
It's not going to happen

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920
On this research

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.920
Then some, uh, network boundary

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.920
It is also a very certain group

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920
He is an organization

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.920
The people inside him may be like

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.920
A department

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.920
He may only accept 120 students

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.920
Then this network boundary is also very close

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.920
It's very, very, very obvious

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:01.920
Just one grade

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.920
Take 120 students

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.920
Or, uh, a company

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.920
He may have 200 employees

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.920
This is also very certain

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.920
Then we are in this kind of very certain network boundary

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.920
To discuss this matter

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.920
His grace is fixed

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920
His grace is his network

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.920
Is fixed

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.920
Then we do this model again

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.920
So there won't be much boundary

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.920
The second question is

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.920
Why don't we use 1 and negative 1 to record

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.920
We don't use 1 and 0 to record

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920
because

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.920
The main problem is that our 0 is also used

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.920
We 0

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920
I didn't make it clear just now

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.920
Our 0 is that he

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920
This relationship is not obvious

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920
What does it mean not to be obvious

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920
Not obvious is that he

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.920
There is a connection that is not obvious

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.920
Or there is no connection that is not obvious

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920
He is

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.920
Uh, it's kind of like we're not sure

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.920
Is there a relationship

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
But 1 and negative 1

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.920
1 is that we are sure that we are very

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.920
We have this relationship

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.920
That negative 1 is that we are sure that this relationship is not

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.920
So we actually used 1 0 and negative 1

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.920
But we just saw in this picture

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.920
Uh, I'm going back to look for it

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.920
In this picture

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.920
In fact, uh, the relationship of 1 is that the relationship of positive is black

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.920
That red relationship is negative 1

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.920
He is red

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.920
As for the others that are not connected

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920
Their relationship is 0

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.920
Because they are us

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920
They are us

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.920
It's not obvious in the statistics

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.920
He is

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.920
We don't

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:26.920
We are not sure he is positive

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920
Or is he

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.920
He is a negative relationship

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:30.920
So 1 0 negative 1

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:31.920
We actually all have

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.920
I just didn't make it clear

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.920
The positive network I just talked about is the network of 1

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.920
The negative network I just talked about is the network of negative 1

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.920
Then these two networks

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920
Sorry

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.920
Did you see my desktop

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920
It's empty

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.920
What I see now is a blue base

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.920
Hey, what about now

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.920
I accidentally jumped out

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.920
Hey, it still looks the same

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.920
I can't go back a little

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.920
I don't know why

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:05.920
If you turn off the share screen and reopen it

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.920
How about this

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.920
Share screen

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920
Stop sharing

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.920
Good

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.920
Then reopen the share screen

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920
Review

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920
Oh yes

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920
Is there

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920
Hey now

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920
Uh, wait a minute

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.920
Oh yes

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920
Good

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920
Sorry

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920
So uh

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.920
Back to the question just now

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.920
We actually have 0

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
I just didn't make it clear

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.920
0 is the relationship between the two

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.920
We are not sure

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.920
The statistics are not sure

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920
Ok

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920
I'll probably answer this

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.920
If there are any further questions

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.920
You can also continue to discuss

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920
That one

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920
Uh

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.920
YUAN

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.920
XIE YUAN

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.920
Hey, Xiao Yuan

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.920
OK

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920
Can you hear me

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920
Can you hear me

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.920
Teacher

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.920
Hey

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920
Hello

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.920
Hi, long time no see

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920
Not long

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920
A few months ago

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920
A few months ago

01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.920
All right

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920
All right

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.920
Everyone at home

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920
Thank you, teacher

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.920
That was a great presentation

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.920
I have a question

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.920
It's about that

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.920
Co-evolution of networks

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.920
Using your tomography method

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920
Because I was thinking

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920
If we want to study

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.920
The co-evolution of networks

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.920
It takes several network snapshots

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.920
If we use this method

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920
Because every time

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.920
Participants may be different

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920
Even if we are the same

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920
Will also lead to

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.920
Its node distribution is different

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920
Because I think the teacher's method

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.920
It seems to be from binomial

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.920
A node distribution evolved

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920
That's what you think

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920
If I use this method

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.920
And then in several stages

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.920
But the number of participants is not the same

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920
That way I can

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.920
Compare several different networks

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.920
Between

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920
Characteristics

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.920
For example, the second stage

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920
Network transitivity

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.920
With the first stage

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.920
Network transitivity

01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.920
Can I do this

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.920
Compare

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920
Do some co-evolution analysis

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920
Or does the teacher think

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920
No, there's no way to compare

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.920
Yes, yes, yes

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920
Thank you

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920
OK

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.920
Thank you, Xiao Yuan

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920
Question is

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.920
Uh, this area is

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920
Uh, I know

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920
I don't know if you've heard of it

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.920
Is multi-layer network

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.920
Multi-layer network is

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.920
In math or physics

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920
Dealing with

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920
This question just now

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920
Like a few waves

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.920
Uh, network

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.920
He gave a few snapshots

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920
Then he wants to see

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.920
His multi-layer can be quite a lot

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920
One is

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920
Uh, every layer of the network

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.920
It's all different

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.920
Look at different variables

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.920
Like this

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.920
Uh

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.920
Maybe it's the same time point

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.920
One layer may be the mood

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920
One layer may be the result

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.920
One layer may be healthy

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920
This

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920
Different layers

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920
The other one is

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920
It evolves over time

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920
That is

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.920
He can be T from 1 to 10

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.920
You give him a live broadcast

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920
Research

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920
Then he will

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920
T equals 1

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920
One layer T equals 2

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920
One layer T equals 10

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920
That

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.920
People who study multi-layer network

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.920
You'll see

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920
What's the relationship between cross-layers

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.920
It's just that

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920
Maybe the members are the same

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920
Some members are the same

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.920
But some members

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.920
Leave or join

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.920
That

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:10.920
In the multi-layer network

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.920
Under the general design

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:12.920
You just mentioned

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920
These problems are all

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.920
Uh, they have

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.920
There are ways to deal with the domain

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.920
Is to leave

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:18.920
Or a new member

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.920
That

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920
I just talked about this model

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.920
I didn't deal with this problem

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.920
Because I actually only have two waves of people

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.920
Then my model is also very simple

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.920
It's just that the network won't change

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920
And then this person

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920
Uh, it's just that the network won't change

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920
That means

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.920
They don't have a new point

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:33.920
There is no point to leave

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.920
Then

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.920
The structure of the network has not changed

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920
So I actually

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.920
There are only a few months in the middle

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.920
I just assume that his network has not changed

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.920
Because we are looking at the relationship network

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.920
That we

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.920
The assumption is that the relationship between two people

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920
In a few months

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.920
Will not change

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920
That

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.920
Of course you can do different extensions

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.920
You can say

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920
Suppose you want to do 10 waves

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.920
That

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.920
Sometimes someone leaves

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.920
Someone comes in

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.920
Then I'm thinking

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.920
You have to use the multi-layer network

01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.920
Structure

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920
In that field

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.920
Mathematicians and physicists also deal with this

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:03.920
The problem you just mentioned

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.920
They have dealt with

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.920
That is, someone leaves

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.920
Someone

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.920
Someone new

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.920
This is all

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920
Um

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.920
Some of the scenarios they have dealt with

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920
So I don't think there will be too many problems

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920
Just look at it

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.920
What is the study of the multi-layer network

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920
How to deal with

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920
Sorry

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.920
Because I

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.920
This model

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.920
There is no such treatment

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.920
But I

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.920
As far as I know, this can be handled

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.920
Can I ask a follow-up?

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:27.920
No problem

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.920
Because

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.920
Multi-layer network

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920
Uh, I'm not very familiar with this part

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.920
But I'm using

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920
Sienna's study

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920
This kind of joiner and lever

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.920
Is a very common way

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.920
That is to say, different waves

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.920
Its members are different

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920
As long as there is an addition

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920
There are

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.920
This is indeed a very common practice

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.920
Just say

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.920
I'm thinking about the teacher's method

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920
A more special way

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920
Because

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.920
Usually when doing joiner and lever

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.920
They

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920
He went to measure the network

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920
That

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920
Uh, the existence of the connection

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920
Usually use the same method

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920
That is to say

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.920
For example, I name my friend

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.920
That part is always

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.920
It's always very fixed

01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.920
But I'm thinking

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920
Teacher

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920
Teacher, your method is to say

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.920
You are through

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.920
Comparison with a node distribution

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.920
Indirectly to deduce

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.920
It's these two nodes

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.920
Does it have a connection?

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.920
Then I was thinking

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.920
That's why this is with

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.920
General

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.920
Uh, the general joiner and lever

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.920
The problem is different

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.920
The reason is

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920
It's right here

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.920
That is to say, it is

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920
Through

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.920
Comparison with a node distribution

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920
Then deduced

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.920
Yeah, but I was thinking

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.920
This

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920
Because it's in

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.920
When different waves of people are different

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.920
This node distribution will change

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920
Correct

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920
So

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.920
Is that right?

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920
Directly above

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.920
Compare

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920
Say different waves

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920
To infer

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920
Oh, these two people

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920
These two people are connected

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920
These two people are not connected

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.920
Mainly want to ask

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.920
This kind of part

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920
Yes

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
Uh, I actually

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.920
Uh, I'm not sure

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.920
What you want to ask is

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.920
My first research is

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.920
Judging from the third party

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.920
Is there any connection?

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.920
Yes yes yes

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.920
The part of the third party

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920
That's right

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.920
That research

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920
It's just one wave

01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.920
That's what I just said

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:00.920
My one

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.920
Uh, participation

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.920
Research

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:03.920
Research time is only one week

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.920
That is to say

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.920
He

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:06.920
He has only one wave

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.920
His settings are only one wave

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.920
That

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.920
Uh, I think

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.920
If you really want to do this

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:12.920
Multi-layer words

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.920
Then you have different waves

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.920
Then come different

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920
Time to test

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.920
Then do this network

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.920
They

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.920
The members of each wave may be different

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.920
But I actually don't know

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.920
Say cross-group

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920
This one

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920
How do i change

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.920
In fact, I just

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:27.920
This first study

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.920
He actually only has one wave

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.920
So he was originally a

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.920
Just

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.920
Under that setting

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.920
He is a complete architecture

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.920
But I didn't think about cross-group

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920
Comparison

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.920
Is the problem of cross-time point comparison

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.920
But

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.920
Um

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.920
You said you

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.920
How will it be done in the relevant research?

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.920
Or do you have any suggestions or questions?

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.920
Actually, I'm not sure

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Because I just

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.920
I thought you were talking about the second one

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:51.920
Because the second one

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.920
I just talked about the second study

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.920
Only

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.920
Only cross

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.920
Comparison

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
But the first study did not

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920
The first study is

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920
I find a time

01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920
A week

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.920
Then make this network

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.920
What I want to compare is

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920
The third party's subjective recognition

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920
With our own

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.920
Objective report

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:07.920
What's the difference

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.920
Um

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.920
Yes, so I didn't think about it

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.920
Do the first study

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920
Cross-group

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920
Maybe it can be

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.920
But

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920
If that's the case

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.920
These people

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:19.920
He will be

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.920
There are in and out

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.920
Then

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920
Cross-group

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.920
How do i cross

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920
Cross-time

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.920
How do I divide

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.920
Will also be a question

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920
Because what I just said

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.920
Divide

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.920
Divide at the same time

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.920
OK

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.920
Understand

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920
Thank you

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.920
No no

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.920
That

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.920
Let me ask a few questions

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920
Because there is

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.920
Just

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920
We are now

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.920
To the second study

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.920
Right

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.920
Natural conversion

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920
So there were some friends just now

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
There are some questions about the second study

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920
Then I

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.920
Uh

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920
I'm here now

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.920
I'm probably summary now

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.920
Then ask

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920
Then if I ask

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.920
What do you think

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.920
I'm the one who asked the question

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:54.920
I think I expressed it wrong

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.920
Then you can turn on the microphone

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920
It doesn't matter

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920
Um

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.920
It's about the second study

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.920
Ah

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:02.920
This Liu

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.920
Asked to say

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920
I'll just read it

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.920
The second case

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920
What is it

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.920
Analyze method

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.920
Analyze intervention

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.920
What about the effect

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.920
This is the first one

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.920
Then

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.920
A little bit related to this question

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920
Is this one

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.920
There should be a surname

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920
Ning

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.920
Ning said

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:18.920
Is there

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.920
Control

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.920
This control group

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.920
Or

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.920
The so-called contrast group

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.920
Because what you are analyzing

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.920
Is the effect of the experimental group

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.920
You can

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.920
You can say that

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920
Then this is

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.920
I think it's the first group

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920
problem

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.920
Ah

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920
The second question is

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.920
Zhang

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:33.920
Is

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:34.920
There will be a lot of groups

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.920
Will there be a lot of groups

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.920
No no no no

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920
In fact, only

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.920
Only the second group

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.920
The second group

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.920
There is one more

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920
It's my own question

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920
But that

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.920
If you don't have time, forget it

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.920
Then there is another one

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920
Zhang Yong

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920
He asked

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920
Because your state

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920
Your notes

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920
The state is 1010

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.920
He said

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.920
He said

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920
Is there a mix state

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.920
Then I'm not sure

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.920
What does he mean

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.920
Then if

01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.920
When you answer later

01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.920
Or he

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:00.920
Uh

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920
He wants to clarify

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.920
You can also say it like this

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.920
Okay, that's it

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920
it is good

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.920
it is good

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.920
Ah

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.920
Thank you for your feedback

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.920
Then I want to talk first

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.920
Is

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920
I think it's better

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.920
Ah

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.920
Good talk

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.920
Is 0

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.920
Like the last question

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.920
Ah

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920
Yan Yong asked this

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920
Mix state question

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920
Because

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.920
010

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920
The simplest thing we do

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.920
One thing

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920
Is binary

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.920
Always better than multi-state

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.920
Do a lot

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.920
So

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920
We only test

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:29.920
Uh

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.920
Binary

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.920
Then

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:32.920
Ah

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:33.920
Let me pour this

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.920
Is

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.920
This is very similar to the first question

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.920
How do we measure

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920
Say

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.920
Does this intervention measure work

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.920
So

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920
Let's look at the changes in bad behavior

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920
Bad behavior is

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.920
Maybe it's

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.920
I asked 39 questions later

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920
Is

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920
Of the 39 questions

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.920
Some of them

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.920
If he answers

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920
Good

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920
Like

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.920
Uh

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.920
Do you have the idea of ​​suicide

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.920
Do you often think of the idea of ​​suicide

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.920
If he says yes

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920
We think it's a bad behavior

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:01.920
It's like smoking

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.920
Is a bad behavior

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.920
That

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.920
The way we record this

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.920
Use 01 to record

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.920
Of course you can be more complicated

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.920
You can even make it

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920
Is a continuous extent

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.920
But for us

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.920
Is 01

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.920
Is

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.920
The first step to do

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.920
If we don't do 01

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920
It will be more difficult later

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.920
So

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.920
We use 01

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.920
This kind of binary

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.920
Binary classification

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.920
To divide this matter

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920
That

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
The way to measure is

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.920
I just said

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.920
We have 39 questions later

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.920
Ah

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.920
Sorry

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.920
There are 39 questions here

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.920
That

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:34.920
Every question

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:35.920
Ah

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920
You can put

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920
Uh

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920
There is bad behavior called 1

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920
Then there is good behavior called 0

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.920
Then we look at this

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.920
At this point in time

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.920
How many changes in 01

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920
You were originally 1

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.920
Later maintained as 1

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.920
It means that

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.920
This person may not have improved

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.920
It's all bad behavior

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.920
At the time of 0

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:52.920
At the first time

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.920
Still bad behavior

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.920
That

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:55.920
If it changes from 1 to 0

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.920
We think there is an improvement

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.920
Under this question

01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.920
He has improved

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.920
He had bad behavior

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.920
Then there was no bad behavior

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920
Then we also see

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920
Suppose a person

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.920
He participated in this intervention

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.920
Then his neighbor

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.920
Is there any way for him to change from 1 to 0

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920
There was originally bad behavior

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920
Later it became no bad behavior

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.920
We want to see the effect of his spread

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.920
So we look at this unit

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.920
Both

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.920
Two of this

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.920
Uh diet

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920
That is

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.920
We

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.920
Of course, you can continue to look at it

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.920
That is to say

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.920
Three layers of diet

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.920
Triplet or triad

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.920
Ah

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.920
Or four layers

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920
But we just care

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920
We are most concerned about

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.920
Can he spread to his direct neighbor

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.920
So we all look at each one

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.920
He is this kind of two pairs of this

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920
Uh

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.920
Connection

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.920
Okay

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.920
Then

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.920
This question is the control group's question

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.920
Actually, uh, we didn't do that

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920
This is

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920
This is of course a

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.920
It should be a pretty big problem

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.920
This reviewer is also asking

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.920
Then we are running directly

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.920
He is

01:16:58.920 --> 01:16:59.920
Two networks

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:00.920
Then the two networks

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.920
We do the same thing

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:03.920
So uh

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.920
In fact, we

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.920
There doesn't seem to be a good way to explain it

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920
But if

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:08.920
Of course I believe

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.920
If it's a good study

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:11.920
He should be

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.920
Bring

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.920
Uh, there are a lot of control variables

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.920
It's just that I might

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.920
Uh, two

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.920
Different villages do the same thing

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920
One is the experiment group

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.920
One is the contrast group

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.920
but

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.920
Uh, our model is more like

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.920
It's a return model

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920
It's us

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.920
My model is bootstrap

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.920
It's a re-draft

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.920
And then look at him

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.920
How much of this deviation from the re-draft

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:34.920
If the deviation is very high

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:35.920
We think this

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.920
Uh, the phenomenon is

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:37.920
Ah, it's obvious

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.920
Or it's obvious

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.920
That

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920
It's just that I have this

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.920
Under the experimental framework

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920
He just didn't do it

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.920
That's when I got the data

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.920
I got the data first

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920
To start modeling

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920
I got the information

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.920
Uh, both villages do the same thing

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.920
Then I report this

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.920
One of the villages is

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.920
His results are better

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:56.920
Then I directly take this village

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.920
The result of the report

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.920
But when we designed it

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.920
It's just that there's no control

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.920
Then we use the model

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.920
It's not a return model

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.920
We can put some variables

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:06.920
Put it in to control

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.920
Just the whole

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.920
The whole structure is not the same

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.920
I hope

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.920
If of course agree

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.920
If there is more control

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.920
Maybe it's better

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.920
But I'm not doing it

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.920
Professional in this area

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.920
It's just that we have this model

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.920
No

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920
I'm sorry

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920
That's about it

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920
Okay

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.920
So do you have any questions for

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920
Is there any question?

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.920
For the first study

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.920
Second study

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.920
Or even a front one

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.920
For your academic history

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.920
Such a question

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.920
Hello Wei

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:43.920
I would like to ask again

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.920
Is the second experiment

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.920
What is the analysis method you use

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.920
This is a more detailed process

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:52.920
Ok

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.920
Um

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:55.920
Ok

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.920
We are first

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.920
Uh

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.920
Then I might have to start from

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.920
I'm thinking about where to start

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.920
What we care about is

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.920
A intervention

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920
Its effect

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.920
Is there any way to extend it to this social network

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.920
Friends in the middle

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.920
Is that you give a person this intervention

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.920
It's this intervention

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.920
Is there any way to spread to a friend

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.920
So we measure

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.920
Is this intervention

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.920
In different directions

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920
Is that we have different directions

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920
That's what I just said

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.920
The 39 questions

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:30.920
Is to commit suicide

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.920
Suicide prevention-related 39 questions

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.920
That every question

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:34.920
We can say

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.920
It has good results

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.920
With no good results

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920
It's like smoking

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.920
Smoking may be bad

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.920
Smoking may be good

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.920
That has this information

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.920
This information is

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.920
Uh, who participated

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.920
We have these people's web map

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.920
These people are

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.920
Uh, we're sure this web map is true

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.920
Then we know that there are some people

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.920
Participate in our preventive research

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920
These intervention measures

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:58.920
Then we also know

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.920
These people are at two points in time

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.920
His state in 39 questions

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.920
Maybe 1 is a bad behavior

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.920
Then 0 is no bad behavior

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.920
So I follow this, uh, information

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.920
I'm going to build a mathematical model

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920
The mathematical model is what we just talked about

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.920
There are six aspects of this, uh, the amount of calculation

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.920
The first two aspects are in this diet

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.920
The relationship between x and y

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.920
Or the relationship between u and v

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920
X or u

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.920
Did he participate in this preventive behavior

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920
Did he participate in this preventive behavior

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920
This is the first two

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.920
What about the last four

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.920
At t equals 0

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.920
This, uh, x and y

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.920
Do they have this bad behavior

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.920
The last two are t equals 1

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920
At this time

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.920
Do u and v have this bad behavior

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.920
So we're going to do these measurements

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.920
It's just that we're going to look at this

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.920
I just talked about this 011101

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.920
He participated in x, y did not participate in x

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.920
Bad behavior

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.920
Bad behavior

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:58.920
Bad behavior

01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.920
At t equals 0

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920
X has no bad behavior

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920
Y has bad behavior

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920
At t equals 1

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.920
Let's see

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.920
Then compare with random

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:05.920
Random how to compare

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.920
Random is that we put these things

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.920
After calculating this value

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.920
And then we look at it as a, uh, here's a

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.920
It's a binomial distribution

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920
It's every experiment

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.920
Its, uh, the probability of production may be different

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.920
Then we can create it

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.920
It's in every grid

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.920
What is its expected value

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.920
What is the expected value

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.920
But we have the actual observed value here

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.920
Because we are at t equals 0

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:33.920
When t equals 1

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.920
There are different observable values

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.920
They took this value

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:37.920
It's called M2, the real value

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:41.920
Compare with a thousand random repeated experiments

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.920
See if it's more obvious or less obvious

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.920
If it's too obvious

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:47.920
We say, okay, this aspect

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.920
It has a positive result

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.920
If it's not obvious

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.920
We say, okay, no, it doesn't have a negative effect

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.920
It doesn't, it has an obvious negative result

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.920
So the final way to present it is

01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.920
39 questions

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920
There are eight aspects of our measurement

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.920
Some of them are good

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.920
You see the red one

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.920
The bigger it is, the more obvious it is

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.920
Some of them are negative

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.920
The bigger it is, the more obvious it is

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.920
So that's about the whole process

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:15.920
I don't know

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.920
I think there's no problem with the statistics

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.920
You explained it very clearly

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.920
But I want to know

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.920
By the time of this page

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.920
How to put these different factors

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.920
Make a

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.920
It's clear in terms of understanding

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.920
Network or something

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.920
It's a kind of narrative

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.920
A description

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.920
Yes, that's good

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:37.920
If that's the case

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.920
We can look at it based on one question

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.920
Then we'll see

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:41.920
I'll just say it here

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.920
Suppose it's the 24th question

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.920
We'll see

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.920
I don't know if you can see my cursor

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.920
I'll look at the 24th question

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:47.920
Q24

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.920
The first one is

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.920
Diffusion of Prevention

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.920
It's a big blue triangle

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.920
It's negative

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.920
That is to say

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.920
If this person participates

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.920
His M1 is a significant negative

01:22:58.920 --> 01:22:59.920
What is M1

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.920
M1 is what I just said

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.920
There are eight indicators here

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:05.920
The M1 indicator

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.920
We'll look at the definition of the M1 indicator

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:08.920
The definition of the M1 indicator is

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.920
You participate in this intervention

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.920
Will it cause

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:14.920
The change in your direct state

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.920
Is from good to bad

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.920
From bad to good

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.920
This is from 1 to 0

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.920
That's under this degree

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.920
This is blue

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.920
So this is a significant negative

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.920
That is to say

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:27.920
He himself

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.920
He can't have this

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.920
From 1 to 0

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.920
The second problem is red

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.920
The second face is red

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.920
M2 is red

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.920
The third and fourth are not significant

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:38.920
The fifth is red

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.920
The others are

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:40.920
Sorry

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.920
24 is the fifth significant

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.920
The sixth is the small negative

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.920
Then the seventh and eighth are not

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.920
The conclusion of the statistical significance

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.920
So we are all based on

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.920
Let's understand the questions one by one

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.920
Let's look at the eight indicators we just talked about

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.920
The eight indicators are different

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.920
Then I am in the article

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.920
We have defined these eight indicators

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.920
What are you measuring

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.920
So the final interpretation is that you see

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:06.920
There are 39 questions

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.920
We measured 39 questions

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.920
Within two waves

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.920
Is there any significant improvement

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.920
Or obvious retreat

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.920
So I don't know if that's the case

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.920
I want to ask

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.920
Because you have 39 indicators

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:22.920
Have you considered doing

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.920
For example, factor analysis

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:28.920
Or a multi-scale analysis

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.920
Let the connectivity between the 39

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.920
A clearer network context

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.920
Actually, I think it's good

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.920
I think we should do it

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.920
Because 39

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.920
We didn't do it

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920
but

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920
I think it's good

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.920
Because of this 39 question

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920
There must be a lot

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.920
There are many repeated

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.920
There are many repeated parts

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.920
That is

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:50.920
But we

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:51.920
We didn't do it on this issue

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.920
We put this question

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.920
These 39 are seen as independent 39

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.920
In fact, the first question will not affect

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.920
To the second question

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:58.920
Will not affect the third question

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.920
You can think of it as 39

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:01.920
Indicators run together

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:02.920
But I agree

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.920
I totally agree

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.920
Say you can do factor analysis

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.920
Or decrease

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.920
These are all possible

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.920
But we haven't done that yet

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.920
OK, thank you

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.920
Thank you

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.920
Thank you all

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.920
Because of time

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.920
We want to say

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.920
This is the last question

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.920
Then I will represent everyone

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.920
Give this warm applause

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:23.920
Very, very exciting

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.920
Thank you all

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.920
Thank you

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.920
Thank you all

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:27.920
Thank you

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.920
OK, OK

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:29.920
Before the end

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.920
This is again

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.920
Business time again

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.920
We are still collecting

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.920
More of this

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.920
The winner of the second half of the year

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:38.920
So if you feel

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:39.920
Your own research

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.920
Or

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.920
Research

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:43.920
This topic can also be

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.920
I want to share with you

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.920
Then let everyone know

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.920
Please do this

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.920
Don't hesitate to share with us

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.920
Then sign up to become a winner

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.920
That's it

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:53.920
Thank you all

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.920
Thank you

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.920
Then I will stop this video now
