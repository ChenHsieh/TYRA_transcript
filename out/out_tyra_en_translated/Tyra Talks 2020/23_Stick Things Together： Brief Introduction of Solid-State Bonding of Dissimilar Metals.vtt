00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Ok, let's start.

00:05.000 --> 00:15.000
Ok, first I need to introduce myself.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Please introduce yourself, thank you.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Ok, I have prepared a few videos.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
I will use them to introduce myself.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Today, I will talk about the simple introduction of metal solvents.

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Zeyu Lin, and I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
First, I will give a brief self-introduction.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
As I mentioned, I am a post-doctoral researcher in Japan.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
My department is the National Research and Development Department of the Institute of Materials and Materials Research.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
My main job here is...

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Sorry, let me use the laser pointer.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
My main job here is to connect the material's microstructure with its mechanical properties,

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
as well as its related performance characteristics.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
At present, I am working on the development of high-strength and high-durability ferrous alloys,

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
as well as the microstructure of permanent magnets,

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
as well as the development of some raw materials.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
Today, I would like to introduce my post-doctoral research...

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
No, I mean my work accumulated during my post-doctoral studies,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
and my post-doctoral research in February this year,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
which is about four years of work.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
The field of research is mainly the solid-state integration of copper,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
which is similar in nature, as well as liquid metal.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
The integration technology used is a technology called ultrasonic integration.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
Its principle is to use high-pressure and high frequency vibration to achieve the deformation of the material to form the node.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
It can be used in steel, high-strength steel, or aluminum alloy, etc.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
It can be used in...

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
The main scene that can be considered is that the composite structure of multi-materials,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
such as the structure of the car body,

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
can achieve the goal characteristics of lightweighting and high strength.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Sorry, I just made a mistake.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
I graduated from Tokyo University of Japan in 2019,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
and majored in material engineering.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
My other major is the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
and the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tsinghua University of China.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
That's all for the main self-introduction.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
Next, I'm going to start introducing today's main speech topic,

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
which is mainly about the integration of solid-state and liquid metal materials that are similar in nature,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
and then use ultrasonic integration to observe the strength of its interface.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
First, I will give a simple background introduction.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
In the engineering background,

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
listeners may be more familiar with the fact that

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
steel is a very solid base.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
It is one of the basic and indispensable materials.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
The picture on the left shows that

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
there are about 15% to 20% of steel in the world every year.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Because there are a lot of steel applications,

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
including architecture, general people, military facilities, transportation, etc.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
It accounts for about 15% to 20% of transportation.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
It is mainly applied to the construction of car parts and the structure of the car body.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
There are a lot of types of steel used,

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
including soft steel, medium-strength, high-strength, and ultra-high-strength steel.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
At present, the development field of materials is mainly focused on

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
how to improve its extensibility and high-strength, etc.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
The picture on the lower left is called DynamoCurve,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
which is a curve distribution like a banana.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Why is there such a distribution?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It is mainly derived from the fact that the strength of the material increases,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
but the extensibility does not decrease.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
Based on the background of traditional physics,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
such strength and extensibility are indispensable.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
However, many scientists are using various methods

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
to try to get out of this field.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
The current research situation is to try to achieve the high strength and high extensibility of both, etc.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Why do we need such a high-strength steel development?

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
It is mainly used when the car body is hit by a heavy object.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
High-strength steel can often provide stronger support

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
to avoid fatal damage to passengers.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
In order to improve safety,

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
the current material development is mainly focused on high-strength and high extensibility, etc.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
What kind of steel is used?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Different strengths of steel are used in different areas of the car body structure.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
This is a simple introduction.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You can clearly see that

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
if the car is hit by a heavy object,

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
the stress and gravity come from the front and back, etc.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
At this time, you need a high-strength structural material

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
to support the entire car body.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
The current high-strength steel developed by traditional physics

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
has reached 780, 980, 1180, etc.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
This represents the strength of steel,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
which is about 550 MPa.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
The current mainstream high-strength steel is

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
concentrated in the front and back of 1000 MPa.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
This is the current situation in which the structural material is used.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
On the other hand,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
if we don't use steel,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
and we use a high-strength material,

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
it will not be able to support the entire car body.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
On the other hand,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
if we don't use steel,

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
and we use a high-strength material,

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
such as aluminum, copper, and carbon fiber, etc.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
If we use this material,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
it can be made very lightweight

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
and has sufficient safety.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
However, the price is also very high.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
As you can see here,

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
for a good car like Audi R8,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
the recommended price in 2020 is about $70,000.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
This price is hard to meet for ordinary people.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
So we mainly use traditional steel

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
and aluminum and carbon fiber.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
In this respect,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
you have to make a choice

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
in terms of cost and mechanical quality.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
The name of the car body structure we often use in our industry

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
is a multi-material structure.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Multi-Material Structure

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
As you can see here,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
in addition to steel,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
it also has a lot of external body parts,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
such as the door, engine cover, etc.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
In order to make it lightweight,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
we usually use aluminum alloy.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
The main maintenance material is aluminum alloy.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
In this respect,

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
when the car body is assembled,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
we mainly use

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
high-strength steel

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
and aluminum alloy.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
In this respect,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
they need to be fixed and processed

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
to form a complete structure.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
It is conceivable that

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
some processes need to be processed

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
to combine them together.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
In recent years,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
in addition to the emission of environmental regulations,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
the demand for lightweighting is increasing.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
On the right side of the slide,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
there is a picture of

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
the materials used in the field of cars

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
in 2030,

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
including aluminum and high-strength steel.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
HSF stands for High Strength Steel.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
The ratio of these two materials

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
will increase from 29% to 57%.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
In the near future,

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
in order to establish high strength

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
and lightweighting,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
we will use more aluminum

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and more high-strength steel.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Therefore, how to combine

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
iron and lightweighting alloy

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
in the manufacturing process

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
is quite important.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Now we will introduce

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
the traditional way

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
of combining materials

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
and manufacturing technology,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
i.e. welding.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Traditionally,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
we define welding

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
as a process

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
in which two separate materials

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
are heated

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
to a high temperature

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
and then combined

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
to produce

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
sufficient quality

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
welding.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
In this process,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
the defects

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
will gradually disappear.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
At such a high temperature,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
along with the change

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
in the structure

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
of the fibers

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
and the growth

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
of the center,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
heat is also affected,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
and so on.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
In this regard,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
the material itself

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
is mechanically affected

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
by the change

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
in the structure

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
of the fibers.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
After the welding point

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
is formed,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
all the fibers

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
around it

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
will undergo

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
huge changes.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Such changes

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
are sometimes not

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
completely positive.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
How to prevent

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
low-performance

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
welding?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
In general,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
if we use

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
a high temperature

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
to melt steel

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and aluminum,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
we will encounter several problems.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
The first is that

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
aluminum and steel

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
have very different melting points.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
The melting point of aluminum

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
is about 600 degrees,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
while steel is about

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
1400 to 1500 degrees.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Therefore,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
at such a high temperature,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
it will produce

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
a huge

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
expansion.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
The expansion

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
will form

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
many compounds

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
between

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
steel and aluminum.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
This compound

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
is not

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
conducive to

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
mechanical performance.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Why?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
The problem is that

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
it is very brittle

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and unbearable to impact.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
After a little impact,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
it will crack

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
like ceramics

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
or glass.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
At the same time,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
it will also

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
produce cracks

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
in the joint

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
between the

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
welding points.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
This is

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
quite disadvantageous to

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
mechanical manufacturing.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
That is to say,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
it is quite disadvantageous

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
to use general

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
combination technology

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
to combine steel and aluminum

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
at high temperature.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
In other words,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
what we may

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
consider next

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
is how to reduce

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
the temperature of the

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
welding point

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
to a certain degree.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
In other words,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
we will focus on

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
how to combine

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
steel and aluminum.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
We need to combine at

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
the melting point of

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
aluminum, which is about

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
660 degrees.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
At this temperature,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
it is called solidification.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Next,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I will briefly introduce

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
solidification.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
As I mentioned earlier,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
it can combine

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
two components

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
and

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
it will not

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
melt during the process.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Its heating is also

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
lower than the melting point of any material.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
We need to introduce

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
more concepts

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
such as sufficient deformation

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
at the material interface.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
At sufficient temperature,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
the interface will expand.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
After the expansion,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
the defect will gradually disappear

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
to achieve

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
the effect of combination.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Here is our main

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
design concept.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
The main concept of solidification

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
is how to make

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
the defect on the interface disappear,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
including holes and

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
cavities, etc.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
At the same time,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
most materials

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
usually have a layer of

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
pollutants on the surface,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
such as carbon

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
and oxygen,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
and other compounds.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
At the same time,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
there will be a certain

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
degree of oxidation film

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
on the surface.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
You may have heard

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
that aluminum

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
is very easy to oxidize.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It forms a layer

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
of oxidizing film

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
on the surface.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
This oxidizing film

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
has a sufficient quality

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
to protect the material

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
from further oxidation.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
This kind of oxidizing film

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
is quite beneficial

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
in combination.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Traditionally, we still

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
have to achieve the contact

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
between the atomic and

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
pure atoms

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
to form an aqueous bond.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
In other words,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
the bond between the

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
atom and the atom

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
or the metal bond,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
etc.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
On the other hand,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
we can say that

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
we have introduced

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
enough deformation

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
at high temperature

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
to make it like clay

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
to stir and form a

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
interlocking interface structure.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
OK.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Here,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
we will

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
make a brief introduction

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
about solid-state integration.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Traditionally,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
the first way of integration

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
is called expansion integration.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
The main principle is to use

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
high pressure and high temperature

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
to apply on two objects

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
that need to be integrated.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
With such high temperature and high pressure,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
sufficient time can form

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
a bond.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
This way of integration

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
can be applied on

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
metal or ceramic

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
or metal or even

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
carbon fiber.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
But the problem is that

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
the integration time is quite long

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
and requires a higher temperature.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
At the same time,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
if the interface passes

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
a high temperature and a long time,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
it will form an

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
overly complex structure,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
including metal-based objects,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
which we mentioned earlier,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
forming a layer

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
like ceramic,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
a non-extensible middle layer.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
This middle layer

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
has a very weak mechanical nature

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and is not conducive to the overall integration strength.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
On the other hand,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
the other

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
is friction-mixing integration.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
The principle is

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
to use a high-speed

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
rotation

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
weld head

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
directly on the surface

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
to form a high temperature.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
After the high temperature,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
the material will gradually soften,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
but it is not yet at the melting point.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
So it will be like

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
clay.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
After it softens,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
this weld head can be pressed down

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
and then start to move.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Then move along

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
the seam between the two.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Let the defect of the interface

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
gradually pass through

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and move and soften.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
But on the other hand,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
this material

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
can be used in all kinds of

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
aluminum alloy, aluminum-ferrous alloy,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
etc. Its application range is quite wide.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
For example,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
let's take the

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Japanese alloy as an example.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
It mainly uses

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
this type of

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
alloying technology

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
for the

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
combination of

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
interfaces.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
On the other hand,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
its shortcomings are

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
that it takes a long time to

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
combine.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
At the same time,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
on the other hand,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
the time it takes to combine

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
also takes a long time to

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
combine.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
This may be due to the

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
shortcomings of the interface

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
and the shape of the

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
intermetallic alloy.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
based on this

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
background,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
based on this research background,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
we use another type of

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
alloying technology.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
This is called ultrasonic welding.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
The principle of ultrasonic welding

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
may be mentioned earlier.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It is a certain degree of pressure

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
on the two overlapping

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
bows.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It is about

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
15,000 to 24,000

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
degrees of vibration.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Then the interface is friction-heated.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
In this state,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
the interface will

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
deform unilaterally.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
After deformation,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
it will form a fiber structure

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
that forms a ring.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
This causes the surface

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
interface to disappear

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
and the welding point to form.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
In this respect,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
we believe that

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
it can be used in

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
the future.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Because it does not

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
follow the fusion,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
it will not produce a large amount of

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
intermetallic alloys that are

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
not conducive to mechanical strength.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Therefore, it is expected to be

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
used in the future.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It can be used in

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
car lightweighting

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
and high-strength composite

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
structure materials manufacturing,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
etc.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Its advantages include

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
lower

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
fusion temperature

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
compared to

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
normal welding.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
At the same time,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
its interface friction

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
heat is formed in a

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
relatively small area.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
The friction heat

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
formed in the small area

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
is relatively small

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
for the overall

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
fiber structure change.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
In this way,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
under the strength

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
of the material itself

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and the machine itself,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
it can be fully combined

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
to produce a relatively small

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
fiber structure change.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
This is quite beneficial

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
to the overall manufacturing.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
On the other hand,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
the picture on the

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
bottom right is the

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
application of the current

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
superfine wave fusion

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
on the machine-made

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
rolling wheel.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
In the rolling wheel,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
it is the high-speed vibration

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
of the water and the

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
friction heat of the interface

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
is formed and the

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
water is transformed

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
into a fusion

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
to carry out

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
the machine-made

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
process.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
The superfine wave

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
fusion itself is not

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
a relatively new technology.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It was first used in the

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
1960s.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
At first, the main application

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
scene was the

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
printing circuit board

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
and the wiring of

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
various chips.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It is a technology

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
often used in

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
circuit board manufacturing.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
It also uses

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
pressure and vibration

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
to complete the

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
fusion on the machine board.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
It is a process

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
of pressure and vibration.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Combining the main principles,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
we can make a

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
more detailed introduction.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Traditionally,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
there may be hundreds to thousands

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
of newtons of pressure.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
After pressing,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
the two bows

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
will be welded

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and the base will be fixed.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
High-speed vibration will begin

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
to form.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
The vibration is usually

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
about 20 to 60 micrometers

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
per second,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
which is about

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
15,000 to 24,000

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
per second.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
In such a short and

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
dense vibration,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
the interface will

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
generate a lot of deformation

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
and a lot of friction heat

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
will appear.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Friction heat and deformation

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
combine to form the interface.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
In this process,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
the interface

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
will undergo high-speed

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
deformation.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
After the deformation,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
different phenomena such as

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
heat and expansion

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
will appear.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Therefore, in so many

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
interfaces,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
the interface formation mechanism

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
is quite difficult to

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
understand,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
especially in the case of

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
soft metal materials.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
In the case of harder materials,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
such as steel and

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
carbon,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
it is quite rare

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
to study the formation

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
of the interface mechanism

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
in the scene.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Therefore,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
our main research

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
is on the hard materials.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Assuming that

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
we are now

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
progressing to how to

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
use superfine fiber

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
in the application of hard materials,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
mainly in some

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
advanced research,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
most of the superfine fiber

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
is used in aluminum alloy

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
or plastic alloy,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
which is a soft material.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The interface will form

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
a different degree of friction flow,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
that is, after it reaches a high temperature,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
it will constantly

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
deform and squeeze.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
The deformation and squeezing process

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
causes a lot of changes

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
in the fiber structure of the interface.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
However,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
such a situation will not

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
appear in the human position

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
on the hard material.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
If you want to combine

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
superfine fiber

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
on a steel

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
with a higher strength,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
steel, iron, and

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
aluminum alloy,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
this part needs to be further explored.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
On the other hand,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
if it is used in hard materials,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
the combination of steel and aluminum

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
has been done

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
a lot of advanced research

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
in the superfine fiber combination.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
They are mainly concentrated

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
in a short time,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
within a few seconds,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
they can form

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
about 30 minutes

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
in the expansion combination

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
of superfine fiber

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and intermetallics.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Such a combination

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
is not conducive

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
to the mechanical properties

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
mentioned earlier.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Most of the research

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
focuses on this later stage

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
of superfine fiber

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
formation.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
On the other hand,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
in the early days,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
the material was friction

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and deformed after friction.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
How will the formation

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
of intermetallics

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
evolve?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
This mechanism

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
is relatively rare.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
However, this part is also true.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The application of superfine fiber

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
in the combination of steel

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
and aluminum has a significant

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
impact.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
We mainly

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
understand

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
how to use superfine fiber

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
in the superfine fiber

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
combination

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
situation.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
This is divided into two parts.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
The first one

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
will be divided into

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
the phenomenon of

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
no interface reaction

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
when combined.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
On the other hand,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
we will use another type of

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
metal combination

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
to discuss

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
how to combine

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
superfine fiber

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
in the superfine fiber

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
combination situation.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
The first part

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
is to understand

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
how to combine

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
superfine fiber

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
in the superfine fiber

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
combination situation.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
We will use steel and aluminum.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Why do we use steel and aluminum?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
The main purpose is that

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
there is no interface reaction

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
between the two,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
so it is difficult

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
to analyze the interface.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
As a comparison,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
we use steel and aluminum to combine.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
On the other hand,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
from the previous principle introduction,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
it can be known that

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
only high-speed friction

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
will cause interface contact.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The depth of the contact point

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
and the roughness of the material surface

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
have a significant impact.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
This research

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
is not enough.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
On the other hand,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
one part of the research

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
also focuses on the roughness of the surface

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and the impact on the strength of the combination.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
On the other hand,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
because we have to use steel

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
and other materials to combine,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
the mechanical performance of steel

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
such as hardness and strength

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
and other changes

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
will also affect the nature of the combination.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Therefore, the hardness of the iron itself

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and the different microstructures

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
will also have an impact

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
On the other hand,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
this part is the combination of hard materials

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
such as steel and aluminum, steel and titanium, etc.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Why choose these two combinations?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Mainly because the two

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
aluminum and titanium have different

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
deformation capabilities at high temperatures.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Therefore, when we plan to explore

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
the origin of the combination,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
what impact

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
these two different materials

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
and their deformation capabilities

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
have on the combination of the two?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Because of time,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
we will directly enter the

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
experimental step.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
First of all, it is the combination of steel and aluminum

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
to form the interface.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
The material we use

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
is a non-metallic atomic steel,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
which is a relatively soft

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
medium-strength steel

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and a pure aluminum plate

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
as a research subject.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
On the surface,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
we will use

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
a mirror-surfacer

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
to measure the roughness

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
of the surface.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Next,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
we use a superfine grain

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
to make a superfine grain

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
combination.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
The main combination condition

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
is that we use a pressure

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
of about 2000 newtons,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
which is applied to

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
about 10 times the

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
power of the steel head,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
which is accompanied by

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
about 20,000 times of vibration

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
. The combination time

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
is about 0.01 seconds

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
to 2.0 seconds.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
After completing the

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
superfine grain combination,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
the next step is to

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
stretch the time to judge the

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
strength of the combination.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
After the stretching is broken,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
suppose that it is broken on the interface,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
we will observe the electronic

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
microscope and

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
analyze the microstructure.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
On the other hand,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
if it is not suitable for

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
stretching time, we will prepare

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
another batch of samples that have not yet been stretched.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
After the

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
two halves are cut in half,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
the surface is exposed

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
and the

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
electronic microscope

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and the back image electronic

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
3D EBSD are observed

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
to observe the image

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
and the

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
deformation of the interface.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
First of

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
all, suppose the

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
steel head is used,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
made of steel and iron,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
and the iron plate using

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
superfine media

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
on the interface can

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
be seen for the

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
angle of integration,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
the combination time

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
against the middle is

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
stressed.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Its crystal here

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
is about

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
2,000 newtons,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
which is enough

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
to break the

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
IF steel,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
that is, the

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
infinite-sphere atomic steel itself.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
It is greater than the strength of the steel itself.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
On the other hand,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
if we compare it with other

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
integrations,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
such as the expansion integration

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
using iron and iron,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
it requires a relatively long

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
time, which is about 50 seconds,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
and requires a certain degree of

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
high temperature.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
In this case,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
if we compare it with the

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
microstructure of the interface,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
its interface deformation

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
is quite concentrated,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
about only 10 micrometers

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
before and after.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
On the other hand,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
if we compare it with the

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
friction-mixing-combination FSW,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
its deformation is greater,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
about 15 to 20

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
micrometers.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
At the same time, it is accompanied by a very severe deformation.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Such severe deformation

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
is reliable to the welding point itself.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
That is to say,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
its durability is

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
also a subject to

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
consider.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Therefore,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
the superfine-mixing-combination

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
can be done in a short time

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
without a lot of deformation

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
to complete the

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
superfine-mixing-combination.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
On the other hand,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
if it is used on

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
the interface of iron and iron

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
and iron and nickel,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
this part

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
is that we did

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
electronic microscope

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
and EBSD analysis

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
and found that the

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
formation of the interface

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
will form such a

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
small friction particle.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
This friction particle will gradually increase

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and at the same time be accompanied by friction

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
to friction the upper and lower

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
nickel and iron body.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
After enough time

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
and temperature, it will

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
gradually be compressed.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
After the compression,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
it will produce severe deformation

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and spread to the entire

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
interface to complete

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
the formation of the interface.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
At the same time,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
it is accompanied by

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
this

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
seam,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
the seam and

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
the segment.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
If

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
there is enough time,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
it is

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
superfine-mixing-combination

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
can form enough

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
partial and

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
severe shrinkage deformation.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
It can be completed in a short time.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
On the other hand,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
superfine-mixing-combination

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
is the surface.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
On the other hand,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
if we use a thicker

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
seam, the time of

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
combining will be shorter.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
The time of shrinkage will be longer.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Why does it get longer?

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
If it is a thick seam,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
it will form a thicker

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
and larger

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
seam, such as

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
seam seam and seam seam.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
In this way,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
how do I compress

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
these three peaks and three valleys?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It takes a longer time and

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
pressure to compress it

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
to form the interface and

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
form the friction force

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
to form more combining time.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Therefore,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
a slightly smoother

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
combination interface

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
does not have any

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
pollutants or oxidants

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
at the same time.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
What about the type of steel itself?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Assuming that it is replaced,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
because what we mentioned earlier

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
is that it uses

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
relatively

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
average fiber structure

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
ferrite

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
IF steel.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Next, we will use

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
polyester

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
and ferrite

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
neutral carbon steel

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
and 14% nickel steel.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
There is also 0.08%

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
low carbon steel.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Their hardness and

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
microstructure, we will make a

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
more detailed

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
comparison.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
This part is the

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
ferrite itself.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
In addition to the

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
IF steel used at the beginning,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
we also prepared different types of steel.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Here,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
ferrite, porcelain steel, and

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
martensite steel have different hardness.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
As the hardness increases,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
the combination strength

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
is getting lower and lower.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Compared to the beginning,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
nickel and IF steel only need

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
2 seconds to combine.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
On the other hand,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
neutral carbon steel, including

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
ferrite and ferrite,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
takes about 5 seconds to

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
combine.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
On the other hand,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
once the hardness is higher,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
about 200 to 300 hardness

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
martensite steel,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
it takes longer to combine.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Why do we have

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
different situations?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
We analyzed the interface

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
and found that

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
for the same steel photo,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
the bottom is

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
porcelain steel, the bottom left is

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
porcelain steel, and the bottom right is ferrite.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Ferrite and nickel will form

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
more friction resistance.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
This friction resistance has a larger

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
coefficient of friction resistance.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
On the other hand,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
ferrite and nickel

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
have relatively low deformation.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
At the same time,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
there are still

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
interface defects.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
That is to say,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
in a harder steel,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
it takes a long time to

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
complete the combination.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
At the same time,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
we can get

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
a conclusion that

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
ferrite and nickel have

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
relatively similar hardness.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
On the other hand,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
ferrite and nickel have

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
relatively similar hardness.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
It can provide more

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
deformation.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Such large-scale deformation

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
is conducive to the rise of

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
the combination strength.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
This part is

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
the friction

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
generated by the

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
combination.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
There are different mechanisms.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
The main difference is

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
the friction between

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
ferrite and nickel.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
The main difference between the two

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
is that the interface

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
on the ferrite and nickel

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
will form

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
something like a friction resistance.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
On the other hand,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
if it is nickel,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
in the case of nickel,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
the harder material

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
will be

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
deformed

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
in the ferrite material

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
and form a friction resistance.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
In other words,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
such a situation

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
occurs when the hardness

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
gap is relatively large,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
such as ferrite and nickel.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
In other words,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
the first part of our

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
conclusion can be concentrated

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
in the appearance of

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
friction resistance particles

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
with a relatively large

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
friction resistance.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
On the other hand,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
if it is ferrite and nickel,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
the friction loss

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
in the ferrite itself

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
will take longer

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
to eliminate

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
such interface defects

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
to complete the

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
combined formation.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
The second part

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
is the

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
combination strength.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
In other words,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
in the case of a reaction,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
the combined interface

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
is formed.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
As mentioned earlier,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
we skip this part.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
In other words,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
at the initial stage,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
before the bonding structure

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
is formed,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
how does the combined interface

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
develop?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
This is the part

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
to be discussed.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
First of all,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
in the case of ferrite and nickel,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
we use the

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
traditionally mentioned

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
IF steel and 5000-gram aluminum alloy.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Then we

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
do superimposed bonding.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
In the process of bonding,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
we will stick a thermocouple

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
on the interface to measure

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the temperature of the bonding structure.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
The picture on the right shows

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
the change in strength and time.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
It can be clearly seen that

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
before 0.5 seconds,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
the combined strength was very weak

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
and could not be measured.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
After 1 second,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
the combined strength rose rapidly

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
to 2.5 seconds,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
and the bonding was completed.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
At the same time,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
it gradually decreased

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
due to the serious deformation

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
of the aluminum itself,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
resulting in the fracture

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
in the aluminum.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Why is there such a change?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
We can see that

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
if we

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
combine the temperature changes

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
here,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
it rises very rapidly

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
at the initial temperature,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
and it can reach

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
about 400 degrees in about 1 second.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Here, we have

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
compared it with the previous study,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
and found that the temperature obtained

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
in 1 second is about 400 degrees.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Once it exceeds 400 degrees,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
the aluminum itself

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
will shrink

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and its deformable ability

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
will increase rapidly,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
which is enough to

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
remove the defect of the interface

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and combine it.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
On the other hand,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
we used the electronic microscope

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
to observe its interface

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
and found that as time went by,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
it was indeed about 1.1 seconds

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
that the interface became sticky

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and the defect was concentrated in the aluminum.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
As time went by,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
the interface was gradually completed,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
and the defect on this side of the aluminum

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
gradually disappeared,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
and it took 2.5 seconds

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
to complete a fully integrated interface.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
As time went by,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
the interface became

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
more and more sticky.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Therefore,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
we can categorize

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
the whole phenomenon here.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
At the beginning of the integration,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
the factor of

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
the strength being too low

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
caused the aluminum to be friction,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and it will break off from the aluminum

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and attach to the iron side

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
and the IF steel side.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
As time goes by,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
the aluminum itself

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
has enough deformable ability at high temperature,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
it will gradually be compressed

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and the defect can

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
gradually disappear to complete the integration.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
OK.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
The other part

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
is the combination of iron and titanium.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
The reason why we

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
use titanium

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
is that the deformation ability of

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
titanium itself at high temperature

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
is not as obvious as aluminum.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
On the other hand,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
some basic

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
physics concepts

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
may know that titanium is a hexagon.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
If the hexagon is deformed

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
and subjected to friction,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
it will have a lot of defects,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
so it is a metal

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
that has relatively little extension ability.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
In this way,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
the superhexagon

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
can be found

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
under the similar conditions

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
mentioned earlier.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Before 2 seconds,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
the strength of the integration

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
gradually reaches a platform,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
which is a stable state.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
But after 2 seconds,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
the strength of the integration

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
has increased dramatically

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
during 2 seconds to 2.5 seconds.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Why does this happen?

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
At first,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
we think that

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
after 2 seconds,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
we will find that

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
once it exceeds 600 degrees,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
it may produce

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
the hexagon of iron and titanium

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
on the left.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
On the hexagon,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
you can see that

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
there is a lower point of contact here.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
At this point of contact,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
it will be found that

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
once the iron has a certain degree of

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
about 15 to 20%

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
, it will produce the hexagon.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
That is to say,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
from the original HCP type

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
to the BCC type,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
BCC's beta type.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
BCC's deformation ability

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
is that

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
the deformation ability of the

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
BCC is better than

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
the HCP of the hexagon

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
and the most dense hexagon.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
In the next step,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
in order to verify

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
our assumption,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
we observed the interface

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
and found that

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
at about 2.0 seconds,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
the interface will

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
break off

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
on the side of the

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
machine itself and stick

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
to the side of the iron.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
After 2 seconds,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
up to 2.5 seconds,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
the interface's

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
original gap

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
will disappear

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
and become

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
a hole.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
As time goes by,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
these holes will gradually disappear.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
So,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
up to 3 seconds

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
can complete the interface.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Compared to the expansion

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
interface mentioned earlier,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
it usually takes

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
about 1 to 2 hours

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
to complete the interface

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
of iron and iron type.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
On the other hand,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
if you use a transverse interface,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
you will find that

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
after about 2.0 seconds,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
it will appear again and again.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Why does this happen?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
As mentioned earlier,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
the initial interface

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
is still an alpha type

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
of the hexagon machine at 2.0 seconds.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
On the other hand,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
as time increases to 2.5 seconds,

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
it will form

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
such a BCC

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
structure beta type

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
when the temperature

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
is high enough

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
to make the gap

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
disappear.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Therefore,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
we can conclude that

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
BCC type has the

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
power to

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
combine the interface.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Therefore,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
the summary of the second part

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
of the interface

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
is mainly here.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Here you can see that

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
it only takes about 450 degrees

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
On the other hand,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
if you use iron and type,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
type takes longer.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Why? Because it needs

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
a temperature of more than 600 degrees

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
with the expansion of iron

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
to complete the interface.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
The method of completing the interface

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
is to convert type from the

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
original alpha to beta type.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Therefore, the last part

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
is the summary of this speech.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Here we mainly

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
talk about the first part.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
In the similar hard material

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
combination, we will find

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
such a BCC.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
BCC can provide greater

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
partial deformation,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
and at the same time,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
the combination can be completed

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
in about 2 seconds.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
On the other hand,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
if you use a harder material

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
such as porcelain, iron,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
or martensite,

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
it will damage the internal structure

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
and cause such a defect to disappear.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
On the other hand,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
a smoother combination is

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
conducive to integration.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
At the same time,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
if you use a more

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
similar hard material,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
it is also conducive to

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
the increase in the intensity of the integration.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
On the other hand,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
if it is a hard material,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
we must consider

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
the enough deformation ability

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
to introduce deformation.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
These are the interesting points

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
that have been discovered

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
so far.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
In this speech,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
we have mentioned

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
that in the combination,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
we will produce rapid and large-scale deformations,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
and there will also be

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
contact friction damage,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
or metal decomposition,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
and image transformation, etc.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
What we have learned

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
is that in the future,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
we expect to apply

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
the multi-component composite material

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
to structure manufacturing

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
or further 3D metal decomposition.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
OK

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That's the main part of

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
today's speech.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Thank you.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Thank you.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
It's a very interesting speech.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Now it's Q&A time.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
We can ask

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
because there are

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
two questions

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
in the chat box.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
We can ask Kunyan

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
to use

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
your microphone

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
to ask your questions.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
OK

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
The first question is

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
how do you measure the temperature and heat

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
of your composite?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Traditionally, I use

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
thermal electric heating.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
If you can see me,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I'm welding at the edge of the material.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Wait a minute.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I use this method

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
to weld at the edge of the material itself.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
At the edge,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
it is subjected to direct pressure

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
from the welding head.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Under the pressure,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
it can be guaranteed that

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
although the combined temperature

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
is the middle one,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
the heat of the metal interface

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
will disappear immediately

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
after the welding is over?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Will it disappear immediately?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Or will it remain the same?

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Under its condition,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
the thermal profile

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
can be seen.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
That is,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
after the combined time

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
is over,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
it will be about 1000 degrees

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
per second.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Why is it so fast?

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Because once the welding is over,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
it is touched

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
by the welding head

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and the base.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
This kind of contact will make

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
the heat dissipation very fast.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Yes, I understand.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
One more question.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
You just mentioned

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
that

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
the combination of

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
alpha and theta

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
changes to beta and theta.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
But if your cooling speed

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
is so fast,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
is your interface

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
pure beta titanium

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
or will it produce martensite?

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
In fact,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
this picture at 3.0 seconds

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
actually forms

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
a martensite structure.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
It is a Weissmannian structure.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
It is formed by alpha and beta

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
passing through.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Under extreme cold conditions,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
it forms a martensite structure

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
like this.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
On the other hand,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
why doesn't it

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
form such a transition structure?

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Mainly because iron

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
also expands at high temperatures.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
After expanding to the side of theta,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
we actually analyzed it.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
We found that there is about

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
5-10% iron in it.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
This iron

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
is a beta-theta stabilizer.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This was also mentioned

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
in the preliminary study.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
OK.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Thank you.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Can we ask

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Y.H. Guo

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
to explain your question?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
OK.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I'm more of an application person.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Can you hear me?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I can hear you.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I'm more of an application person.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
But there are also people in my lab

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
working on materials.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
So I understand

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
that it may be a practical

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
application issue.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
First of all,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I mentioned the AM part.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I'm more curious about

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
the AM part.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Is it locked in any application?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
For the AM application,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
we are working on

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
lightweight...

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Traditionally...

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
In the preliminary study,

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
they didn't mention

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
the AM part in detail.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But the possibility

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
is that

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
the AM application

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
is made

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
from super-thin-waves

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
combined with

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
aluminum alloy

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
and copper.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
After forming

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
such a composite structure,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
it will be cut.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
In this way,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
the super-thin-waves

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
will be cut.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
It's like

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
creating a composite structure.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Yes.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
In the end,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
it will be cut.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
But in this way,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
the material consumption

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
will not be as much as

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
traditional CNC cutting.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
OK.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
And...

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
In your conclusion,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
you mentioned

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
the super-thin-waves.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I'm more curious about

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
how thin it should be

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
to be good enough.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Because it will affect

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
the smoothness of the

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
manufacturing process.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Yes.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
For the super-thin-waves,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
we want to provide

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
a very flat surface.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Because it's flat,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
once two blades

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
are pressed together,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the contact point of the interface

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
is not enough.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Here, I use

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
a relatively flat surface.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
The RASA is about

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
0.1 microns.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
OK.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
0.1 microns.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Yes.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
But this is the result of

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
oxidized aluminum powder.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
We didn't do it for a long time.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
About 10 to 20 seconds.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
The surface is really smooth.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
OK.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
And...

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
You mentioned that

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
aluminum and iron

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
don't mix.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Is that right?

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Yes.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I understand.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Yes.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Aluminum and iron

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
don't mix.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Aluminum and iron

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
don't mix.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Aluminum and iron

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
are oxidized.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Aluminum and iron

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
meet.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Aluminum and iron

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
are oxidized.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Aluminum and iron

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
are oxidized.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Aluminum and iron

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
are oxidized.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Aluminum and iron

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
are oxidized.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Aluminum and iron

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
are oxidized.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Aluminum and iron

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
are oxidized.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Aluminum and iron

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
are oxidized.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Aluminum and iron

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
are oxidized.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Aluminum and iron

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
are oxidized.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Aluminum and iron

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
are oxidized.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Aluminum and iron

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
are oxidized.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Ningnew

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
are oxidized.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Sorry,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I have a question.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I made a video

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
with

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Laser Metal 3D

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Laser Metal 3D

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
When they were scanning

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
the metal powder,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
it was a bit like melting.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
They used a welding machine.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I'm curious.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
When I made that video,

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
you mentioned that

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
there are oxidization problems.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Will aluminum oxidize

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
in your research?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Will aluminum oxidize

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
in your research?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
In fact,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
in most cases,

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
aluminum oxidizes

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
after grinding.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
We will measure the thickness of the oxidizing film.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
The thickness of the oxidizing film

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
may be less than 100 nanometers.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
It doesn't affect

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
our research.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
You can see that

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
we focus on

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
SEM.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
SEM is a few microns ahead and behind.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
In this case, we didn't see

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
any obvious oxidization.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
About oxidization research,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
there are a lot of advanced research.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
They use a small-density analysis method.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
So this method

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
doesn't need to be done in a non-oxidized environment.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
In fact, it doesn't need to be done in a non-oxidized environment.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Why?

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Because after high-temperature bonding,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
it doesn't affect

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
the atmosphere

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
in the middle of the bonding point.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Therefore,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
when we cut it in half

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
and look at the interface analysis,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
we found that there was no obvious oxidization.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
OK.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
If there is, it's all micro-density.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
It has to go to PPM,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
such as using atomic carbon

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
OK.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Got it.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Thank you.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Thank you.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Can we ask Matt Sly

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
to ask you a question?

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Hello.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Thank you for

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
your wonderful speech.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I have three questions.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
First, you said that

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
IMC has an impact on strength.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I want to know

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
how to define

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
its impact on strength.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Since IMC can form bonding,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
its strength should be stronger.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Why is its strength

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
not good?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Yes.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Regarding the strength of IMC,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
we have established it

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
in a more basic concept.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Traditionally,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
thick IMCs

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
usually form a large amount of IMCs

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
at high temperatures.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
A large amount of IMCs

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
has a negative effect.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
On the other hand,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
if we

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
control the bonding conditions

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
precisely,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
it can form

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
a more detailed IMC image.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
On the other hand,

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
it has a better impact

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
on the bonding strength.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
This diagram

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
shows that

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
IMC thickness

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
has an impact on bonding strength.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
However,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
if it is too thick,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
its bonding strength will decrease.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I see.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
The second question is

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
you just mentioned

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
the roughness.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Basically,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
the whole technology

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
requires some roughness

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
on the surface.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
When you have high temperatures,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
it can melt the surface

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
at the same time.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
You also mentioned

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
the better the surface,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
the better the bonding strength.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Is there a

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
roughness limit?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The roughness limit

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
is based on

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
the smoothness

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
of the surface.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
For example,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
if we use 1 micrometer

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
of oxidized aluminum

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
to measure the surface,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
we can see that

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
the surface is smooth

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
and the surface surface is smooth.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
However,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
if we use a

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
thicker surface

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
to measure the surface,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
the contact point

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
will be reduced.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
The less contact points,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
the less bonding strength.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
The more contact points,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
the better bonding strength.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
On the other hand,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
as you mentioned before,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
there should be contact points.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
If the surface is smooth

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and there are no contact points,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
there will be no friction.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Theoretically,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
it is possible.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
However,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
in terms of

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
our current technology,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
it is OK

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
if the surface is smooth to a certain extent.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
However,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
this is what we can imagine.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Thank you.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
My last question is

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
that you said that

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
it should be applied

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
to the frame of the car.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Basically,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
the frame of the car

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
is three-dimensional,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and the experiment

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
you do here is

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
two-dimensional.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
In the future,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
will it be possible

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
to make a car frame

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that is three-dimensional

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
with three-dimensional

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
car frame?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Because in the future,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
there will be no

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
three-dimensional car frame.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
We don't know

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
whether the car can be

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
made in three-dimensional.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
We don't know

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
if it can be

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
made in three-dimensional.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
In other words,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
it can be applied

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
to some points

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
in the three-dimensional

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
structure of the car body.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It is mainly

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
the connection between

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
the engine cover,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and the structure of

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
the car body.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It is relatively difficult

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
to combine large areas of

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
supercardioid combination

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
as of now.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Can we ask Mr. Huang

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
to ask you a question?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Yes.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Can I ask a question?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Sure.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I have two or three questions.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The first one is

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
that what you are doing now

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
is basically based on

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
a balanced project.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I have a curious question.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
How do you control

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
whether it produces IMC

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
or solid solution?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It mainly depends on

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the combination of

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
the two materials.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
In the beginning,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
our judgment was based on

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
a two-dimensional picture.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
In addition,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
let's take this picture as an example.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It is enough for us to increase

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
to about 5,600 degrees.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
With some expansion,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
we can get

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
such a BCC structure.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
On the other hand,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
if the BCC is too high,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
but the expansion also increases,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
the amount of expansion also increases,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
it may form another aspect,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
such as IMC, solid solution,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
or solid-solid solution, etc.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
In other words,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
the control of the

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
product itself

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
mainly depends on

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
the conditions of interface reaction,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
such as temperature, time, etc.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It's hard to judge.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The second question is

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
because both are

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
single elements,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
if the other side is

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
BCC,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
or some special

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
metal-solid solution,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
is it possible that

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
it will produce some

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
unequal attacks during the manufacturing process?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
In this case, will it affect

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
the interface?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Or will it not affect the interface

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
during the process?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
The temperature of the BCC

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
may be higher than the temperature of the BCC.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Yes,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
if it's a low-temperature material,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
it's true that it can be

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
liquefied.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
For example,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
the new solution

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
is only 400 degrees Celsius.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
If it's more than 400 degrees Celsius,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
the temperature of the BCC

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
will exceed the temperature of the solution.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
In this case,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
you have to consider

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
whether the strength of the BCC

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
has a positive effect on the interface.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
If it's a negative effect,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
you may choose to skip

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
the application of this material.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
The previous question

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
is about multi-elements,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
such as BCC

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
or metal-solid solution.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Is it possible

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
that it will produce some unequal attacks?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
It's possible.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Because it's a short-term solution,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
it will produce some

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
unequal attacks.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It's possible that

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
the overall analysis will be difficult.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Generally speaking,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
if there is an interface issue,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
it may not be a good thing for bonding.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yes,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
why is it not necessarily a good thing?

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Because once the interface

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
has an issue,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
it will slowly go back to the temperature.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
The cooling effect

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
will change the volume.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Most of the time,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
you will see that

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
there are many unequal holes

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
under the temperature.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
These holes are usually not conducive

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
to the strength of the interface.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I see.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
The last question is about the interface.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
You will produce this IMC.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So, in your opinion,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
this IMC is the main cause

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
of the linear deformation.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Is that right?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Linear motion.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Is your IMC

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
generated later or linear motion?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It still supports linear motion.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Because it's harder,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
it will lead to linear deformation.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Generally speaking,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
it is generated

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
after the surrounding

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
linear deformation ability

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
is better.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Then, it may be formed

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
by the interface as the integration point.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Sometimes,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
you will find that

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
the IMC will be erased.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It is brittle.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
It can't improve the ability

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
of linear deformation

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
on the whole.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So, it has no auxiliary function.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Yes.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So, it is quite hard.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
It is generated

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
from the expansion layer

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
and the manufacturing process.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It's like this.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
It's possible.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Let's take this picture as an example.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Let's say it reaches 500°C.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
At the end of the friction,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
the temperature may drop.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Although it's a short time,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
it may be generated

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
in this situation.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
But we don't have the so-called

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
zero tower observation.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
So, it's hard to be sure

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
whether the IMC is generated

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
here or at the end.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Is there any specificity of the IMC

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
or is it random?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
The specificity depends on

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
the material itself.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Some are obvious,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
some are not.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
For example,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
it's not obvious

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
because it's too small.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's beyond EBSD's

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
detection limit.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I see.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
It's quite interesting.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Thank you.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Thank you.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Any other questions?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
No more questions?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
If they have any questions,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
they can send an email to you.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Okay.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
It's the same email.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
The traditional email.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Okay.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Thank you for your

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
wonderful presentation.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Thank you for coming

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
to explain your research.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
It's very interesting.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You're welcome.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
That's all

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
for today's presentation.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
If you

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
haven't

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
joined

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Taira's team,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
you can

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
fill in the form.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
I will

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
stop the recording

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
now.
