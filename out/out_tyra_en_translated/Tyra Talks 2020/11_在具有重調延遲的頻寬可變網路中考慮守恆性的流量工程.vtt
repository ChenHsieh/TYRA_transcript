00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tarot Talk. I am the host today, Zhang Yanyong.

00:08.000 --> 00:18.000
We are very honored to invite Dr. Zeng Sihao, a colleague at my school, to tell us about the topic of his research on the Internet today.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
His research focuses on the parallel and variable traffic engineering of re-adjusting latency.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Let me introduce Dr. Sihao.

00:32.000 --> 00:41.000
Dr. Sihao majored in Electrical Engineering at NTU.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
He then went to Cornell to study ECE, Electrical Engineering.

00:47.000 --> 00:56.000
He then came to Caltech to study Computer and Mathematical Science.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
He then studied Engineering and Applied Science.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
Let's give the floor to Dr. Sihao.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Thank you, Yanyong, for the introduction.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
This topic is actually a bit long and difficult to understand.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
However, when Yanyong invited me to give a talk, I thought that since it is a talk,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
why not talk about a topic that is actually related to my research?

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
So I took the ICMP paper that I submitted last year.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Today I will try to make it as simple as possible.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Although this topic looks very difficult, you don't have to worry too much.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
Its English title is Perseverance-Aware Traffic Engineering in Rate-Adaptive Networks with Reconfiguration Delay.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
So I just translated the English title into Chinese.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
As for what each term means, we will see later.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
If you have any questions in the middle, please feel free to interrupt me at any time and ask me questions.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
In addition, Caltech has a special system called Computing and Mathematical Science.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
This system is actually under Engineering.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Although C stands for Engineering, the department seems to be under it.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
It seems that the relationship between division and department is not quite the same,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
but it is actually not very important.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
So why do we want to study this topic?

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
My research topic is mainly about the Internet.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
What is the Internet? The Internet is actually a bunch of things connected together.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Why do we want to connect a bunch of things together?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Basically, we want to communicate with each other.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
We send some things, some information from one end of the Internet,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
and we hope to get this information on the other end.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Or we want to send some goods, such as a logistics network.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
For example, we want to transport fruits from Chiayi to Taipei.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
This is also a network.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
In fact, most of my research is on the Internet of information,

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
that is, the Internet of communication between some electronic products or electronic devices using electronic signals.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
How are these networks usually transmitted?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
That is to say, how is this information transmitted on the Internet?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Usually, for example, we will have our own personal equipment.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
For example, today's lecture is the same.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
We may use a computer or a tablet or a mobile phone.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
We will connect to the Internet.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
What does it mean to connect to the Internet?

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
In fact, we are sending a piece of information to a place called an exchanger, a router.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Sometimes this router also has a wireless exchanger,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
such as AP, Access Point.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
This is for wireless networks.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Sometimes you will also use a base station to receive these things.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
After these terminals receive the message,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
they will send it through an exchanger to a space.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Then we will be on the other side of the space.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Maybe someone else uses another device to get this information.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
This is basically how the whole network works.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
In this case,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
because we use an exchanger to connect a lot of different devices,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
we may put our information into an exchanger

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
and then go to another place to get something else.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
In order to get a specific thing,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
we have to establish a point-to-point connection with it.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
This is actually quite important.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
In the early days, the Internet was a bit like a telephone line.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
At that time, there was a connection god.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
When the two of us wanted to communicate,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
there must be a line in the middle to communicate with us.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But today, the Internet is not necessary.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Today, the Internet actually sends a lot of different traffic

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
in various ways, using this kind of exchanger,

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
one by one to our target destination.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
These terminals can be various things.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
For example, you can be a so-called cloud terminal,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
a server at the far end.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Or when we play games with others,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
we may have a server.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
We may also receive messages from others.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
For example, the 5G network, which is very popular recently,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
is actually talking about the communication at the wireless terminal.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
Obviously, no matter how we get the information at the far end,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
we have to go through these exchangers in the middle

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
or through the network in the middle

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
to help us pass the information from one end to the other.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
So even if we have 5G now,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
5G means that

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
5G is very fast from our wireless device to our base station.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
But after it gets to the base station,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
no matter what you do,

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
you still have to go through the network in the middle to help you.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
So this network is the main focus of my network research.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
This is called the broadband network.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Broadband network means that

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
there is a great distance between the two terminals.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Relatively speaking, if we are only in a local area,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
this is called LAN,

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
which stands for Local Area Network.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Actually, I don't know how to say it in Chinese,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
but it's a local network.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
So what's the problem with broadband networks?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Because these broadband networks are connected to very far places,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
we know that

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
when we use telecommunications to send things,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
electricity is actually very easy to consume.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
So how do we send them?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
We have to use a very special kind of wire.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
We definitely can't use the kind of wire that we usually use to plug breadboards.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
We must use a very special kind of wire to send.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So how do we send these things?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We will send them from one terminal to the other.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
There must be a very special wire in the middle.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
This actually requires cost.

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
But this cost is sometimes justifiable.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
It can be accepted.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
If the service I want to provide can make me earn more money,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
then of course I am willing to spend a lot of money

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
to build this kind of expensive link.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You can think of it as these lines in the middle

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
to connect to two very far places.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
For example, many big companies do this.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
For example, Microsoft or Google.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Because they usually provide some cloud services.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
For example, you may sometimes use

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Google Sheets, Google Gmail,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
or Microsoft Hotmail,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
like this kind of thing,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
or all kinds of different services,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
such as YouTube.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
They just store the data all over the world.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
They will let you get the data very quickly.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
For example, they will build their own broadband network.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
What are the benefits of this?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
If you have this broadband network,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I can effectively adjust

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
how I want to use these lines.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
If I can effectively use these lines,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I have a better chance of reducing my costs

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
and making more money.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Basically like this.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
So now most companies

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
are investing a lot in building their own network.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Instead of purely using some more traditional Internet.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
For example, we may sign a contract with AT&T

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
or we sign a contract with Taiwan Cable.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
They actually provide the network,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
but the network is not under the control of these companies.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Sometimes you can't adjust

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
how to use your connection in the middle.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
So these big companies usually

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
will build their own network,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
and then they will operate these networks themselves

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
to achieve higher performance.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
We just mentioned that

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
the network is so far away.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
These lines in the middle are actually quite special.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
What kind of lines are these lines?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
They are not ordinary blue lines.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Of course there are ordinary blue lines,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
but the amount of blue lines that can be passed is limited.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
And it's more expensive.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So most of the time we use

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
cheaper blue lines with higher economic value.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
This is actually not a blue line.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
This is a blue line that uses optical technology

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
to transmit signals through this light wire.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
This light wire is actually cheaper.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And then there is a lot of information that can be transmitted by the light wire.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Because you use light.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Compared to electrical signals,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
you have all kinds of different frequencies.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
It can also be used.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
And the speed of light is also quite fast.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
It doesn't need to use electronic signals

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
to receive it first and then transmit it.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
They just enhance the strength of light

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
and then continue to transmit.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So it actually has a lot of benefits.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
That is to say,

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
most of these big companies

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
will use some light wires

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
to transmit signals far away,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
and then turn it into electrical signals

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
at the end point.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Then we communicate with electrical signals.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
These light wires are actually

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
better than ordinary blue lines.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
That is to say, it has a higher economic value.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
But how do you say on this broadband network,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
no matter how cheap it is,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
you have to pull a few hundred kilometers,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
it will be expensive right away.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So no matter,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
and you are in maintenance,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
or in operation,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
it's actually not cheap.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So these light wires on the broadband network

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
are actually a kind of expensive equipment.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Usually we don't want to say

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
that our light wires can't be used.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
What does it mean not to be used?

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
That is to say, light wires are actually usable.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
That is to say,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
my signal can go through this light wire.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
That is to say, after I go through this light wire,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I can get my signal.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Let's use a simple example here.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
How do we send a signal

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
from one end to the other?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
You can imagine that

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
we are on both ends of the light wire.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
We can actually send it,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
we can send it at its frequency.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
If we think of a white paper,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
we can draw a dot on the white paper.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Then we put this paper through the light wire.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
The light wire will pass this paper to the other side.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Then I look at this paper.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Ah, what is your signal?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
If the other person can interpret your signal,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
that means your signal has been successfully passed.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
So let's use this simple example to see.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Suppose I have a big white paper now.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I can send this white paper to the other side.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Then I can tell the other person

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
a similar code.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Say, if you see me

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
put a dot on the left, it's 0.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Put a dot on the right, it's 1.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
In this case,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
we can use this code to send information.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
As long as you have 0 and 1,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
you can generate a lot of different information

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
in this sequence.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
The problem is,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
this actually sounds pretty good.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Then we keep sending this.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
For example, my left, right,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
right, left, left, right, right.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Then we can quickly send out the signal.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Isn't that great?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
But what is reality?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Reality is that all signals follow the message.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
That is to say, everyone is sending something.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
In the past, it was not so beautiful

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
in the middle of the opposite.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
In the middle, there must be some

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
battery signal or light signal interference.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Let's take a simple example today.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Suppose we have a message.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
It will draw this thing on the paper.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
For example, I draw this dot.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Shake it left and right.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
When we get to the other side,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
we look like

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
For example, I received a signal of shake.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
For example, like this.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It's a little bit off.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
But it's still roughly on the left.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
So in the middle of this case,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
we can say that this is still zero.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I probably know it's zero.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Anyway, although there is a little bit of noise,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
but it's roughly the signal on the left.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
So I know it's zero from my code.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Then it is possible that noise

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
may also put your signal

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
a little bit in a different direction.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
In this case,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
you are probably also quite confident that

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
this signal is actually on the left.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
So it's zero.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
But if I give you a signal like this today,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Is it on the left or on the right?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It seems to be a little bit on the left

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
and a little bit on the right, right?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
So it's not easy to judge.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
If we draw a line,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
that is to say,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
we separate the original left and right

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
and draw the line out a little bit.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It's actually still on the left.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
So I know this signal

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
is probably still zero.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
But sometimes it's just not so lucky.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
For example, this noise is actually very big.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
It pushed my signal to the very right.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
How do you know

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
it's zero or one at this time?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Then we might say

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
your original signal is one.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
But in fact,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
the original signal I sent was zero.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
So in this situation,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
my signal is actually

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
unable to successfully send to the opposite side.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
That is to say,

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
in this case,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
if the noise is very big,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I can't actually successfully

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
send the message I want to send

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
through the light to the opposite side.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So in this case,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
we can say that

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
this light can't be used.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Because you can't successfully

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
send the signal to the opposite side.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Let's use an example to see

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
if this kind of situation

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
is actually very rare,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
then it doesn't matter.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
For example, I might have

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
a million times, ten million times,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
a hundred million times,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I only happen to have

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
a very unfortunate

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
case of my signal being intercepted.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Then I just throw it away.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I might just ask the other side

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
to re-send it again or something.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
There's probably no problem.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
If we take these two,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
for example,

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I either send zero

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
or send one,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
the signal that is disturbed by the noise

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
will be drawn out to take a look.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
For example,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
it might look like this.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
That is to say,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
if I send zero,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
we use red to show

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
the situation when I send zero.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
After sending zero,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
it may be disturbed by the noise.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
The signal I see

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
at the receiving end

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
may look like this,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
scattered everywhere.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Similarly,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
if I originally send one,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
it is the green signal one

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
that I originally sent,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
it may also be disturbed by the noise

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and scatter like this.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
But even in this situation,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
although we can see

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that some signals

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
may be misjudged,

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
but generally speaking,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
most of the signals

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
are still distinguishable.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
In this situation,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
this light wire

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
can still be used

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
because most of the signals

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
are actually fine.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
There is no problem in judgment.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
But if today's situation

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
is like this,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
in today's situation,

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
the noise

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
scatters my signal

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
to such an extent

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
that most of the red

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
and green signals

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
are actually mixed together.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
In this case,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
it is easy for me to make a misjudgment.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Even if I send one at the beginning,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I may have a big chance

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
to be judged as zero.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Even if I send zero,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I have a lot of chances

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
to be judged as one.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
In this situation,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
it is difficult for you

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
to say that

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
you can't use this light wire

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
because its noise

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
is far greater than

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
the signal energy of your signal.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
In this situation,

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
we have to separate

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
these two

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
original zeros and ones.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
If we separate them,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
we have a chance

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
to be judged as one.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
At that time,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
you will consume

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
more energy.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Or,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
in this situation,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
you may reach

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
the level of energy

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
your machine can send

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
every time

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
you lower the width

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
of the white paper.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Then you may say

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
that this thing cannot be used.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
So this is the signal

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
that will be affected

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
by the intensity

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
of the noise signal

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
to cause

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
whether this light wire

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
can be used

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
or not.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Of course,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
sometimes it is

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
a more unfortunate situation.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
But,

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
in fact,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
sometimes we are

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
very lucky.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Because when we

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
operate the light wire,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
we usually

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
separate these two signals

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
very widely.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
This is the so-called

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
conservative operation.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
In this situation,

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
there are not so many

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
noise signals.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Even if there are noise signals,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
we will see that

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
these two groups

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
are actually

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
quite widely separated.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
That is to say,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
if I give you

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
zero at the beginning,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
then I will

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
probably

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
have no problem

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
to easily

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
determine that

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
this is zero.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Similarly,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
I can easily

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
know that

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
the group on the right

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
is probably one.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
In this situation,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
in fact,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
we will now say

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
that this light wire

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
can be used.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
It's really good.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
But in fact,

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
at the same time,

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
we can find that

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
there are still a lot of blanks here.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
In fact,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
we can

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
make this white paper

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
more efficient.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
What should we do?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
We not only give zero,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
but we can also

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
give some other...

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
We can also

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
subdivide this

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
white paper

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
into four equal parts.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Let's say

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
if I see

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
this dot on the far left,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
then I actually

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
want to tell you that it's zero.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I want to

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
say one zero

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
on the far right.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Similarly,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
we can see

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
these dots in the middle.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I just say zero one.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
If this signal

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
is actually not

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
disturbed by noise,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
then in fact,

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
we can still

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
successfully

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
receive these signals.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Because

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
these signals

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
are still

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
roughly in

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
their original positions.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Since they are

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
roughly in

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
their original positions,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
we can still

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
easily judge that

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
if I see

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
a signal here today,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
then I probably know

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
that there is no problem.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Its original signal

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
is actually

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
zero.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Its original signal

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
is zero.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Like this.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
So,

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
at the same time,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
how many signals

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
can we send

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
with a piece of white paper?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
It's not just

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
related to

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
the size of this piece of white paper.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
It's also related

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
to the noise

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
it receives.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
So this is

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
the so-called

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
noise ratio,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
SNR.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
So,

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
the bigger my piece of white paper is,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
the more

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I can send

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
messages.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
At the same time,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I can not only say

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
zero or one,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I can also say

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
zero zero,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
zero one,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
one zero one.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
That means

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
the messages I can send

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
at the same time

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
are more.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
The more,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
that means

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
my frequency is higher.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
What about SNR?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Of course,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
at the same time,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
if you have a lot of noise,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
then you can

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
do less things.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Because although

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
your piece of white paper is big,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
at the same time,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
the amount of messages

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
you can receive

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
is not that much.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
The messages you can successfully

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
see on the other side

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
are not that much.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Now,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
if we consider

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
the transmission of

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
signals,

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
it's like this.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
If we want to

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
send a signal

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
from the left

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
to the right

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
via a light

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
to the right,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
we can think that

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
our signal

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
is a bit like

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
a piece of white paper.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Then we

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
decide

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
the code

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
between each other.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
For example,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
if I see on the left,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
this is zero zero,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
zero zero,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
zero one,

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
one one,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
one one zero,

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
like this,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
this is called

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
modulation.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Modulation

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
means

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
adjusting

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
the relationship

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
between

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
your changes

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
and your

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
signal.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
What is this

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
modulation?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
If the other side

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
also knows

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
this modulation,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
after you send

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
the signal,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
the other side

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
can interpret

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
your signal.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
It's a bit like

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
if I say

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
the leftmost point

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
is zero zero,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
zero zero,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
like this.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Then we can

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
send the signal

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
from one side

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
of the light

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
to the other side.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Of course,

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
it's not that good.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
If there is no

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
modulation interference,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
of course it's good.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
In fact,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
we can

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
put a lot of points,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
but because of

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
the modulation,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
like the example

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
we just saw,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
because of the modulation,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
so we actually

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
see the signal

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
at the receiving end

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
here,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
the signal

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
is a bit

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
not the original position,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
it may be a little bit

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
off,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
but if it's not

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
off a lot,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
we can still

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
successfully know

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
what the original

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
signal looks like.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
If you see

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
the signal is probably

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
in this area,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
then we know

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
it was originally

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
this point.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Then we can

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
check our meter

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
and say

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
this is zero zero.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
After this,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
we can actually

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
not need

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
these colors

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
to mark them,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
right?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
That is to say,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
what is my

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
modulation?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
How do I

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
divide this white paper

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
into several

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
different areas

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
and then I use

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
each point

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
to represent

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
a signal.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
If I say

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
there is not

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
much noise

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
on the other side,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I can say

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
it's probably

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
in this area

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
and it corresponds

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
to this point.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
This point

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
represents a signal.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
So this is

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
what we

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
generally call

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
constellation,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
that is,

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
if I see

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
this point,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
what is

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
the signal?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Usually,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
at the receiving end,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
we will

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
make a judgment

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
based on

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
the message

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
to see

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
which signal

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
is more similar

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
to the original one.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Then we will

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
interpret the

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
original signal.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
So we can

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
also see that

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
this noise

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
actually

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
depends on

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
the strength of

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
the noise

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
is related to

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
the frequency of

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
our signal.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Sometimes we

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
say

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
why we can

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
say

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
we buy a line today

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
and we say

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
its frequency is

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
10 GB

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
or we say

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
it is 100 GB.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
In fact,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
the frequency of

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
this line

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
is related to

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
noise.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
The reason is

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
because

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
we generally

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
operate these lines

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
in a conservative way.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
For example,

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
these lines

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
may have

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
expected

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
noise

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
in the natural world

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
which is

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
something like

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
this.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Then we will

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
give a very strong

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
signal

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
to separate it.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
In this way,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
we can

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
ensure that

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
we can

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
always

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
restore

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
the

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
original

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
signal.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Then we say

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
this line

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
probably has

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
capacity.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
In fact,

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
when we actually

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
send a signal,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
we are not

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
only

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
a blank sheet.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
We are not

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
only one-dimensional.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Sometimes we

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
use multiple dimensions

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
or in this case

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
we use two-dimensional

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
to show.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
For example,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
I have a

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
two-dimensional signal

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
and we will

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
also be

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
disturbed by

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
noise.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
These signals

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
scatter

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
and we

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
can see that

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
the degree of

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
scattering is

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
not much.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
So we can

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
still clearly

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
tell if

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
this signal

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
is in this area

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
and its

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
original signal

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
is here.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
So it

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
can still

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
successfully

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
pull our

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
signal from

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
one side

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
to the other.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
The advantage of

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
two-dimensional,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
three-dimensional

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
or multiple dimensions

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
is that

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
we can

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
expand this

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
blank sheet

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
so we

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
can see that

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
the width of

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
this line

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
is actually

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
the ratio

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
of the signal

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
to its

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
noise.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
The noise

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
ratio

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
has a

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
very strong

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
relationship.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Generally speaking,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
most of

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
the time,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
as we

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
just said,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
although

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
this line

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
is 50

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Gbps,

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
which is

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
50 x

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
10

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
9

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
square

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
bits,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
we can

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
still

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
clearly

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
tell

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
if

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
this

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
noise

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
is

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
in

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
this area

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
and

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
its

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
original

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
signal

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
is here

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
and

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
its

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
noise

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
ratio

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
is here.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
So

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
this

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
noise

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
ratio

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
is

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
about

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
this much.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
So

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
we can

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
clearly

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
tell

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
if

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
this

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
noise

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
is

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
in

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
this

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
area

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
and

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
its

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
original

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
signal

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
is here

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
and

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
its

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
original

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
noise

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
ratio

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
is here

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
and

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
its

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
original

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
signal

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
is here

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
and

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
its

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
original

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
signal

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
is here.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
So

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I can

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
modify

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
the

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
modulation

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
code.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
If I

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
modify

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
the

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
modulation,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I can

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
send more

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
messages

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
to the

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
other side

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
at the

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
same time.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
So

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
this

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
effectively

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
improves

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
my frequency.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
So

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
even though

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
we still

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
receive the

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
same

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
signal,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
I can

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
still

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
modify

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
the

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
modulation

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
code.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
So

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I can

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
modify

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
the

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
modulation

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
code

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
and

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
send

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
more

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
messages

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
to the

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
other side

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
at the

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
same

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
time.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
So

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I can

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
modify

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
the

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
modulation

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
code

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
and

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
send

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
more

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
messages

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
to the

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
other side

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
at the

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
same

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
time.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
So

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
I can

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
modify

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
the

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
modulation

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
code

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
and

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
send

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
more

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000

same

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
So

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I can

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
modify

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
So

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I can

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
modify

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
So

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
I can

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I can

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
modify

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
the

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
modulation

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
code

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
and

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
send

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
more

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
messages

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
to the

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
other side

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
at the

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
same

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
time.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
So

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
I can

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
modify

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
the

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
modulation

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
code

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
and

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
send

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
more

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
messages

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
to the

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
other side

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
at the

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
same

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
time.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
So

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I can

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
modify

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
the

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
modulation

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
code

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
and

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
send

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
more

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
messages

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
to the

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
other side

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
at the

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
same

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
time.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
So

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I can

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
modify

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
the

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
modulation

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
code

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
and

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
send

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
more

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
messages

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
to the

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
other side

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
at the

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
same

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
time.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
So

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
I can

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
modify

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
the

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
modulation

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
code

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
and

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
send

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
more

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
messages

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
to the

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
other side

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
at the

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
same

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
time.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
So

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
if

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
we have

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
the

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
light source

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
now,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
we can

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
modify

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
the

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
code

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
to

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
increase

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
the

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
frequency.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
But

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
the

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
signal

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
can't

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
be

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
very

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
noisy.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
So

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
this is

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
the

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
architecture

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
that

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Microsoft

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
has

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
proposed.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Or

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
there

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
is a

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
drawback.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
It's not a

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
drawback.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
It's a

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
trade-off.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Yes,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
what we

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
just said

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
was

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
great.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
If

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
we

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
can

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
use

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
different

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
constellation

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
maps

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
to

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
achieve

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
better

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
frequency.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
But

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
the

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
problem is

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
that

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
you

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
need to

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
reconfigure

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
the

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
map

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
to

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
achieve

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
good

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
frequency.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
If

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
you

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
have

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
a

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
new

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
map,

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
you

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
need to

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
reconfigure

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
it.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
You

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
need to

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
reconfigure

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
it.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
So

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
need to

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
reconfigure

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
it.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
So

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
we

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
need to

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
reconfigure

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
the

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
map

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
to

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
achieve

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
good

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
frequency.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
So

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
need to

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
reconfigure

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
it.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
So

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
I

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
need to

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
reconfigure

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
it.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
So

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
I

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
need to

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
reconfigure

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
it.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
So

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
I

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
need to

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
reconfigure

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
it.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
So

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
I

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
need to

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
reconfigure

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
it.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
So

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
if we

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
suddenly

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
reconfigure

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
the

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
map,

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
the

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
map

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
will

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
suddenly

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
break.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
The

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
broken

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
map

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
will

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
cause

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
the

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
traffic

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
disturbance

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
caused

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
by

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
the

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
network

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
sending

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
signals to

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
the

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
network.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
So

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
the

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
traffic

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
will

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
be

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
disrupted

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
or

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
thrown away.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
So

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
the

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
users

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
will

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
protest.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
For

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
example,

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
if you

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
call

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
the

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
network

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
to

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
slow

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
down

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
or

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
break

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
the

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
network,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
it

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
will

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
cause

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
the

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
network

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
to

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
slow

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
down

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
or

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
break

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
the

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
network.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
So

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
the

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
traffic

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
will

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
be

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
disrupted

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
or

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
thrown away.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
So

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
the

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
traffic

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
will

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
be

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
disrupted

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
or

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
broken.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
So

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
the

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
traffic

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
will

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
be

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
disrupted

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
or

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
broken.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
So

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
the

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
network

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
will

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
be

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
disrupted

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
or

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
broken.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
The

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
traffic

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
will

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
be

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
broken or

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
broken.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
The

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
traffic

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
will

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
be

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
disrupted

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
or

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
broken.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
So

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
the

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
traffic

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
will

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
be

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
disrupted

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
or

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
broken

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
or

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
damaged

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
or

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
so.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
So

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
the

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
traffic

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
will

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
be

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
disrupted

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
or

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
broken.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
So

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
the

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
traffic

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
will

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
be

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
disrupted

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
or

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
damaged

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
or

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
so.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
So

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
the

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
network

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
will

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
be

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
disrupted

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
or

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
broken

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
or

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
damaged

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
or

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
damaged

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
or

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
damaged

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
or

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
other

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
traffic

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
will

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
be

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
disrupted

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
or

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
broken

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
or

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
damaged

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
or

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
damaged

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
or

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
damaged

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
or

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
****

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
disrupted

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
or

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
trashed

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
or

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
controlled

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
traffic

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
by

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
walking

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
or

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
biking

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
or

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
traveling

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
by

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
running

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
or

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
traveling

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
express

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
The traffic may be slightly affected by the movement of the network,

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
but it is not directly affected by the movement of the network.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
This is similar to

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
what the paper said

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
in the past.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
If we want to

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
change the

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
traffic,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
we should change the concept in stages.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
This is the update of the multi-step.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
So,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
we can see the difference.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
If we use the original proposal,

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
which is to cut it off directly,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
and then restore it,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
we may cause a huge

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
churn.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
But if we have several steps now,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
what should we do?

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
What should we do

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
in each step?

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
This is what we want to do.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
In this paper,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
what kind of update

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
do we want to do?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
In fact,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I try not to interfere with

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
so much

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
network traffic

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
in each step.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
This sounds quite intuitive.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
If I can

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
get to my

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
final destination today,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
and in each step,

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
I will not

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
let my

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
original network traffic

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
be cut off.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
It may only lose a little,

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
but not too much.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
For me,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
the less loss,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
the better.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
If the best situation is that

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I do not lose any traffic at all,

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I can get to the end.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But because you have to adjust,

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
you have to

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
have some lines that cannot be used.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
So, you will definitely lose a little,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
but you do not lose too much.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
This should be

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
a conceptually

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
better

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
adjustment plan.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
The concept of

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
not losing too much

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
is called perseverance.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Perseverance

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
is the so-called

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
consistency.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
That is,

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
this traffic,

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
originally,

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
for example,

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
if it is 1,

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
it can be conservative.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
It can not

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
lose much.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Its loss

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
may be less than

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
how much.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
We call it

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
perseverance level.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Of course,

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
we hope that

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
this perseverance level

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
is

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
the higher,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
the better.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Perseverance

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
is originally

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
1.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
How much

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
do I need

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
for the rest?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
For example,

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
0.9,

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
0.8,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
like this.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Like this.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
So,

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
what is

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
our final

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
plan?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Our plan

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
becomes that

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
we want to

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
get to the end

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
as soon as possible,

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
but we do not want

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
to lose too much

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
traffic

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
in each step

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
in the middle.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
It becomes that

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
we look for

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
the so-called

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
perseverance way,

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
which is

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
to consider

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
the consistency of

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
traffic engineering.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
The consistency of

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
traffic engineering

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
means that

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
we want to

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
get to the end

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
as soon as possible,

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
but we do not want to

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
lose too much

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
traffic

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
in each step

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
in the middle.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
This is

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
what we

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
proposed

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
in the middle

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
of this paper.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
We want to

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
do this

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
new proposal.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
We think

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
this is

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
actually better

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
than the

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
original

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
churn-based

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
proposal.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Why?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Because

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
in the churn-based

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
proposal,

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
you cut off

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
most of the

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
traffic,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
so you will

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
get a

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
very serious

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
network interference.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
This is

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
actually the

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
so-called

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
perseverance level

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
zero.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Between

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
the two

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
steps,

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
what can

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
I lose the most?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
I can lose

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
all my traffic.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
All traffic

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
can be cut off,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
which is

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
perseverance level

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
zero.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
However,

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
if we

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
keep a

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
higher

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
perseverance level,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
for example,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
0.5,

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
there are

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
two middle

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
steps in

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
the update

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
plan.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
In each

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
plan,

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
I lose

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
at most

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
half of the

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
traffic.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
For example,

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
if my

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
traffic was

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
from the

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
left to the

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
right,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
all my

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
lines were

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
used up.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
In the first

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
step,

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
I pulled

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
the traffic

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
from the

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
top line

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
down

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
and cut

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
them

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
off.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
In this way,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
I keep

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
at least

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
half of

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
my

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
traffic.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
In the

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
entire

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
update process,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Can you

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
go back

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
to the

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
last page?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Yes,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
it's in the

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
last page.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
It's in the

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
last page.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
There are

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
several pages

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
in the

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
last page.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
This one?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Yes.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
It's a bit

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
laggy.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Yes,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
this page.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
I don't know

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
if this is

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
practical.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
For example,

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
you show

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
a step,

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
the first

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
version,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
and then you

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
propose

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
unstep.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
The next

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
thing I think of

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
is why

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
don't you

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
make it

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
infinite?

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
This

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
line becomes

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
a smooth

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
function.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
A very

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
good question.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Your

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
limitation

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
is not

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
how big

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
a step

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
is,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
right?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
But what

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
does every step

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
mean?

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Every step

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
needs at

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
least one

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
line,

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
right?

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
But the

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
network is

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
made up

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
of limited

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
lines,

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
so you

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
can't have

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
infinite steps

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
because you

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
need at

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
least one

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
line every

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
time.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
So you

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
can only

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
have n

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
lines,

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
so you

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
can only

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
have

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
one

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
line every

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
time.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
For

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
example,

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
if I

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
want to

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
make a

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
better

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
step,

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
but

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
it

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
gets

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
bigger

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
in the

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
middle,

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
I

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
don't

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
enjoy

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
anything.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
I

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
lose

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
some

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
frequency.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
So

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
we want

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
the process

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
to be

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
as short

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
as

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
possible.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
We

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
can't do

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
that in

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
reality.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
The

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
second

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
thing is

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
that even

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
if we

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
consider

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
an infinite

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
network,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
we

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
don't want

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
to do

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
that because

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
we want

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
to get

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
to the

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
new

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
state as

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
soon as

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
possible

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
so that

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
we

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
can have

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
more

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
flexibility.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
For

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
example,

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
we can

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
ask a

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
few

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
questions.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
We

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
call this

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
a

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
re-adaptation

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
planning

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
problem.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
How

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
do I

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
adjust

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
this

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
variable

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
network

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
plan?

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
How

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
many

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
steps

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
do I

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
need to

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
do?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
The

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
first

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
question is

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
how

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
do I

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
solve this

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
problem?

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Is

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
there

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
a way

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
to

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
solve it?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Unfortunately,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
this is

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
a very

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
difficult

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
problem

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
called

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
NP-hard.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
This

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
is a

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
very

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
difficult

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
problem

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
in

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
computer

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
science.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
It's

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
basically

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
very difficult

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
to

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
solve

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
this

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
problem.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
If

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
I

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
didn't

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
calculate it

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
accurately,

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
it's

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
basically

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
the same

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
as

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
the

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
NP-hard

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
problem.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
The

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
problem

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
is

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
too

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
difficult.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
It's

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
not only

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
difficult

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
to find

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
the best

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
plan,

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
it's

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
also

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
difficult

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
to

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
solve

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
the

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
problem.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
This

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
is

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
a very

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
difficult

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
problem.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
It's

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
very

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
difficult

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
to

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
solve

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
the

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
problem.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
The

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
problem

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
is

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
too

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
difficult

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
to

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
solve.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
It's

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
very

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
difficult

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
to

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
solve

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
the

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
problem.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
It's

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
a

very

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
difficult

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
The

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
is

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000

difficult

45:53.040 --> 45:54.040
that

45:54.040 --> 45:55.040
pride

45:55.040 --> 45:56.040

47:22.060 --> 47:23.060
王

47:23.060 --> 47:24.060
王

47:25.060 --> 47:26.060
王

47:26.060 --> 47:27.060
王

47:27.060 --> 47:28.060
王

47:28.060 --> 47:29.060
王

47:29.060 --> 47:30.060
王

47:30.060 --> 47:31.060
王

47:31.060 --> 47:32.060
王

47:32.060 --> 47:33.060
王

47:33.060 --> 47:34.060
王

47:34.060 --> 47:35.060
王

47:37.060 --> 47:38.060
王

47:39.060 --> 47:40.060
王

47:40.060 --> 47:41.060
王

47:41.060 --> 47:42.060
王

47:42.060 --> 47:43.060
王

47:43.060 --> 47:44.060
王

47:44.060 --> 47:45.060
王

47:45.060 --> 47:46.060
王

47:46.080 --> 47:52.080
So, did our proposal really cut off the traffic?

47:52.080 --> 47:57.080
Did we really avoid this from happening?

47:57.080 --> 47:59.080
And then,

47:59.080 --> 48:02.080
we said that we have heuristics.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.080
Is this heuristic easy to calculate?

48:05.080 --> 48:07.080
Or is it actually difficult to calculate?

48:07.080 --> 48:09.080
If it's also difficult to calculate,

48:09.080 --> 48:10.080
we didn't mention one thing,

48:10.080 --> 48:12.080
and then we have to calculate for a long time,

48:12.080 --> 48:13.080
for example, for ten minutes,

48:13.080 --> 48:14.080
we can only update our link.

48:14.100 --> 48:16.100
If we update our link,

48:16.100 --> 48:18.100
and then the traffic changes,

48:18.100 --> 48:20.100
then we won't have enough time.

48:20.100 --> 48:23.100
So, we hope that it can be calculated soon.

48:23.100 --> 48:25.100
So, we did some experiments.

48:25.100 --> 48:27.100
We first used

48:27.100 --> 48:31.100
Microsoft's Microsoft Swan

48:31.100 --> 48:33.100
and Google's Beeple

48:33.100 --> 48:35.100
to do the experiment.

48:35.100 --> 48:37.100
And then our

48:37.100 --> 48:38.100
Skynet design heuristic,

48:38.100 --> 48:40.100
we call it ALG.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.120
And OPT,

48:41.120 --> 48:45.120
we call it the best solution.

48:45.120 --> 48:48.120
So, let's answer the first question.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.120
After we add this

48:50.120 --> 48:52.120
heuristic condition,

48:52.120 --> 48:55.120
can we get

48:55.120 --> 48:57.120
a better rating?

48:57.120 --> 48:59.120
The conclusion is yes.

48:59.120 --> 49:04.120
This row equal to one,

49:04.120 --> 49:06.120
if we call this heuristic

49:06.120 --> 49:07.120
as 1,

49:07.120 --> 49:08.120
we can never

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
lose any rating.

49:09.140 --> 49:10.140
That means we basically

49:10.140 --> 49:12.140
don't update our links.

49:12.140 --> 49:14.140
We can never

49:14.140 --> 49:16.140
lose any network traffic.

49:16.140 --> 49:18.140
The simplest way is

49:18.140 --> 49:19.140
we don't move,

49:19.140 --> 49:21.140
and we will never lose any traffic.

49:21.140 --> 49:23.140
The original overall rating

49:23.140 --> 49:24.140
is like this,

49:24.140 --> 49:26.140
the column on the far left.

49:26.140 --> 49:27.140
The column on the far right

49:27.140 --> 49:29.140
is the solution

49:29.140 --> 49:31.140
proposed by Microsoft.

49:31.140 --> 49:32.140
If we lose in the middle,

49:32.140 --> 49:34.140
how much can we get in the end?

49:34.140 --> 49:35.140
We can see that

49:35.140 --> 49:37.140
even if we add

49:37.160 --> 49:39.160
this perseverance limitation,

49:39.160 --> 49:40.160
we still,

49:40.160 --> 49:42.160
whether it's the best solution

49:42.160 --> 49:44.160
or our heuristic,

49:44.160 --> 49:45.160
in the end,

49:45.160 --> 49:48.160
they can be the same

49:48.160 --> 49:50.160
as the solution

49:50.160 --> 49:53.160
proposed by Microsoft.

49:53.160 --> 49:55.160
Basically the same.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.160
That is to say,

49:56.160 --> 49:57.160
although we have perseverance limitation,

49:57.160 --> 49:59.160
we are more smooth

49:59.160 --> 50:00.160
than the original proposal

50:00.160 --> 50:01.160
proposed by Microsoft.

50:01.160 --> 50:03.160
But we can't get

50:03.160 --> 50:04.160
the best rating

50:04.160 --> 50:05.160
because of that.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.160
In fact,

50:06.180 --> 50:07.180
we can't get

50:07.180 --> 50:08.180
the same rating

50:08.180 --> 50:09.180
as Microsoft.

50:09.180 --> 50:10.180
So,

50:10.180 --> 50:11.180
this is the answer

50:11.180 --> 50:13.180
to the first question.

50:13.180 --> 50:15.180
The second question is

50:15.180 --> 50:17.180
what kind of number

50:17.180 --> 50:19.180
should we set

50:19.180 --> 50:20.180
as our perseverance level?

50:20.180 --> 50:21.180
That is,

50:21.180 --> 50:22.180
what kind of loss

50:22.180 --> 50:23.180
can we accept?

50:23.180 --> 50:24.180
We can see

50:24.180 --> 50:26.180
what the second picture

50:26.180 --> 50:27.180
is about.

50:27.180 --> 50:28.180
That is,

50:28.180 --> 50:29.180
the process of update,

50:29.180 --> 50:30.180
the process of overall rating increase.

50:30.180 --> 50:32.180
If we start with

50:32.180 --> 50:34.180
a 0.5 perseverance,

50:34.200 --> 50:35.200
0.5 perseverance,

50:35.200 --> 50:36.200
that is to say,

50:36.200 --> 50:37.200
I can accept

50:37.200 --> 50:39.200
that I only have 0.5 left.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.200
Of course,

50:40.200 --> 50:42.200
we give the system operator

50:42.200 --> 50:43.200
a lot of space

50:43.200 --> 50:45.200
to adjust these lines.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.200
So we can reach

50:46.200 --> 50:48.200
our final level very quickly.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.200
Of course,

50:49.200 --> 50:51.200
the less loss I am willing to accept,

50:51.200 --> 50:52.200
that is to say,

50:52.200 --> 50:54.200
the higher the perseverance limitation I require,

50:54.200 --> 50:56.200
the less links

50:56.200 --> 50:57.200
I can update every time.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.200
Because if I cut off a lot of links,

50:58.200 --> 51:00.200
I can't ensure

51:00.200 --> 51:02.200
that the original

51:02.220 --> 51:04.220
load flow

51:04.220 --> 51:06.220
can still reach

51:06.220 --> 51:08.220
the original 0.9 level.

51:08.220 --> 51:09.220
That is to say,

51:09.220 --> 51:10.220
it will be slower.

51:10.220 --> 51:12.220
This requires more steps

51:12.220 --> 51:16.220
to reach the final level.

51:16.220 --> 51:18.220
So the higher the perseverance limitation,

51:18.220 --> 51:19.220
of course,

51:19.220 --> 51:21.220
the slower you will be.

51:21.220 --> 51:22.220
Then we will ask,

51:22.220 --> 51:26.220
if there is a perseverance limitation,

51:26.240 --> 51:28.240
what is the relationship

51:28.240 --> 51:30.240
with my

51:30.240 --> 51:33.240
converge time?

51:33.240 --> 51:34.240
Of course,

51:34.240 --> 51:37.240
if you are willing to

51:37.240 --> 51:39.240
accept more interference,

51:39.240 --> 51:40.240
that is to say,

51:40.240 --> 51:41.240
if you are willing to accept more disturbance,

51:41.240 --> 51:42.240
the faster you will

51:42.240 --> 51:44.240
get to your final state.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.240
This is the same as the picture just now.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.240
This is a more detailed picture.

51:47.240 --> 51:48.240
That is to say,

51:48.240 --> 51:51.240
we ran 1000 random cases,

51:51.240 --> 51:52.240
and we found that

51:52.240 --> 51:53.240
of course,

51:53.240 --> 51:54.240
the higher the perseverance level,

51:54.260 --> 51:56.260
the more time it takes to converge.

51:58.260 --> 51:59.260
We can find that

51:59.260 --> 52:00.260
most of the time,

52:00.260 --> 52:02.260
your perseverance level

52:02.260 --> 52:05.260
is between 0.5 and 0.7.

52:05.260 --> 52:06.260
That is to say,

52:06.260 --> 52:08.260
it will converge pretty fast.

52:08.260 --> 52:11.260
It will converge pretty fast.

52:11.260 --> 52:12.260
It won't converge

52:12.260 --> 52:14.260
when it is set to a very high level.

52:14.260 --> 52:16.260
So our best choice is this.

52:16.260 --> 52:17.260
That is to say,

52:17.260 --> 52:19.260
we can converge

52:19.260 --> 52:20.260
in 3 to 5 steps.

52:20.260 --> 52:21.260
At the same time,

52:21.260 --> 52:22.260
we keep the original

52:22.280 --> 52:24.280
flow rate between 0.5 and 0.7.

52:24.280 --> 52:25.280
That's actually not bad.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.280
At least 7 steps.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.280
Compared to the original

52:27.280 --> 52:28.280
that we threw away directly,

52:28.280 --> 52:30.280
we still have 5 to 7 steps

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
to throw away.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.280
We originally

52:35.280 --> 52:36.280
argued that

52:36.280 --> 52:37.280
this perseverance level

52:37.280 --> 52:39.280
can make the whole process

52:39.280 --> 52:40.280
smoother.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.280
That is to say,

52:41.280 --> 52:42.280
we won't throw away a lot of traffic.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.280
Is that so?

52:43.280 --> 52:45.280
Let's take a look at

52:45.280 --> 52:47.280
the degree of vibration

52:47.280 --> 52:50.280
in the update process.

52:50.300 --> 52:51.300
The more vibration,

52:51.300 --> 52:52.300
the more to the right.

52:52.300 --> 52:53.300
The less vibration,

52:53.300 --> 52:54.300
the more to the left.

52:54.300 --> 52:55.300
Can you see

52:55.300 --> 52:56.300
that we have introduced

52:56.300 --> 52:57.300
these two methods

52:57.300 --> 52:59.300
of perseverance limitation?

52:59.300 --> 53:01.300
Its vibrations are very few.

53:01.300 --> 53:02.300
It's not very few.

53:02.300 --> 53:03.300
Its vibrations are smaller

53:03.300 --> 53:04.300
than the original

53:04.300 --> 53:06.300
Microsoft Red1 method.

53:06.300 --> 53:07.300
That is to say,

53:07.300 --> 53:08.300
our perseverance limitation

53:08.300 --> 53:10.300
does help

53:10.300 --> 53:12.300
the whole update process

53:12.300 --> 53:13.300
to be smoother.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.300
The last question

53:16.300 --> 53:17.300
we want to answer is that

53:17.320 --> 53:19.320
this is great.

53:19.320 --> 53:20.320
We are very smooth.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.320
But how long

53:21.320 --> 53:22.320
does it take to get it?

53:22.320 --> 53:23.320
If it takes a long time,

53:23.320 --> 53:24.320
it will be lost.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.320
Let's take a look at

53:26.320 --> 53:27.320
the computation time.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.320
The computation time

53:28.320 --> 53:29.320
is how long

53:29.320 --> 53:30.320
it takes

53:30.320 --> 53:31.320
to find

53:31.320 --> 53:33.320
a solution.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.320
The time on our watch

53:35.320 --> 53:36.320
is millisecond.

53:36.320 --> 53:37.320
That is to say,

53:37.320 --> 53:38.320
millisecond.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.320
If we want to find the best solution,

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
it can't be calculated

53:45.320 --> 53:46.320
in a very short time.

53:46.340 --> 53:47.340
But in fact,

53:47.340 --> 53:49.340
if your network is very small,

53:49.340 --> 53:51.340
this thing can be solved by force.

53:51.340 --> 53:52.340
You just force

53:52.340 --> 53:54.340
to find all the possible solutions.

53:54.340 --> 53:55.340
In fact,

53:55.340 --> 53:56.340
it can be calculated quite quickly.

53:56.340 --> 53:57.340
For example,

53:57.340 --> 53:58.340
if you want to find the best solution,

53:58.340 --> 54:01.340
it takes 67 milliseconds.

54:01.340 --> 54:03.340
If you have a bigger network,

54:03.340 --> 54:05.340
a bigger network,

54:05.340 --> 54:06.340
it takes more seconds.

54:06.340 --> 54:08.340
Until you have this,

54:08.340 --> 54:09.340
for example,

54:09.340 --> 54:11.340
this is a Google network.

54:11.340 --> 54:12.340
Google network,

54:12.340 --> 54:13.340
you have to spend

54:13.340 --> 54:15.340
1.2 times 16 times

54:15.360 --> 54:16.360
milliseconds to find one.

54:16.360 --> 54:17.360
How much is that?

54:17.360 --> 54:18.360
This is about

54:18.360 --> 54:19.360
more than 1,000 seconds

54:19.360 --> 54:20.360
to calculate

54:20.360 --> 54:22.360
the process of updating once.

54:22.360 --> 54:23.360
After you finish the calculation,

54:23.360 --> 54:24.360
after 1,000 seconds,

54:24.360 --> 54:25.360
you may have changed the message again.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.360
Then you just

54:26.360 --> 54:28.360
wasted your time.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.360
In contrast,

54:29.360 --> 54:30.360
our algorithm,

54:30.360 --> 54:31.360
our heuristic,

54:31.360 --> 54:33.360
only takes more than 300 milliseconds

54:33.360 --> 54:34.360
to calculate.

54:34.360 --> 54:35.360
That is to say,

54:35.360 --> 54:36.360
in less than a second,

54:36.360 --> 54:39.360
we can tell the entire network

54:39.360 --> 54:41.360
how to adjust.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.360
This efficiency is very high.

54:43.380 --> 54:45.380
The speed of our calculation

54:45.380 --> 54:46.380
is very fast.

54:46.380 --> 54:47.380
And we can also

54:47.380 --> 54:48.380
let this

54:48.380 --> 54:49.380
be found in the previous

54:49.380 --> 54:50.380
few experiments.

54:50.380 --> 54:52.380
In fact, the algorithm we proposed

54:52.380 --> 54:54.380
is not much different from the best solution.

54:54.380 --> 54:56.380
Although we can't prove

54:56.380 --> 54:58.380
that they are always close to each other,

54:58.380 --> 55:00.380
because we just said

55:00.380 --> 55:02.380
that this thing can't be

55:02.380 --> 55:05.380
done on this mirror.

55:05.380 --> 55:06.380
But in fact,

55:06.380 --> 55:08.380
in terms of real things,

55:08.380 --> 55:09.380
the solution we calculated

55:09.380 --> 55:11.380
is not much different from the best solution.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.400
And our algorithm

55:13.400 --> 55:14.400
is very fast.

55:14.400 --> 55:15.400
This is the benefit

55:15.400 --> 55:17.400
of our new solution.

55:18.400 --> 55:19.400
To sum up,

55:19.400 --> 55:21.400
what is this paper

55:21.400 --> 55:22.400
talking about?

55:22.400 --> 55:23.400
This paper says

55:23.400 --> 55:25.400
that instead of cutting

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
all the lines directly

55:26.400 --> 55:27.400
and then update them,

55:27.400 --> 55:28.400
and then we use

55:28.400 --> 55:29.400
a higher frequency

55:29.400 --> 55:31.400
to send new traffic,

55:31.400 --> 55:33.400
we should consider

55:33.400 --> 55:34.400
consistency.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.400
That is, we need to make sure

55:35.400 --> 55:37.400
that the network traffic

55:37.400 --> 55:39.400
is not lost too much

55:39.420 --> 55:41.420
in the process of traffic.

55:41.420 --> 55:44.420
Considering this consistency,

55:44.420 --> 55:46.420
it won't cause too much burden.

55:46.420 --> 55:47.420
Because we have

55:47.420 --> 55:48.420
a very good algorithm.

55:48.420 --> 55:50.420
It can quickly

55:50.420 --> 55:51.420
solve this problem.

55:51.420 --> 55:52.420
It can quickly approach this problem.

55:52.420 --> 55:53.420
It's not a solution,

55:53.420 --> 55:54.420
but it can quickly

55:54.420 --> 55:55.420
find a solution.

55:55.420 --> 55:56.420
And this solution

55:56.420 --> 55:59.420
is actually pretty good.

55:59.420 --> 56:00.420
It's not much different

56:00.420 --> 56:01.420
from the best solution.

56:01.420 --> 56:03.420
It's not much different

56:03.420 --> 56:04.420
from the performance

56:04.420 --> 56:05.420
of cutting directly.

56:05.420 --> 56:06.420
But it's very

56:06.420 --> 56:08.420
smoother than

56:08.440 --> 56:10.440
cutting directly.

56:12.440 --> 56:13.440
Of course, we also admit that

56:13.440 --> 56:17.440
in addition to consistency,

56:17.440 --> 56:19.440
system operators

56:19.440 --> 56:20.440
can also consider

56:20.440 --> 56:21.440
more different aspects.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.440
For example,

56:22.440 --> 56:23.440
in the middle of the network,

56:23.440 --> 56:24.440
in the middle of the update,

56:24.440 --> 56:25.440
we hope that

56:25.440 --> 56:26.440
these traffic

56:26.440 --> 56:28.440
are not lost too much.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.440
We may also hope that

56:30.440 --> 56:32.440
they have some other

56:32.440 --> 56:34.440
characteristics.

56:34.440 --> 56:35.440
For example,

56:35.440 --> 56:36.440
each traffic

56:36.460 --> 56:38.460
cannot be less than

56:38.460 --> 56:41.460
the absolute traffic.

56:41.460 --> 56:42.460
For example,

56:42.460 --> 56:44.460
I must be greater than 10Mbps,

56:44.460 --> 56:45.460
I must be greater than 20Mbps.

56:45.460 --> 56:47.460
It may not be a percentage,

56:47.460 --> 56:48.460
but an absolute traffic.

56:48.460 --> 56:49.460
We must maintain

56:49.460 --> 56:50.460
how much traffic.

56:50.460 --> 56:51.460
Otherwise,

56:51.460 --> 56:52.460
I won't,

56:52.460 --> 56:53.460
for example,

56:53.460 --> 56:54.460
I won't feel a lot of delay

56:54.460 --> 56:55.460
in the middle of playing video games.

56:55.460 --> 56:57.460
How much traffic do I need at least?

56:57.460 --> 56:58.460
For example, like this.

56:58.460 --> 56:59.460
So this system operator

56:59.460 --> 57:00.460
can actually adjust

57:00.460 --> 57:01.460
their requirements

57:01.460 --> 57:03.460
for the network.

57:03.480 --> 57:04.480
And then,

57:04.480 --> 57:05.480
let this network

57:05.480 --> 57:07.480
operate more effectively,

57:07.480 --> 57:08.480
more efficiently.

57:08.480 --> 57:09.480
And they can,

57:09.480 --> 57:10.480
in the end,

57:10.480 --> 57:12.480
get a better balance.

57:12.480 --> 57:13.480
That's all

57:13.480 --> 57:15.480
for my speech today.

57:15.480 --> 57:17.480
If you have any questions,

57:17.480 --> 57:18.480
please feel free to ask.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.480
Thank you for listening.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
This topic,

57:21.480 --> 57:22.480
this topic

57:22.480 --> 57:24.480
is a little bit harder.

57:24.480 --> 57:25.480
So,

57:25.480 --> 57:26.480
if you have any questions,

57:26.480 --> 57:27.480
please feel free to ask.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.480
Let me welcome,

57:30.480 --> 57:31.480
let me give a round of applause

57:31.480 --> 57:32.480
on behalf of everyone.

57:33.480 --> 57:34.480
Yeah.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.480
Okay,

57:35.480 --> 57:36.480
do you have any questions?

57:36.480 --> 57:37.480
Do you have any questions?

57:37.480 --> 57:39.480
Let me ask.

57:39.480 --> 57:40.480
Yes.

57:40.480 --> 57:41.480
For example,

57:41.480 --> 57:42.480
if you are now

57:42.480 --> 57:43.480
changing

57:43.480 --> 57:44.480
their,

57:44.480 --> 57:45.480
for example,

57:45.480 --> 57:47.480
the two ends of the fiber.

57:47.480 --> 57:48.480
For example,

57:48.480 --> 57:49.480
the way they receive

57:49.480 --> 57:51.480
modulation.

57:51.480 --> 57:52.480
Yes.

57:52.480 --> 57:53.480
So,

57:53.480 --> 57:54.480
on the hardware,

57:54.480 --> 57:55.480
will this thing need to be changed for a long time?

57:55.480 --> 57:56.480
For example,

57:56.480 --> 57:57.480
you were,

57:58.480 --> 57:59.480
for example,

57:59.480 --> 58:00.480
you said green light, red light, blue light.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.480
Maybe it was only red and yellow.

58:01.480 --> 58:02.480
Then you added

58:02.500 --> 58:03.500
green light into it.

58:03.500 --> 58:04.500
Yes.

58:04.500 --> 58:05.500
Will it work

58:05.500 --> 58:07.500
on the hardware?

58:07.500 --> 58:08.500
This is a very good question.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.500
Yes,

58:09.500 --> 58:10.500
it works.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.500
Then how long does it take?

58:11.500 --> 58:13.500
At the time of RedOne,

58:13.500 --> 58:14.500
in 2018,

58:14.500 --> 58:15.500
it took

58:16.500 --> 58:18.500
a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds.

58:19.500 --> 58:20.500
Every step,

58:20.500 --> 58:21.500
a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds.

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
Of course,

58:22.500 --> 58:23.500
we can consider,

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
if you say

58:24.500 --> 58:25.500
a few dozen to a few hundred milliseconds,

58:25.500 --> 58:26.500
there is no difference, right?

58:26.500 --> 58:27.500
But if you consider

58:27.500 --> 58:28.500
these are broadband networks,

58:28.500 --> 58:29.500
these broadband networks

58:29.500 --> 58:31.500
carry a lot of traffic.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.520
It may have a few terabytes of traffic

58:33.520 --> 58:36.520
or a few thousand terabytes.

58:36.520 --> 58:38.520
Multiplied by a few hundred milliseconds,

58:38.520 --> 58:40.520
that is a very objective

58:40.520 --> 58:41.520
traffic loss.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.520
But,

58:44.520 --> 58:45.520
how did it work before?

58:45.520 --> 58:46.520
It used to be like

58:46.520 --> 58:47.520
you said,

58:47.520 --> 58:48.520
what if you want to add red light,

58:48.520 --> 58:49.520
add blue light?

58:49.520 --> 58:50.520
It is to turn off both sides first.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.520
Because your laser needs to be adjusted again.

58:53.520 --> 58:54.520
After you adjust the laser again,

58:54.520 --> 58:56.520
you let it send out the laser again.

58:57.520 --> 58:58.520
So,

58:58.520 --> 58:59.520
turning it off and restarting

58:59.540 --> 59:01.540
is actually very slow.

59:01.540 --> 59:02.540
Now,

59:02.540 --> 59:03.540
why does it need a few hundred milliseconds?

59:03.540 --> 59:04.540
It was mentioned

59:04.540 --> 59:05.540
in the original RedOne paper.

59:05.540 --> 59:06.540
They said,

59:06.540 --> 59:07.540
if we say

59:07.540 --> 59:09.540
turning it off and restarting

59:09.540 --> 59:10.540
is a major factor

59:10.540 --> 59:12.540
in causing this delay,

59:12.540 --> 59:14.540
we can try not to turn it off and restart.

59:14.540 --> 59:16.540
If you don't turn it off and restart,

59:16.540 --> 59:18.540
they can't make it work

59:18.540 --> 59:20.540
at that time.

59:20.540 --> 59:22.540
But they estimate that

59:22.540 --> 59:24.540
if you don't turn it off and restart,

59:24.540 --> 59:26.540
it may only take

59:26.540 --> 59:28.540
a microsecond

59:28.560 --> 59:30.560
to reach

59:30.560 --> 59:32.560
the goal of re-adjustment.

59:33.560 --> 59:34.560
If we say

59:34.560 --> 59:35.560
our future network

59:35.560 --> 59:36.560
can be seamless,

59:36.560 --> 59:37.560
that is,

59:37.560 --> 59:38.560
if I want to re-adjust,

59:38.560 --> 59:39.560
I can re-adjust immediately.

59:39.560 --> 59:40.560
Then,

59:40.560 --> 59:41.560
of course,

59:41.560 --> 59:42.560
our research

59:42.560 --> 59:43.560
has nothing

59:43.560 --> 59:44.560
to do with

59:44.560 --> 59:47.560
their original research.

59:47.560 --> 59:48.560
Because we basically

59:48.560 --> 59:49.560
don't lose anything.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.560
So,

59:51.560 --> 59:52.560
I think this question is very important.

59:52.560 --> 59:53.560
In the end,

59:53.560 --> 59:54.560
how is it done on hardware?

59:54.560 --> 59:55.560
Can it be done?

59:55.560 --> 59:56.560
Yes, it can be done.

59:56.580 --> 59:57.580
Is there any other

59:57.580 --> 59:58.580
research requirement on hardware?

59:58.580 --> 59:59.580
Yes,

59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.580
that is,

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.580
how do we adjust

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.580
this modulation

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:03.580
dynamically?

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.580
In fact,

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:06.580
there are many ways

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.580
that can be thought of.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.580
For example,

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.580
we can send the modulation

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.580
in advance,

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.580
right?

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.580
Then I will tell the other person

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.580
when I start

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.580
to use this new modulation.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.580
In the middle,

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.580
it may need

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580
some ways

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.580
to let the two sides communicate.

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.580
For example,

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.580
you want to use a clock.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.580
That is,

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.580
you want to make

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600
the timing

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.600
good enough.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600
For example,

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.600
I will immediately switch

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600
both sides at 7 o'clock.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600
This is actually quite difficult

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.600
because you have to

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600
synchronize both sides.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
That is to say,

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600
your time is consistent.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600
In fact,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600
sometimes it's not that easy.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600
Another way is

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600
you send some

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.600
this packet,

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600
send some information.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600
That is,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600
in addition to your

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600
information,

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600
send some

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.600
control messages

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600
to the other side

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.600
and tell him

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600
I want to start using it.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600
Then,

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600
which packet

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.600
do I start using?

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600
For example,

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620
it's a little more complicated.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620
Because the current

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.620
system is not designed like this.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:59.620
Their original system

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620
may have imagined

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.620
that once you turn it on,

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.620
what is the modulation?

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620
Just keep using it.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.620
So, in the middle,

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.620
there are actually

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.620
a lot of research that can be done.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.620
Does this answer your question?

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:13.620
Yes.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.620
So, you said

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.620
Microsoft

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.620
changed

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:20.620
the modulation method like this.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.620
How many times can it be improved?

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.620
Or how many percent?

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.640
How many times can it be improved?

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640
Its improvement

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.640
is actually pretty good.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640
Let me find

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.640
its original paper.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640
I don't know if you can see

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640
the original.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.640
It's not good for me to show the paper directly.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.640
But it doesn't matter.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640
Let's take a look.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.640
When you show it,

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.640
before you finish,

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.640
you swipe to its title page

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.640
and show the author.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640
The author.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.660
Do you know why?

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.660
Does it mean you can see the author?

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.660
Yes.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.660
If you look at its original paper,

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:00.660
it's actually...

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:01.660
Let me see.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.660
It can actually improve

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.660
a lot of traffic.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.660
Or it can

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.660
avoid traffic drop.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.660
But because their original

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:16.660
paper

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.660
talks about

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.660
a pretty simple

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.660
network.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.660
It only has four points.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.660
These four points

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.660
are in California.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.660
So this

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.660
is just a prototype.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.660
So

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.660
when it's actually used,

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.660
we can only say

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.660
it has a lot of potential.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.660
But in the end,

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.660
when it's actually used,

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.660
it's not sure

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.660
if it's good or not.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.660
But this idea

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.660
has a lot of potential.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.660
This is the paper.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.660
Whatsoever published this paper.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680
Whatsoever published this paper.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680
The purpose of this paper

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680
is to say

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.680
this idea is pretty good.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680
But

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680
our update

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680
doesn't need to be so crude.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680
It can be more detailed.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680
This concept.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.680
Of course, if we have better

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.680
hardware in the future,

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.680
then...

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.680
Go ahead.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680
My question is this.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680
When you're doing

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.680
your simulation,

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.680
basically,

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.680
you have to have some assumptions

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.680
about disturbance.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.700
Yes.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.700
What kind of

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.700
situation are you in

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.700
to compare?

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.700
So your disturbance

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.700
is like,

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.700
Google,

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.700
what do they do?

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.700
Or how do you

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.700
generate

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.700
the disturbance

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.700
in your simulation?

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.700
This is a good question.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.700
So

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.700
what I actually generate

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:32.700
is not disturbance.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.700
What I generate is

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.700
this link

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.700
the current state

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.700
and the next state.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700
So I actually

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700
added a layer

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:41.700
of assumption.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.700
That is to say,

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720
let's assume that

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720
my current link

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720
can only send

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720
50 gigabytes per second.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.720
50 Gbps.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720
And then

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720
because

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.720
the noise has dropped

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.720
I can send 100 Gbps now.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.720
How should I update?

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720
So

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720
in the middle

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.720
I put the

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.720
relationship between

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.720
noise and signal

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.720
in there.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720
In fact,

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.720
in operation,

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.720
of course,

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.720
there are

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.720
other restrictions.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720
In fact,

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.740
there is also in the paper.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.740
But I don't want to

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.740
show this paper again.

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.740
That is to say,

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.740
the adjustment of our screen width

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.740
is actually

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.740
not continuous.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.740
That is to say,

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740
the screen width

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.740
we can use

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740
is not continuous.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.740
For example,

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.740
25 Mbps,

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:25.740
50 Mbps,

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.740
100 Mbps,

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:27.740
150,

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.740
like this.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.740
So,

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:30.740
you are actually

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:31.740
choosing these kinds.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:32.740
No matter how much noise you have,

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.740
when it reaches

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:34.740
a certain point

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.740
you can probably

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:36.740
adjust it up.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.740
You can adjust it

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.740
from 100 to 150

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.740
or 150 to 200.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.760
But in fact,

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760
why can you adjust

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760
the principle

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.760
is what I just said

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.760
about the noise.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.760
So, in fact,

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.760
how is it measured?

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760
I don't have

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.760
this information.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.760
I just

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760
make an assumption

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760
based on the range

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760
it can adjust.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760
So, my assumption

01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.760
is that

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.760
the original link

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.760
may be

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.760
in this

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.760
100 Gbps

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.760
mode.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.760
Because

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.760
my

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.760
noise

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760
may be reduced,

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:09.780
so now

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.780
suddenly this link

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:11.780
can reach 200 Gbps.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:12.780
If it is

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.780
in this situation,

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.780
how do we

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.780
go from 100 to 200 Gbps?

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.780
So, a better way

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.780
is

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:20.780
you have already

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.780
assumed

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.780
your work goal

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.780
is to adjust like this.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.780
But you tell it

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.780
how to be smarter.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780
Not that

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780
it's not

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:28.780
that

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.780
it's not like

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:30.780
at the analog level

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:31.780
that

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:32.780
the noise pattern is like this,

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.780
so we should

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.780
decide

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.780
what state to adjust.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:36.780
That is already

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.780
a given

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800
assumption.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800
Yes, a given.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800
So, let's say

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800
my device tells me

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800
this thing.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800
I see.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800
My research

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800
is usually

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800
at a higher level.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800
So, let's say

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800
the device tells me

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800
these things,

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800
how do I plan

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800
this thing?

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Okay, anyone else

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800
have any questions?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800
Okay, if not,

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.800
let's

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800
give another round of applause

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.800
to Shihai.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.800
Thank you, everyone.

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.820
Thank you.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:07.820
Okay, that's all

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.820
for today's lecture.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.820
I'll...
