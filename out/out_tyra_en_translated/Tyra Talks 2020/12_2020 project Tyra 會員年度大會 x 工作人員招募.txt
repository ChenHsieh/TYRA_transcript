Hello everyone, I am today's keynote speaker, Jason Hong.
I am now a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan.
I am also a Project Taira staff member.
Project Taira stands for the Taiwanese Young Researchers Association.
The purpose of today's event is to provide suggestions and feedback.
We hope that Project Taira will continue to grow and improve.
At the beginning, I would like to talk about what Project Taira is currently doing,
and what questions we would like to ask.
This video is the summary of Project Taira.
We hope to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,
to connect with Taiwanese academics from all over the world,
to communicate about the development, results, and trends of overseas and Taiwan academic circles,
and to provide each other with an effective platform for communication.
This is basically the purpose of Project Taira.
We hope that young Taiwanese academics from all over the world can come to this platform,
and share information with each other.
Our organization currently has two websites.
The first is our blog, where we publish our weekly speeches.
The second is our Facebook page, where you can find our information.
Let me talk a little bit about what Project Taira has been doing in recent years.
The first thing we are doing is to prepare a regular speech every week.
We have been doing this speech from 2017 to now, about 4 to 5 years.
If you go to our blog, the page will tell you what the topic of our next week's speech is.
There are many topics, and it will tell you the main time.
We hope that the main time will be around 6 to 7 p.m. in the west coast of the United States.
This time will be around 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the east coast of the United States.
If you are in Taiwan, you may hear this speech at 10 a.m.
We mainly do this on weekends, such as Saturdays and Sundays.
We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.
We hope that you can take the time to listen to our speech.
Every week, our speech will be recorded and posted on our blog.
If you have listeners who want to find the previous speech,
you may find some important information in the previous speech,
and you may go there to find it.
We hope that every week we can record the speech and put it in this space.
Sometimes, if the speech has not been published yet,
we can postpone the upload time.
According to our previous results,
we have found speakers from various fields.
This is a small part.
This may be related to air pollution, biology, astronomy,
or computer science.
We will share the information of the speech every week.
We use e-mail and the blog I just mentioned.
We will share it on Facebook.
We will also share it on the Facebook page of major alumni associations.
Finally, if you are a speaker and you give a speech,
we will send you an Amazon gift card at the end of the year.
It depends on our budget.
The above is our regular talk.
The second important thing we do is the summer special activities.
In the summer, because everyone is on vacation,
there is usually less time in the middle to give a speech.
In the middle, we will invite some people from outside to give us some speeches.
Some special and interesting speeches.
In 2018, we invited Liu Junlin to tell us
how to use some academic speech or presentation software.
For example, how to use LaTeX, how to use DeepLeaf.
I don't know what these are.
In 2019, we made some changes.
Our main focus was the ZR development symposium.
We invited two professors and an industry person
to share with us their experience in finding a job.
I believe this is a topic that many people are interested in.
This symposium has a very high attendance rate.
In 2020, two weeks ago,
we continued to do academic work and development symposium.
This event is co-organized with the Professor Association of Taiwan in North America.
This year, we invited them to co-organize the symposium.
We hope that we can get more information from the professor.
This year, there are some other activities.
For example, the annual member's meeting.
Two or three weeks later,
there will be a research project on Taiwan's first rocket.
Finally, there will be a symposium on the reform of higher education.
I think this symposium is quite interesting.
We invited the former president of the Research Student Association,
as well as some legal assistants and researchers from the Policy Research Center.
I hope that more people can participate in this symposium.
This symposium is very hard-earned by Professor Yan Yong, one of our staff members.
There are two important things that Taira has done so far.
There is a weekly speech and a special symposium or speech in the summer.
Let's take a look at the growth data.
You can give us some suggestions for reference.
The first graph shows the number of members and the time.
As you can see, we had a member system since the end of 2017.
It has continued to grow.
It looks pretty linear.
I hope we can continue to maintain it in the future.
So far, we have almost 300 members.
We held a total of 122 speeches.
If you look at our Facebook page, there are more than 2,000 members.
The graph on the right is the breakdown of our speech.
I divided it into several categories.
Because the topic is very complicated and diverse, I roughly divided it into several categories.
It's probably math, physics, chemistry, biology, other sciences, engineering, and humanities.
You can take a look at it.
So far, physics and biology seem to be the most popular.
Engineering is also quite a lot.
The number of members is actually the most in these categories.
But the number of speeches is not very clear.
The number of speeches seems to be the most in biology.
Next, if you add physics, it is also the most.
This is our breakdown.
The following is the IP address of the audience.
70% of the audience is from the United States.
About 20% of the audience is from Taiwan.
The rest are from Japan and some European countries.
The number of people on the line seems to be smaller and more professional.
So the number of people on the line is about 10 people.
Unless there is a symposium, the number of people on the line may exceed 50 or 40.
These 40 or 50 people are usually in a symposium.
This is a special event in the summer.
Finally, I would like to mention that there are organizations that cooperate with us and support us financially.
As mentioned earlier, we have some financial support.
These funds come from the Ministry of Education and TACO.
We also found some partners.
This is the Taiwan University Graduate Association and the North American and Taiwanese Professor Association.
There are also some activities from the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Unfortunately, we can't hold activities with them this year, but we hope to hold activities with them in the future.
We would like to hear some opinions from the ministers and scientists.
I hope to leave more time for meeting discussion.
I have listed some things that we want to discuss with you.
There are four main parts.
Membership rights, PR team, seminar team, and IT team.
As for the membership rights, the priority is higher.
We hope to change some membership rights and obligations.
We also hope to change some conditions and frequency for speeches.
Let's take a look at the following slide.
You can take a look at it.
In our blog, we mentioned the membership rights.
This is for doctoral students and post-doctoral students working in public or private institutions.
The main problem is the membership obligations.
In our previous membership obligations, there is a rule that members should give a speech every two years and share recent research results.
This rule is because a long time ago, the TARA group was actually a very small organization.
There were more than ten people at that time, and we had to give speeches in turns.
But now there are too many members, and it has become a big organization.
We hope to discuss how we should upgrade our speeches in the future.
What rights should we have as members?
How should TARA upgrade its speeches?
One of our proposals is to eliminate this obligation.
We don't need to give a speech every two years.
Giving a speech is your right.
In the future, we will try to find members who have a membership status.
We will try to find speakers from the members so that you can share your speech.
It's also a chance to practice speaking.
This is a change.
In addition, there are some job openings opportunities in universities and Taiwan.
They will provide us with job openings information.
We will forward this information to the members.
This is a new membership right.
According to these conditions, what we hope to do in the future is this.
If you are not a member and you are a non-member, you will go to a non-member registration form.
You need to fill out a form.
If you are a member, you will receive our letters on a regular basis.
You don't have to do anything. You just need to go online and participate in the speech.
In the future, we hope to change it to this.
We will make two Google Groups.
Basically, it's a group of non-members.
A group is responsible for the information of TeraTalks.
Every week, TeraTalks will be sent out by this letter.
You can freely choose whether you want to join or quit.
It's like a subscribe function.
You just need to subscribe.
It doesn't matter if you are a member or not.
For this reason, all members or non-members have to sign up for the speech.
You need to fill out a form to participate in the speech.
The second thing the Google Group does is to send the information of TeraTalks to everyone.
However, this is limited to the rights of members.
So far, we hope to make such a change.
Please listen to it.
There are other things we can discuss.
For example, the PR group.
One important thing is that TeraTalks has no official logo.
So we hope everyone can provide a logo.
Or we can hold a logo presentation.
We need to do something like this.
If you want us to work together, you can suggest it later.
We will have Q&A time later.
You can make a suggestion at that time.
Another thing is that the number of registrants we have seen so far.
If there are 30 people, only 15 people will participate in the speech.
It's weird. Where are the other 15 people?
For the seminar group, if you want us to make some adjustments in the field of speech.
Or if you want us to do something special in the summer.
Everyone can make a suggestion.
If you want to open a journal club, or want to do a forum in your field.
You can also discuss with us.
For the IT group, we mainly want to know the experience of using BlueDreams.
We want to know if there are any benefits of other online meeting software.
It is very, very necessary.
OK.
My report is about to end.
I hope everyone can, whether it's on this topic.
Or if you have anything else you want to discuss, you can mention it later.
This is our current staff.
Let me read the names.
Zhang Jianyuan, Zhang Yanping, Hong Shisan, Xu Youzhen, Wei Qunshu, Zhang Yanyong, Zhou Zhixian, Zhu Haoran, Su Yiyan, and Yang Jiayin.
OK.
We will have about 20 to 30 minutes of Q&A.
After that, we will have a small presentation for recruiting staff.
If you want to join our Taira organization, you are welcome to stay.
Our Taira organization needs new blood.
We need new blood.
The reason we founded this organization is that there are a group of young scholars.
Everyone can share with each other.
As you know, if there is a professor here, a professor who may be 40 or 50 years old, everyone will feel uncomfortable.
So we really want young scholars to join us.
Then we can finish this project together.
OK.
Let's start the discussion.
Does anyone have any comments?
Hello? I can't hear you.
There seems to be a serious echo.
Hello?
Sorry, there was a problem with my microphone.
I just told you that your video is gone.
And now it's back.
You are not playing, but it's back.
So what should we discuss now?
Should we discuss one group at a time or all at once?
Let's start with the membership rights.
This is what we want to know the most.
Do you have any questions about the membership rights or membership obligations?
Let me talk about why we proposed this.
Jason and I were mainly collecting speeches and then arranging them into annual schedules.
Then we found that there are too many people now.
If you calculate a little, there are more than 42 weeks a year, right?
No, sorry, there are more than 50 weeks.
Then deduct the holiday, we have to arrange 30 speeches a year.
But we have more than 200 people, so we just have to say that we want to collect speeches.
Even if we only limit the number of members to give speeches, we will usually line up far more than this year's slots.
Then it will be too much.
So we were a bit like a compulsory.
That is, we ask everyone to give a speech every one to two years.
This thing basically does not exist.
Because everyone is forced to give a speech, otherwise you will line up for three years.
This is also a strange thing.
Instead, many people come to ask if I can use this platform to share my speech.
Let me find potential partners.
Or let people who are interested in the same field as me get to know each other.
Then we can discuss.
It becomes a kind of benefit.
Basically, everyone who comes to participate now means that you are already members.
In theory, you can give your opinion on our policy.
What do you think?
Or do you have any other thoughts on this part?
Everyone is very silent.
Everyone seems to be very silent.
Yes.
If not, let's ask everyone else's opinion first.
Everyone may have no feeling for this.
Do you want to adjust the field of our speech?
Or do you have any interesting summer activities that you want to provide?
I can't see the chat.
I saw a lot of comments on the chat just now.
No, the chat is not important.
The chat is self-introduction.
It has nothing to do with what I told you.
OK.
Let me talk about this part.
It's the same as me and Jason.
We are having a speech.
We first found a problem.
In fact, there are quite a few people who have given us suggestions.
You may find that a very large part of TARA is focused on the speech in the field of science and technology.
This is not our intention.
We don't want to be biased in this way.
In fact, we really want to have humanitarian research, or even various kinds of research, to enter our organization.
Because the ultimate goal is to connect young people around the world to engage in research.
But the reason is simple.
Our network is very polite.
So our friends spread out like this.
Then TARA becomes a very polite organization.
There are even other similar academic exchanges.
They all say, aren't you just a polite academic organization?
They think we are positioned like this.
We found that when we start to give others such an impression, positive feedback will continue to make us more like this.
Then we have no way to break through the humanistic part.
So I don't know what you think.
This is the first one.
The other one is similar.
We are a very American-based organization.
This is also because the founders are all in the United States, so our circle of friends is also in the United States.
But we have always wanted to enter, that is to say, we can connect with European Taiwanese.
But this has always been a bit of a difficult thing.
I don't know what you think about this.
Or what do you think? Or what can we do?
Or if you want to provide a speaker specifically, you can also hope that he will give a speech.
Hello is my name is Zhong Boting, and I just joined the first time to attend this meeting.
And then I had not heard of any of your speeches at all.
And then I just a little bit, I have a little look at your previous speech, is the head of the head of the head.
And then I am a background in science and engineering.
And then I feel from the start it seems to be quite professional.
I do not know the content because I did not go to see the content, but just from the beginning to look at it, I feel very professional.
And then even if I am a science and engineering, I will have a little bit of rejection.
Because I do not understand the title at all.
And then I think this may be more for those of you who are talking about other fields.
Maybe those who are not science and engineering are not science and engineering.
They may be a little bit more sure.
So I was thinking, is it possible to give some more general?
Just from the title, it looks like a more general, everyone can participate.
It will be more interesting.
Oh, I see.
Yes, this is my feeling.
But I just joined the first time, so I just looked at the title of the previous talk very quickly.
Yes, I can understand this thing.
Yes, but the current title is actually written by the speaker.
We will not make any changes.
I'm not sure if your goal is to make it easier for everyone to understand and be interested.
Then there may be more people who really participate.
There is a chance to attract more people.
Sorry, can you hear my voice?
You go first.
Our current approach is that when the speaker comes, we will suggest that you can give a 10 to 20-minute background review.
It's about the general audience.
But we can't control what the speaker is going to do.
Some speakers will do it, some will not do it.
This is not something we can control.
I think maybe in the future we can discuss the topic and content with the speaker.
In this case, can we make him more generous?
What do you think, Yanyong?
I have a different opinion, but Zhang Yiping just said something.
Yes.
Zhang Yiping, don't talk first.
I told him not to talk first.
OK, I'll speak first.
No, Zhang Yiping, you go first.
I want to talk about what Zhang Yiyong just said.
I think our number of people, although it seems that if you compare, there are more volunteers.
But if you compare the number of people in the research institute, in Taiwan, especially in the United States,
I don't think we are particularly humanistic.
Because there are very few people who are humanistic.
So maybe...
You don't think there are many volunteers?
I don't think there are many volunteers because there are very few people who are humanistic.
So our people are relatively humanistic.
That's what I think.
There are not many, but I don't think this is a mistake.
Of course, if your interpretation is that everyone has to do 50% or 55%,
it may look like that, but this is actually a mistake.
I think this is a mistake.
I can add to Zhang Yiping.
It's about 5 to 1.
Hello everyone, I'm Yi An, and I'm a staff member.
I think in the past five years, from the doctoral students who graduated from North America,
there are about 500 to 600 so-called science majors every year,
and about 100 are humanities or humanities.
It's about 5 to 1.
If you look at the number of doctoral graduates from North America.
Another thing you just said,
Zhang Yiping just talked about the number of people in different regions.
I think there are very few people in Europe.
I guess there's a reason.
Maybe it's because their time is really not ideal.
In the United States and Taiwan, one in the evening, one in the morning.
The European time zone is 2 o'clock in the middle of the night.
That's really difficult.
So maybe it's a barrier.
Let me interrupt you.
I don't know if I can interrupt your point of view.
We are now chatting.
There are different people with different problems.
We will discuss one by one.
But let's finish the discussion now.
So everyone just wait patiently.
What I'm going to talk about next is about the topic.
How broad or narrow the topic is.
I guess what Zhang Yiping is going to tell me is about the same.
Because I don't think ...
First of all, I am Zhang Yiping.
I am studying social psychology.
So I guess I am ...
I'm not completely humanities.
But I should be relatively social science.
But from my point of view,
I don't think the current topic is too special.
The reason is ...
The reason is ...
I don't think ...
At least my understanding is that Tyra's goal is not to do science.
We are not TED.
So ...
And we didn't force everyone to attend many times.
So it seems that social science people have to sign up for a few things.
He obviously doesn't understand.
This is not ...
This is a free participation.
Then our goal is actually more professional.
This ...
Establish academic links with each other.
So it was originally a professional academic link.
If I see that topic, I don't know at all.
He wrote a few mathematical symbols on it.
Even this ...
The symbol of the physical example has nothing to do with me.
I just don't want to go.
On the contrary, such a more professional topic can actually help ...
The speaker and the audience will go to establish a link.
Instead of them talking ...
They ...
The speaker and the original professional audience feel very shallow.
They don't know what they are doing here.
Then I go ...
I finished listening.
I think it's very interesting.
But when I go home, it has nothing to do with my academics.
I think ...
I think it's more of a difference.
So I ...
I don't think the topic is too short now.
Let me talk about that ...
Zhang Jiaming just said.
That is ...
In fact, I think there is a point.
Just ...
Jason is not very correct.
That is, we can't control the speaker.
In fact, we are communicating with the speaker.
When is the speech?
How do we usually arrange a process?
How much time do you need to do the introduction?
How long does it take to talk about the professional part?
But ...
We ...
At least I personally ...
If I do it ...
I am doing some speeches.
If it's my field of chair.
I will tell them that ...
We hope it can really be in ...
Academically, it has enough impact on you.
That is to say ...
You can get a network that is useful to you.
Or a partner.
So if you come and give a ...
Like ...
If you give a speech like a YouTuber ...
It may make everyone feel very fruitful.
But in fact, for our organization ...
Or for ...
The impact we really want to have.
May not be the best.
Because you go ...
Yeah, it's TED Talk.
Just listen to TED Talk.
So I personally ...
Usually positioned in this part.
Then I will tell them that ...
What academic speech do you want to say?
You really let ...
This thing can be played.
That ...
He himself will not come.
We do not mind a speech.
Only ten people.
Or I do not mind.
But in fact, I know ...
Jason is actually more inclined to do ...
More ...
Interdisciplinary.
Or ...
More ...
Lighter.
But a wider speech.
Then I think this is a ...
Discussable direction.
That is to say ...
Everyone to our ...
What do you think of the scope?
This way.
I do not necessarily want to do ...
Lighter speech.
I hope that ...
That is ...
Speakers ...
In fact, you can ...
Spend ten to twenty minutes to talk about the background.
That is to say ...
His field ...
That is ...
Current development ...
What is the current situation?
How?
That is ...
But later ...
He can say that ...
He ...
What is he really doing?
I would think ...
If this is the case ...
I think this is actually ...
A large part is the current situation.
Is not it?
I think ...
If this is the case, I think ...
I quite agree.
I think ...
Sure.
If you really want to produce this ...
Cross-field cooperation ...
You do not tell people ...
You are in ...
What is your big picture?
In fact, it is very ...
It is a hindrance.
So I think ...
This ...
Yes.
But there is ...
I think ...
The audience just said ...
A good point is that ...
This is your name ...
It can be better.
You can write better.
Yes, I think my ...
My idea should just say ...
Because you just discussed ...
How to let ...
Some ...
Different audiences ...
Participate.
Maybe I did not hear very clearly.
But I just want to say ...
Maybe you can ...
How to attract people.
So I just feel from ...
Title or ...
Advertising ...
You can attract people.
Because ...
Maybe you have discussed the content ...
Background.
But because I ...
I do not know these things.
Yes.
OK.
Yes.
I think his meaning should be like this.
That is ...
We should be advertising ...
Promotion.
Or ...
Title should be at least ...
Clear.
Clear.
And I think ...
I do not know if this is too much trouble.
But I think maybe ...
Can be divided a little bit.
Because like now ...
Someone mentioned ...
I just mentioned that ...
We can be divided into areas.
Or ...
But I think maybe ...
You can be divided a little bit.
There are some talks ...
Maybe some ...
Speakers would like to talk ...
General ...
A little bit.
Or more ...
Background part.
Some of them may be ...
More professional ...
Want to discuss with each other.
But I think ...
This may be a little bit ...
To distinguish.
This may also be helpful ...
To digest ...
That is ...
Speech requirements.
I ...
I ...
I want to follow this suggestion.
My own position is more like ...
Leave this freedom to the speaker.
Let me give an example.
Like ...
Uh ...
The freedom I'm talking about is ...
How deep, how much money, how much money.
This freedom.
Let me give an example.
Suppose I am doing this today.
Quantum computing.
Then I did it very well.
I am ...
I am Zhang Taide.
I am very professional.
I am very good.
Then I'm going to find another one.
With me ...
To ...
This ...
Co-PI of a ...
I am now looking for a co-PI.
Then do a very professional thing.
So I talked about a very professional speech.
I wrote a very professional title.
Others do not understand.
Is ...
They just go to die.
This is my freedom.
Then my goal is ...
This way.
Then I also do this.
I also achieved.
I actually feel that there is no problem.
But suppose I am doing today.
Quantum computing.
Then I want to go to the TSMC to ask for money.
This way.
Then I obviously can not write ...
Such a title.
So I will ...
Uh ...
I ...
I predict who the audience is.
So I wrote a relatively clear title.
Then focus on not so much math.
Maybe not so much math.
Then write some ...
The future possibilities of these.
Then I may even be ...
Write Chinese, etc.
So I will be more inclined to ...
Uh ...
The speaker ...
I think this is the responsibility of the speaker.
They ...
Want to know their own ...
Predict the audience.
Who do they want the audience to be?
Then go ...
Cooperate with the audience.
Control their depth.
Achieve the goal they want to achieve.
I will be more inclined to ...
Leave this part to the speaker.
Then if you really want the speaker ...
There is no no.
Yeah, I ...
I fully understand you.
I mean ...
The speaker can of course decide for himself.
But it should be said ...
Maybe your platform can ...
Is that you can ...
Maybe on the website.
Or what can you say?
Oh, we have ...
These ...
That is, we may ...
You can give these ...
Types of ...
That ...
Speech.
Then you can ...
Just think about it.
Which part are you more inclined to?
That ...
You can tell us first.
Then we are doing advertising.
Or in classification.
Or when arranging.
We are more able to ...
Just ...
Help you classify well.
Or help you promote.
Of course there is a speaker.
Decide for yourself first.
What type does he want to give you?
It's not that we ...
I did not say what to ask the speaker to give.
Just say you are probably ...
Just in advertising.
Or classification.
Or just ...
When giving everyone options.
Just say, oh, we have these choices.
This feeling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ok.
Understand.
This may be in the future.
Just ...
To the speaker's ...
Uh ...
Instructions.
Yeah.
Because I was thinking ...
You just ...
Yeah.
You just said ...
Maybe you want to classify or classify.
Then I just want to say ...
This may be ...
Just ...
You can try it.
Just ...
Because I have participated in it.
I'm not sure.
No, no.
I think this suggestion is very good.
Just ...
I think we might have to think about it.
Is ...
Sure.
Our speech content.
There is probably no problem.
This is the 20-minute, 40-minute distribution.
Then the depth of distribution.
But we are ...
Let others see this.
When people see this announcement.
Unless you are really doing that thing.
Or you will not know.
What is this doing?
That is either.
We can make the speech.
The title can be set.
It is easier to understand.
Otherwise, we are.
We, for example, Facebook.
That article in the post.
There should be one.
For example,
What kind of this is.
Or say this thing.
One word clearly said.
What is this doing?
This is so that you can know.
I think this may have to think about it later.
I think this may have to think about it later.
I think this may have to think about it later.
I think this may have to think about it later.
I wrote it down.
End of discussion.
We can write a difficulty index.
1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars.
Then every time.
That is, you know.
1 star is a textbook speech.
5 stars.
You may have to do academic discussion.
You may have to do academic discussion.
We can have one like this.
We can have one like this.
Logo.
What is the type.
OK.
That was Zhang Yan-yong.
That was Zhang Yan-yong.
I am not sure.
I am not sure.
There is no.
It's me.
But I was just...
But I was just...
Settings.
I finished.
I finished.
I finished.
And then...
Er...
So I think just now,
The summary of Zhang Yan-yong is good.
In fact, when I think Tyra can be in this sense later on,

A lot of people will likely have the same levels of corruption studies.

The development of your career may be similar at that age.
The development of your career may be similar at that age.
That's probably what I am talking about.
Well that's the answer to your question.
Last time when I was looking for a job as a novice professor
I found that most of the professors are very active.
But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.
But I don't know if they are active when I am in a deeper speech.
Or maybe they are not participating.
I found that they may have been doctors at that time.
I found that they may have been doctors at that time.
But they are now in the workplace.
Their contribution and their needs are different.
But we didn't follow them or update them.
But we didn't follow them or update them.
When we want to find a partner,
we can't find them.
Another thing I want to mention is the scope.
In public health,
there is a committee of North American public health scholars.
The committee is very detailed.
We have a group about health policy on Facebook.
We have a group about health policy on Facebook.
If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,
If the members are willing to work with other professional groups,
it will increase the scope of their work.
But now I heard that the speech is all about science and technology.
I participated in a few times.
I participated in a few times.
I really don't understand other things.
I really don't understand other things.
Who are you and what are you doing?
Who are you and what are you doing?
Who are you and what are you doing?
I don't think there is a way.
If your profession has a special organization
that has been established for a long time
and has developed into a good platform,
I don't think we need to recruit people like that.
I don't think we need to recruit people like that.
We can find a Taiwanese public service organization in North America
and hold a speech with them.
I think this is the best way to cooperate.
For public service scholars,
they can speak on our platform.
They can speak to non-public service people.
They can speak to non-public service people.
In this way, they may be able to reach people
they usually can't reach.
I think this is a way to cooperate.
I think I can only agree with this.
I just want to say
in our administrative experience,
in fact,
I know there is a Taiwanese Biological Society in Boston.
They are in South California now.
They are in San Diego.
Professional societies like this
have contacted us.
There are also other societies
that are similar to Taiwanese
in certain academic fields overseas.
Many of them have contacted us.
We do want to cooperate with them.
We are also very welcome
if there is a practical plan
to discuss with us
or if you are interested in joining the staff.
Because we don't have a lot of people.
This is also a problem.
Another problem is that
we are thinking about how to do it better.
If you have any opinion,
we are very welcome.
Obviously, everyone has this idea.
We also have this idea.
This is a good suggestion.
I don't know what you think.
Otherwise, we can go through the questions.
I have a small question.
Everyone,
for our actual system experience,
what I want to ask is
if you join the membership,
we will add you to the list of members.
All the members are on the list.
We will send out all the emails
using the mailing list.
Basically, everyone will receive all the messages.
I know that for many people,
this is not the best way.
Some people may only want to receive
the membership information.
They don't want to receive
a speech announcement every week.
Some people only want to receive
the speech announcement.
They don't want you to contact them
to update their rights.
Whatever.
I can accept it anyway.
I just want to know the speech information.
Some people only want to receive
the information like
where the job openings are,
or where people are competing.
This kind of information.
For this more detailed system operation,
I don't know how your experience is,
or what kind of changes you want to see,
or what kind of upgrades you want to see.
Do you have any opinions?
Or share your feelings.
Zhang Anping said,
you want to classify the mailing list
into several themes.
Is that what you mean?
This may be a way.
But how do you actually do it?
Does anyone have similar experience?
Or a better suggestion?
You can share.
I don't know how to do it backstage.
But I think the front desk part
seems to have a lot of websites
that say you go in
and there are several different themes
of newsletters you can book.
Then you tick what you want.
It's like this.
I think we have a little bit like this now.
Because the main list of staff
and the members are actually separate.
So for me,
there are already two options.
I can tick both.
That kind of feeling.
I don't know how to do it backstage.
Or you can divide it by frequency.
For example,
the type of work,
maybe several times a month.
Or the type of speech,
several times a month.
By frequency.
What you said is
a pretty interesting idea.
In fact, this idea is like
you subscribe to some main list.
Then you can say,
don't send it to me.
You help me monthly digest.
Then send it all to me.
Similar concept, right?
OK.
Let me write it down.
Are we talking about the same thing?
You go ahead.
Just now, Lin Gaoxian
left a comment in the chat.
He said,
is it possible to divide the members into areas?
Then each group has a person to gather.
Each person gathers to give a speech.
Each group may have
different areas at the same time.
It can consume a lot of speech demand.
This feels a bit like
the question just now.
That is to say,
we have to divide into different areas.
Then each create a group.
In fact,
this is what we have thought about
in the staff part.
There is a problem.
For example,
every week,
from carrying one speech
to carrying two speeches,
the number of staff we basically need
is to first order to multiply by 2.
But we don't have enough people.
This is a problem.
But
we have recruited new staff this year.
If new staff are interested
in this direction
to produce such a project,
we can try it.
I think we can try it.
I am optimistic.
There is nothing wrong with it.
The actual details may be
what the staff
might want to do
when arranging it.
This is a good suggestion.
I think most of the suggestions
are similar to this.
There is a guest
who said
there is a
e-news platform.
I clicked on it.
He said
MailChimp.
I know this.
It can help you make e-news.
You Zhen is our IT team.
She said
thank you for considering this platform.
Let me add something.
I actually quite like this platform.
But because
currently we
discussed it before.
We hope
the new staff
can
see the previous
work opportunities
or
the speech
announced this week
but it hasn't happened yet.
This kind of information.
Something like this.
You can look back.
That's why we want to use
Google Groups.
It can be like
you can see the website.
There is a website interface.
You can receive it
from e-mail.
That's why we consider this.
MailChimp
is an e-news platform.
So we can't do this.
This is the reason
we don't consider it.
But it is good management.
Thank you for your advice.
Does anyone have any questions
about logo?
Or does anyone want to...
Do we need a draft?
Pause.
Does anyone want to ask
where the Facebook logo came from?
Sorry.
This is my personal question.
You can explain.
When I
created it 2 years ago,
I thought
there is no logo now.
I should put my son's photo.
To protect his
portrait rights,
I didn't put my son's photo.
It's okay.
What do you think
about logo?
I think
we should
see
if there is
a person who is good at
art.
If there is,
we can create our logo.
I don't think
there is
any
opinion.
I don't think
there is much opinion.
Okay.
Does anyone
have any
questions?
If you don't,
let's move on
to the next part.
Okay.
Let's
stop
the Q&A
part.
Okay?
Next,
let's talk about
Project Hira.
We hope
there will be
new people
joining us
next year.
Next,
let's move on
to the recruitment.
Okay.
Basically,
we hope
we can
find
some
new people
to recruit.
We hope
we can
find
some people
from
the past
to join us.
We hope
we can
find
more people
to join us.
Next,
let's move on
to the
hiring.
We hope
we can
find
more people
to join us.
We also
hope
we can
find
more people
to join us.
We also
hope
we can
find
more people
to join us.
Next,
we have

We
have
a
new
team
for
hiring.

a
new
team

a
new
team
for
hiring.
We

a
new
team
for
conversations
with

development
and
develop
communication
skills.
And
the most
important
thing
is
to
fill out
the form.
We will
contact you
when we
receive your
information.
There are
four
groups in
Taira.
Membership,
PR,
public
relations,
seminar,
and
email.
PR

promote
the
conference
on
Facebook
and
social media.
They
will
make sure
we have
enough
funds
and
contact
potential
partners.

organize
activities

the
blog

research
new

of
talent
your
group
needs.
I'm
the
seminar
group
leader.
We
need to
organize

experience
with
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
HTML will
be the
best.
And
then...
other
daily work

the
audience.
So
we have
IT
to
organize
the
data
and
submit
it to
the
seminar
team.
And
then...
we have
a
meeting
room
and
a
guide.
So

So
in
this
communal
conference,
we
try to
capture
what
is
happening
with
different
problems
and
what
we
have
to
talk about
in
that
series
Okay,
then
next is the last
is about
these above
speeches
above
reports
there is no problem
and
in fact
I think we can
invite those who
have come to sign up
a little
out of the sound
can we
actually
we
that application form
before sending out
some people have already
come to fill in
it
do not be so
silent it
is that I believe
now participate in
more than 20 people
there should be a lot of
people who have
already filled in
before this meeting
to join the
staff
right
I can
I can
say that
you are already
a staff
so
I'm not
you are not
sorry
sorry
I'm
really
the first time
to participate in
this meeting
I was just
two weeks
before the
association
gave the
job
seminar
when I
knew
your association
and then I
went online
to see
and then fill in
that form
but
this is really
my first time
to join
so I
actually
have no experience
and then
I have not heard
any of your
seminars
but
now
I can
introduce myself
is that
I have been
at home
during the pandemic
so
I started
to look at
these things
and I'm quite
interested in
joining
if there is a
chance
oh
ok
ok
welcome
then
which
aspect
are you doing
I am doing
my own background
is a graduate
of the
atmosphere
so I
am doing
some research
on climate
so
I am
a graduate
of the
science
so you
may know
Wei
I know
him
he is
here
now
ok
that's
about it
chat
chat
someone
ask
you
do you
know
Chen
Xin
we are
from the
same
class
he
is
my
classmate
but we
don't
know each
other
ok
I am
surprised
that
if
everyone
heard
what we
said
are
all
the
participants
not
already
registered
staff
if
they
are
basically
we
are
an
internal
meeting
from
here
so
everyone
don't
be shy
just
open the
mic
and
say
anything
get to
know
each
other
hi
everyone
wait
is there
a
response
sorry
hi
can you
hear
me
yes
ok
my
name
is
Huang
Yi
Ting
I
attended
a
lecture
last
time
that
was
my
first
project
IRA
talk
I
haven't
signed up
yet
but
I
have a
meeting
in
an
hour
and
some other
work
that
needs
to be
done
I
attended
some
volunteer
organizations
in
Boston
called
Philosophy
Friday
I
echo
what
we
said
I
hope
that
the
theme can
be
heard
by
everyone
I
agree
it
is up
to the
speaker
to
decide
what
to
do
one
of the
reasons
I
can't
sign up
is
I
have
a
meeting
every
week
I
want to
ask
if
the
organization
wants
volunteers
to be
volunteers
they
need
to
have
meetings
every
week
I
can
understand
that
everyone
needs
to
work
together
I
hope

the
organization
wants
volunteers
to be
volunteers
