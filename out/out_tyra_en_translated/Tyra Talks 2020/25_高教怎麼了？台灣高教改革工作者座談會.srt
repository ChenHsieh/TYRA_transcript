00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the summer special series activities of Taira at the end of September.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This year's summer special series activities are a bit long. We will actually extend it to October.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today's topic is called, what's wrong with high-profile, high-profile reform workers forum.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are very honored to invite three speakers from different perspectives and fields to talk about high-profile reform for a long time.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The first thing I want to do is to introduce our speakers to you.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Our first speaker is Dr. Chen Xiaoyu. He is currently a vice-researcher at the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy Research and Information Center.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He is also a member of the Taiwan High-Level Educational Industry Association.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The second speaker is Dr. Xu Ruifu. He is currently a doctoral student at the Taiwan University Telecommunications Institute.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He was the president of the former Taiwan University Graduate Association.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
At the same time, he is also a youth consultant member of the Executive Yuan.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He has been very active in participating in high-profile reform, especially from a student's point of view.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The third speaker is Dr. Xie Ruizhe.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But we may not call him that today.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because everyone is used to calling him Zha Shi.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So we may also call him Zha Shi.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You can also call him that.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He is now the policy assistant of the Legislative Yuan Educational and Cultural Committee.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So he can also bring you different points of view in this regard.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will not mention it again today.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But let me talk about it first.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Today's three speakers, their bosses are very willing to let them share.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But based on their experience, they will speak on behalf of themselves.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I will talk about it for them.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So this is what we are going to do today.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We will invite the three speakers to talk about how they view the issue of high-profile reform.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Then we can start discussing from what they have said.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's start with Xiaoyu.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How do you view this issue?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay. I am Xiaoyu Chen.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you for the invitation.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And thank you to the other two speakers, Ruizhe and Zha Shi, for their participation.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When it comes to high-profile reform,

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I dare not say that I have been involved in reform for many years.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I basically want to share some observations on high-level education.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My interest in research is mainly high-level education.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I also read this in my class.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The topic I want to talk about today is about high-level talents.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you have seen my Facebook page,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
which is LaoYuNanJie,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I have a fan page.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I often write on it that Taiwan issues are global issues.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But we also have different domestic issues that need to be discussed.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I cut from three perspectives of human resources management.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The first is the part about talent selection.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In fact, my country's current problem of doctoral education,

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I personally think that it is not that no one reads doctoral classes,

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but that excellent talents are not willing to read doctoral classes.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That is the problem of our country.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay. This is the part about talent selection.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Everyone can discuss this later.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
From the part about the budget and the budget flow,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I personally think that there are two things,

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
some things are worth discussing.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The first is the talent selection.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The first is the part about doctoral education.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What kind of doctoral education do we provide in China?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do we treat everyone as paper machines,

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
lab workers,

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
or do we really need to train people to solve problems?

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And then in the future,

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I hope that the industry or the academic world

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
will develop more and more.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think this is a very important issue.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think this is a very important issue.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think this is a very important issue.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I hope that the industry or the academic world

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
will develop more and more.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I hope that the industry or the academic world

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
will develop more and more.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay. The other problem is the mechanism.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The mechanism will be discussed by the other two speakers.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I personally think there are two parts.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
One part is about the part about study abroad scholarship.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
One part is about the part about study abroad scholarship.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The related planning and distribution of the field

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is how to proceed.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The more serious problem for our domestic doctoral class

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is that at present

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the domestic doctoral class

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
only has the part about study abroad scholarship.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Whether you are a TA or an RA,

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the education of the doctoral class

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
does not have the so-called scholarship system.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In other words,

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we do not have the so-called fellowship.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The third part is

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
mainly about the flow of money.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The human resources management

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
likes to talk about the flow of money.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The part about the flow of money.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The part about the flow of money.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My personal opinion is that

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
whether you are a senior talent,

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
a doctoral talent,

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
an academic talent,

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
or an industrial talent,

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
in other words,

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
if you want to develop into the academic world

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
or the industry,

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
basically,

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the mechanism of the talent

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
is a part of the global flow.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Regardless of which university you graduate from,

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
or which direction you want to go in the future,

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
for example,

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
if you want to go to a foreign university

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
or research institution

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in the future,

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I suggest that

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
we should think about

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
how to cooperate internationally in the future

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and help these talents

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
to have a good development abroad.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you want to come back to China,

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
whether it is a university,

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
research institution,

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
or industry development,

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
in fact,

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we consider,

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
for example,

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
whether you apply for

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
a job in China,

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to be honest,

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
in my personal experience,

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
if you really come back to China

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and apply for a job in China

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
or do research,

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
of course money is a very important factor,

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
but money can never

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
solve all the problems.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In fact,

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
we need more related support,

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
for example,

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
for young scholars.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
In fact,

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
if you want to

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
enter the industry,

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
my personal opinion is that

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
in fact, there are many doctors in Taiwan

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and there are many questions related to

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Dr. Liu Lang.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Basically, if you can pass the doctorate exam,

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you basically have a certain

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
ability or a certain degree.

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My personal opinion is that

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
if you finish your doctorate,

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you have to have a bottom line,

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
which is to know that

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you may not be able to develop

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
as much as you want,

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but you have a lot of things you can do.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Like me,

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to be honest,

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I am a Ph.D.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
in the Department of Philosophy

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
at the National University of Private University.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
To be honest,

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
we are the weakest group.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I graduated from the Department of Literature

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and then I studied a doctorate,

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but after I graduated,

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I found that I could not

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
engage in teaching at all.

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Even when I was laid off

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
from school for a while,

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I was thinking that

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
there was no other possibility.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So my friends called me

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
a truck driver.

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have a driver's license

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
in Taiwan.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In other words,

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
if the school or my legal agency

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
doesn't want me,

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I can find it the next day

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and I can drive a bus right away.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We often joke that

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
the school or my legal agency

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
doesn't want me

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because my colleagues

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
don't want me to hurt passers-by.

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is my report.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you.

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let me summarize a little bit.

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
As Xiaoyu mentioned,

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Taiwan has talented people,

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
but it seems that

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
there are very few people

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
who are willing to be a Ph.D.

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Also,

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Taiwan is obviously

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
without a Ph.D. system.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Thirdly,

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we either have talented people

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
or they don't come back.

198
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It seems that

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
somehow we don't have such a balance

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
to achieve such a fluid balance.

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We can discuss this later.

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Before we discuss,

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
let's change the order.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
As Xiaoyu and Ruifu

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
just introduced,

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
let's have Zha Shi

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to talk about

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the reform of higher education.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Can you hear me?

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm Zha Shi.

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Today, I'm going to

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
talk about something

214
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
that I don't understand.

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
After all, the Legislative Yuan

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
has to supervise the education committee

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
for a long time,

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
so I think the government

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
should do more.

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What are these actions?

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Today's audience

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
has a different point of view.

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
From the beginning,

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think the talent cultivation,

225
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the ability to retain talents,

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and the ability to retain talents

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
is a national security strategy.

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think everyone can accept this.

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We all think

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
this is a national strategy,

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but if more and more people

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
in Taiwan are missing

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
or unwilling to be a Ph.D.,

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
this is definitely a national security crisis.

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
From this perspective,

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
starting with the local Ph.D.,

237
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
we have indeed encountered

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
a lot of situations and problems.

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But let's start

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
with a big vision.

241
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If Taiwan wants to be

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
a country with international competitiveness

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and global competitiveness,

244
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
first of all, our local Ph.D. students

245
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
like Xiaoyu said,

246
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
these excellent Ph.D. students are not willing to study.

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is definitely the first part of the problem

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
that we have to solve.

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
In fact, talents are not only

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
local talents, international talents,

251
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and overseas talents

252
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
like you.

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Can Taiwan do this?

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because we have been dealing with

255
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
an overseas study and

256
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
international education specialization.

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is related to

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
international education specialization.

259
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
To echo what Xiaoyu said,

260
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
many of our Ph.D. students

261
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
have a healthy

262
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
education plan system overseas.

263
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This part allows us to

264
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
recruit more international students

265
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
in Taiwan.

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We focus on Ph.D. students.

267
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They have more planning resources

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to go to the world

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to have more international experience,

270
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
more international education experience.

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But for Taiwan,

272
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the last piece of the puzzle

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
is the new economic immigration law

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that we did not finish

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
in the 9th session of the last meeting.

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is actually a lot of pieces.

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Starting with local Ph.D. training,

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
this is very important.

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because I believe that many

280
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
academic professors

281
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
will have this goal

282
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
in the end.

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So local Ph.D. training

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
is very important.

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But in terms of international flow,

286
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
do we have such a healthy

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
international education

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
that allows everyone to

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
communicate internationally?

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In the end, there is a very good

291
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
talent or flow policy,

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
which is our new economic immigration law.

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We have been following it recently.

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I think this is a part of the

295
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
perspective to think about

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
every link is important.

297
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But although every link is important,

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I personally feel that

299
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
there is still very little

300
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
discussion on local Ph.D. training.

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
For me,

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
a local Ph.D. training

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
needs to have many important aspects.

304
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The first is economic support.

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We just talked about

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
a lot of Ph.D. students

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
have to get a two- or three-year Ph.D.

308
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and have to work outside

309
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to complete their research.

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is the first economic support.

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Next,

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
is there a good training plan?

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Whether it is in China,

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
there can be better

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
forward-looking academic research

316
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
or production planning

317
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
or to become a more practical Ph.D.

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is the second piece

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that I think is very important.

320
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The third piece is entry.

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Whether it is to become

322
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
a forward-looking academic or a practical Ph.D.,

323
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
what is the government's

324
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
thinking in Taiwan?

325
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think this is an interesting part

326
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that can be discussed.

327
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
From the government's point of view,

328
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
we have to deal with these things.

329
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But which role in the government

330
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
is the most qualified

331
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and should play

332
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
such a role?

333
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In fact, what we see now is

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that the national integration is very bad.

335
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
How do I put it?

336
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For example, the Ministry of Education.

337
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Of course, everyone will think that

338
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
all the questions we just talked about

339
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
are the Ministry of Education.

340
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It has a huge responsibility.

341
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But for the Ministry of Technology,

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it also has a very important

343
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
responsibility to train

344
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
these senior talents

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
as a research talent.

346
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Is the Ministry of Economy important?

347
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If we are going to talk about

348
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the important support for industry transformation,

349
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
is it important for the

350
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
connection between enterprises?

351
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It is very important.

352
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Next is the Ministry of Labor.

353
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
For these young graduates,

354
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
do they have a better way

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
to help them?

356
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So we can actually know that

357
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
the issue of talent training

358
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
actually has a certain responsibility

359
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
in different departments.

360
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Of course, the most important thing

361
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
is the Ministry of Education

362
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
When we do a lot of interviews,

363
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
we will find that the Ministry of Education

364
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
will do the Ministry of Education.

365
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The Ministry of Technology will do the Ministry of Technology.

366
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The connection between the ministries

367
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
is actually lacking.

368
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Let me give you an example.

369
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Last year, the Ministry of Technology

370
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
did an excellent doctoral student scholarship program.

371
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Simply put,

372
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it hopes to recruit many excellent talents

373
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
to Taiwan.

374
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
These students in Taiwan

375
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
are willing to study for a doctorate.

376
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The Ministry of Technology

377
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
will give them about $500,000.

378
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Of course, the Ministry of Technology

379
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
will cooperate with the universities.

380
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But the Ministry of Technology

381
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
will provide the greatest assistance

382
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
in economic support.

383
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This plan has been discussed for a long time.

384
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The Ministry of Technology

385
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
has been looking for the Ministry of Education

386
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
to cooperate.

387
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But in the end, the Ministry of Education

388
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
did not want to join.

389
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The Ministry of Technology

390
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
is more likely to join

391
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
than the Ministry of Education.

392
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The Ministry of Education

393
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is more likely to join

394
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
than the Ministry of Technology.

395
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The Ministry of Education

396
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
did not want to join.

397
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is a problem

398
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
that cannot be solved.

399
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Sometimes, it cannot be solved

400
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and it cannot cooperate.

401
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why?

402
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
In the Ministry of Education

403
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
or Ministry of Technology,

404
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the Ministry of Education

405
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
is a single unit

406
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
in the constitutional system.

407
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It has a budget

408
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and it has to implement these plans every year.

409
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The Ministry of Education

410
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and the Ministry of Technology

411
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
are equal and respect each other.

412
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Nobody can lead the other.

413
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This is an interesting discussion.

414
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In other countries,

415
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
the Ministry of Education

416
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and the Ministry of Technology

417
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
are tied together.

418
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When we do not have

419
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
a comprehensive strategy

420
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
for the country,

421
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the Ministry of Education

422
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
seems to have only completed half of the plan.

423
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The Ministry of Technology

424
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
seems to have only completed the other half.

425
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But can these two ministries cooperate?

426
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This is a big question mark.

427
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We will try to push them.

428
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But after all,

429
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Technology

430
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
have a strong fundamentalism.

431
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So many plans

432
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
will not meet.

433
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So I think

434
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
from the biggest point of view,

435
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I think the local

436
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
or international

437
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
or overseas talents

438
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
come back to Taiwan.

439
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This is what our government

440
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
needs to complete

441
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
through some legal procedures.

442
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But gradually,

443
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
in fact,

444
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
there are some problems

445
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
in the division of labor.

446
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The Ministry of Education

447
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
does not do this.

448
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is because it is called the Ministry of Labor

449
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
in the system.

450
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The Ministry of Labor has its own restrictions.

451
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So there is a lot of support

452
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
that has been talking about

453
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
whether the Ministry of Education

454
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and the Ministry of Technology

455
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
can be combined.

456
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Or is there a higher unit,

457
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
such as the National Development Committee?

458
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This kind of high-level ministry

459
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
can do the integration of the ministries.

460
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The plan of the ministries

461
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
really has its similarities.

462
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Where is the integration?

463
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How to do it?

464
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I think this is a very interesting part.

465
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So from the point of view

466
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
of government supervision,

467
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
this is probably the part I mentioned today.

468
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Thank you.

469
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think this is very interesting.

470
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That is to say,

471
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
let's find another person

472
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
to talk to you.

473
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's ask Ralph to talk about it.

474
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He used to be the president

475
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
of the Taiwan University Graduate Association.

476
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Then he was a youth consultant

477
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
at the Executive Yuan.

478
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Of course, now he is also a PhD student

479
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
doing TA and receiving scholarships.

480
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ralph, what do you think?

481
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What is your opinion?

482
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let me post my Facebook first.

483
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can talk to me later.

484
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Because I often

485
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
write articles or have some new plans.

486
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If I have a chance,

487
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I would like to find everyone to do it together.

488
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Let me briefly talk about

489
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
the whole process and the path of participation.

490
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There may be more issues

491
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
to be discussed later.

492
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think this experience is very important.

493
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Because I have always been

494
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
participating from a student's point of view.

495
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Then I saw the first line of the problem

496
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and thought about how to change it.

497
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I started to participate

498
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in 2016.

499
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
At that time, I was recommended

500
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to join the Executive Yuan Youth Consultation Committee.

501
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why is there this organization?

502
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It is because

503
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
in 2014,

504
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
after the Taiyanghua School,

505
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the government slowly realized

506
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that the voice of the youth is very important.

507
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
In addition to social movements,

508
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the government

509
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
established a youth consultation committee

510
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and held a public election.

511
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Later, after Tsai Ing-wen came to power,

512
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
she slightly changed her approach.

513
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Because they felt that

514
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
many of the youth consultants

515
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
wanted to directly participate in politics and elections.

516
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They felt that this approach

517
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
was not OK.

518
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
In practice, they became conservative.

519
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They changed their approach

520
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to let the officials of the committee recommend them.

521
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Of course, the recommended candidates

522
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
are conservative,

523
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
but there are also some more advanced candidates.

524
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So in practice,

525
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
it is more like

526
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
the committee has some policies that have been implemented.

527
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then you can make some amendments on it.

528
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
In fact, it is not possible

529
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
for example, at that time,

530
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
you can take any action.

531
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
At that time,

532
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I was in office for two years.

533
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It happened to be the time when

534
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
my research institute was in its first year.

535
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I proposed two proposals.

536
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It happened to be in the office of Lin Quan and Lai Ching-teh.

537
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
One of the proposals

538
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
was aimed at

539
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
some of the problems

540
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
in TA.

541
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
After the proposal,

542
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
the problem was not solved.

543
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The second proposal

544
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
happened to be the opportunity

545
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
for UCLA scholars

546
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to visit us.

547
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think the cooperation experience

548
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
of international research and academic exchange

549
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
is very important for an academic talent.

550
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I asked

551
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
if we should encourage more scholars

552
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
in our research institute.

553
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Maybe it's not just a collaboration

554
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
with the teacher.

555
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It is to let students have more research experience

556
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and expand their international vision.

557
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There are also some opportunities for international development.

558
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Although the proposal was approved,

559
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
the result was not ideal.

560
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The reason is that

561
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
about 80% to 90% of the content

562
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
was written

563
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
by the Ministry of Science and Technology

564
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and the Ministry of Education.

565
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They wrote an article

566
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and replied to me.

567
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The result of not communicating

568
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
is more like

569
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
you not only need to know

570
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
what they have done

571
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
in advance,

572
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
but also need to point out

573
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
which part of what they have done

574
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
is problematic

575
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and they are willing to accept

576
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
what you have said.

577
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's not just that you may see

578
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
a problem from the outside

579
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and think how to solve it

580
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
would be better.

581
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Next, I will talk about the second part.

582
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In that period of time,

583
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I have a conclusion,

584
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
observation or summary.

585
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If a problem can be improved,

586
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
there may be three motivations

587
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
or three reasons.

588
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The first one is the government official.

589
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The government official is the minister,

590
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
so he may not be able to achieve

591
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
what he wants to do.

592
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But the will and choice of the government official

593
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
are very important.

594
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The second one is the civil society.

595
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The civil society is not only

596
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
publicizing information

597
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
or giving actual consultations.

598
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
For example,

599
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Xiao Yu and Zha Shi

600
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
are the representatives of the civil society.

601
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The pressure of the civil society

602
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
should be combined

603
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
through private meetings

604
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
or public speeches

605
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
to make people pay more attention.

606
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This is also a very important way.

607
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
After that,

608
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I had no choice

609
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but to choose

610
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
the president of the Taiwan University Research Association.

611
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In the position of president,

612
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I have done

613
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
two things

614
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
for the Taiwan University Research Association.

615
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
First,

616
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I had a meeting with the president

617
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
of the Taiwan University Research Association

618
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and the director of the Ministry of Education

619
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
to discuss the improvement

620
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
of the student's treatment.

621
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In fact,

622
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the meeting was not very pleasant.

623
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
At that time,

624
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
we raised some issues

625
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
that we observed.

626
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
At that time,

627
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
we were not mature enough

628
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to point out what he did wrong

629
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and figure out how to solve the problem

630
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and convince him.

631
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We were not mature enough.

632
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
However,

633
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
some senior officials asked us

634
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that if doctors

635
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
are unemployed

636
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and unable to work,

637
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
we can easily invest more resources

638
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
instead of causing more unemployment.

639
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Secondly,

640
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
how to convince the society

641
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
to invest more social resources

642
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
is really valuable.

643
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Therefore,

644
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
the meeting was not pleasant.

645
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
At that time,

646
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I observed

647
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
how to promote

648
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the change of policy

649
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
to reduce the pressure of public opinion.

650
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
In the field of doctors,

651
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
there was a gap.

652
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
In the past,

653
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
there were many issues

654
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
about the student's point of view

655
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
at the Taiwan University Research Association

656
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
However,

657
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the student's point of view

658
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
was always a problem.

659
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
For example,

660
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
the Taiwan University Research Association

661
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
had been promoting

662
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
the social movement

663
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
for 6 or 7 years

664
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
mainly for the employees

665
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
who had been working hard.

666
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
They made a lot of efforts

667
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
but I think

668
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
what they did

669
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
was meaningful.

670
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
First of all,

671
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
it was hard to continue

672
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
their movement.

673
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Secondly,

674
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
the fundamental problem

675
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
was that the TA's salary

676
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
had not increased

677
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
from the 1930s to the present.

678
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So,

679
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
it was a basic salary

680
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
of a supermarket.

681
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This was a big problem.

682
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It was the investment of social resources

683
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
rather than the calculation

684
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Finally,

685
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
one of my goals

686
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
when I stay in Taiwan

687
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
is to improve the environment.

688
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
In the long run,

689
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I hope that

690
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
the TA's education level

691
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
can be similar

692
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
to the higher education system

693
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
in the world.

694
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No matter what,

695
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
it is important

696
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to fulfill the TA's point of view.

697
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
According to our professors,

698
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
we need good researchers

699
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and local academic development.

700
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Whether it is academic development

701
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
or the development of industry,

702
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
we need these talents.

703
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So,

704
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
it is important to

705
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
achieve a balance.

706
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I am thinking about

707
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
organizing a national

708
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
TA's organization.

709
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I hope that

710
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
we can continue to

711
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
organize it.

712
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I will share more ideas with you later.

713
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank you.

714
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
After hearing

715
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
the three

716
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
TA's statements,

717
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
we can hear

718
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
a clear

719
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
point of view.

720
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Everyone mentioned

721
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
what is the role of a doctor?

722
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What is the value of

723
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
cultivating these high-level talents?

724
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If we understand it,

725
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
can we discuss

726
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
how to do it?

727
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Then, the TA's

728
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
mentioned the resources.

729
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
After having the resources,

730
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
how can we

731
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
implement the policy?

732
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Can we start from the beginning?

733
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I will ask the three

734
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
TA's questions.

735
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What do you think

736
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the role of cultivating

737
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
these high-level talents

738
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
should be?

739
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What is our

740
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
imagination?

741
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Does anyone want to volunteer?

742
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Sorry,

743
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
you can also

744
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
ask questions in the chat.

745
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Let's go back

746
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
to the question.

747
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I saw that

748
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Xiao-Yu typed something.

749
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Xiao-Yu, why don't you go first?

750
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Not everyone can read the chat.

751
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
For example,

752
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
what do you think

753
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
the role of cultivating

754
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
these high-level talents

755
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
should be?

756
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This is a difficult question.

757
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I will go first.

758
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Please.

759
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Actually,

760
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
this question is also

761
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
to thank Zha Shi

762
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
after I graduated.

763
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
At that time,

764
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I met him and he was

765
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
a professor.

766
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I always felt that

767
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Taiwan did not have a

768
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
continuous discussion

769
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
of high-level policy

770
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and the power of continuous development.

771
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Whether it was a group of French

772
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
or a political group

773
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
or various units.

774
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
At that time,

775
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I met the biggest difficulty.

776
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
For example,

777
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I was a doctor at

778
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
the University of Taiwan.

779
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The power of continuous development

780
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and innovation and transformation.

781
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But this is not the case

782
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
in other fields.

783
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because the industrial development

784
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
is not the same

785
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
or there is no industry at all.

786
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
After I graduated from the master's class,

787
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I did one thing.

788
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I classified the three academic subjects

789
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
of the Department of Humanities and Social Science

790
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
in the Ministry of Education.

791
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Then I found

792
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the professors in these three fields.

793
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
According to their status,

794
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
they regularly

795
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
come to the Legislative Yuan

796
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
to discuss the direction

797
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
of policy development.

798
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So this is really a more

799
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
top-level issue.

800
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But I think

801
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
the other aspect of my talk

802
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
is that for this issue,

803
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
it is easy to limit

804
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
one's own learning experience

805
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and one's own professional field.

806
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So it becomes

807
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
more ideal

808
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
to have a more

809
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
top-level policy

810
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
of coordination and integration.

811
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So I didn't directly answer this question,

812
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
but I just gave feedback on the other aspect.

813
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Do you have any comments?

814
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The other two.

815
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Let me mention

816
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
because the Legislative Yuan

817
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
is held twice a year

818
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
in Taiwan.

819
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Once is from February to May.

820
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Once is from September to

821
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
the end of December.

822
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This meeting is also called

823
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
the Budget Meeting of Taiwan.

824
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
We will start to review

825
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the entire budget

826
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
proposed by the ministries

827
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
as a role of the Legislative Yuan.

828
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So we normally have

829
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
a lot of discussions

830
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
with the Ministry of Education

831
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
about the budget report.

832
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
In this budget report,

833
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
all the ministers sit at the bottom.

834
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
In fact, I also asked directly.

835
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This may be a very difficult question

836
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and there is no standard answer.

837
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What kind of talents

838
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
do we need to cultivate?

839
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Is it a food type

840
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
or is it a front-line teacher?

841
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What do we need to cultivate?

842
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
OK, then the head of the faculty

843
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
will talk first.

844
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
He said that as a main unit

845
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
of the faculty education,

846
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
we certainly hope that our faculty university

847
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
is a type of application

848
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
study.

849
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Of course, if you want to study

850
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
a doctor,

851
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
we hope that they focus on

852
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
food type research.

853
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
OK, then the head of the faculty

854
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
will talk next.

855
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We also know that

856
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
this is also a different faction.

857
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Some people think that

858
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
it is a research faction and

859
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
some people think that

860
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
it is a food faction.

861
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
There are a lot of people

862
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
talking about this.

863
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I myself am a lecturer

864
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
at the Institute of Electrical Engineering

865
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
with a background in technology.

866
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So I also know that

867
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
today we are going to talk about

868
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
going to the workplace

869
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and helping food companies.

870
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This matter actually makes a lot of sense.

871
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
However, it is also because of the

872
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
many meetings we held together

873
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
at the University of瑞福,

874
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
we began to understand that

875
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
the doctoral students in the

876
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
humanities group and the social group

877
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
are completely different,

878
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
even none.

879
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
In this situation,

880
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
it is difficult for me to say

881
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
that I have always used the point of view

882
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
of technology.

883
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
In fact, it should be said

884
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
that from the point of view of the

885
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
government, I think that

886
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
it should be more responsible

887
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
to break down the humanities,

888
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
social science and technology,

889
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
even if the three groups are divided.

890
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
In fact, the different departments

891
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
are in technology.

892
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
For example, ecology,

893
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
one is a doctor of ecology,

894
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and ecology and biology are completely different.

895
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
In fact, although it is just

896
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
such a standard under a big theme,

897
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
in fact, there are many

898
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
differences in each group.

899
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So in fact, my own feeling is

900
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
that the government must have

901
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
sufficient height and policy resources.

902
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It can go to the face.

903
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The most ideal, of course,

904
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
is the science department in each field.

905
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
How much is the academic demand

906
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
at the academic end?

907
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Will there be an industrial demand?

908
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
If these are all there,

909
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
it should be put back to the front end of education.

910
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
How do we do

911
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
a policy of recruiting students?

912
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And of course, the other

913
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
part of the ideal is that for each student,

914
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I believe that there must be students

915
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
who want to enter the enterprise to do industrial transformation,

916
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
do more experience in food.

917
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
There will also be these academic

918
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
research goals.

919
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
In fact, I think from the perspective of students,

920
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
how can they choose more freely?

921
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Knowing that this choice

922
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
will have a job opportunity in the future,

923
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
but will there be a job opportunity?

924
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think the government

925
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
should take a

926
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
big responsibility to play.

927
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But now we see that

928
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
it's more passive.

929
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What do you use?

930
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'll cut your number

931
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
by less than the ratio of your recruitment.

932
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Or say that our country has a key industry.

933
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It seems that we want to develop these key industries,

934
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
so we come to add these positions.

935
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But I think the most fundamental problem

936
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
is that it still takes a lot of time.

937
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
In this part, the government

938
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
should make more efforts.

939
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The above is probably the case.

940
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What do you think, Xiaoyu?

941
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I think this is

942
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
a big problem.

943
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
In fact, this goes back to the policy.

944
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
In other words, is the high-level education

945
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
of our country a planned economy,

946
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
that is, government control,

947
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
or a free market?

948
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If it is the United States,

949
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
to be honest, the doctoral program

950
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
is a free market.

951
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
In other words,

952
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
only graduate schools

953
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
can offer doctoral programs.

954
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What kind of field or science

955
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
does the doctoral program provide?

956
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
In fact, it is mainly

957
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
dominated by various schools.

958
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
As for the job,

959
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
in my country,

960
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
we are actually under the control

961
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
of the Ministry of Education.

962
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
In this case,

963
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
what should we do?

964
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
How much should we do?

965
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This matter is worth considering.

966
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
In other words,

967
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
of course, if you are a doctor,

968
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
you mainly want to

969
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
follow the academic path,

970
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
or want to develop the industry.

971
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It is true that there are

972
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
social and scientific fields

973
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
that are not related

974
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
to the industry.

975
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But in fact,

976
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
we have a lot of things to do.

977
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So,

978
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
is the doctoral program

979
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
completely

980
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
aimed at the profession?

981
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Or is it

982
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
still a basic ability

983
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
or a more professional ability

984
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
to hope to

985
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
move towards

986
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
long-term development in the future?

987
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So,

988
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
this is actually

989
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
from a policy position.

990
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So,

991
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
what should we do?

992
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
To what extent should we do?

993
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Of course,

994
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I also admit that

995
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the relevant government,

996
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
whether it is the Ministry of Education,

997
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the Ministry of Science and Technology,

998
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
or other units,

999
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
to be honest,

1000
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
we are not fully equipped.

1001
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I actually heard you all say

1002
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
that first of all,

1003
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
there should be a policy

1004
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
that is above the current level

1005
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
of cross-departmental structure.

1006
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Or we should have a comprehensive strategy.

1007
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Let's put it this way.

1008
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And then to promote this strategy,

1009
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
there is a very important one.

1010
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What kind of product

1011
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
do we want to produce

1012
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to convince our government

1013
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
to carry out what kind of policy

1014
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and then what kind of resources

1015
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
do we need?

1016
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Do you have any practical ideas?

1017
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Of course, this is my ideal picture.

1018
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We can do this.

1019
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But do you have any experience?

1020
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Or do you have any

1021
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
actual proposals?

1022
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Or any countries

1023
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
have done this?

1024
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Or have you ever thought about it?

1025
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Or the government has actually done it,

1026
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
but people have no feeling about it.

1027
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Or in fact,

1028
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
do you have anything to share?

1029
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You are all very polite.

1030
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Otherwise,

1031
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
let's start from the previous order again.

1032
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Otherwise, let's go back to RAVE.

1033
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So your question is

1034
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
what are the more clear

1035
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
policies that have been proposed

1036
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
or what is the situation?

1037
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes.

1038
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Then I will use

1039
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
the experience of

1040
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
our recent meeting with

1041
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
the senior teacher to explain to you.

1042
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Because what we did this year

1043
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
was to go to the Legislative Yuan every month

1044
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
to have a meeting.

1045
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Then the professors of Humanities, Social Sciences and Technology

1046
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
made their own reports.

1047
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
After everyone discussed,

1048
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
the final conclusion was to

1049
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
integrate the opinions of the overall report.

1050
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
In the report at that time,

1051
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
the general direction was

1052
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
that the whole meeting

1053
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
lasted about one hour,

1054
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
almost two hours.

1055
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The meeting schedule can also be

1056
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
divided into several parts.

1057
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
In fact,

1058
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
we have just discussed

1059
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
several parts.

1060
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
For example,

1061
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I mentioned that

1062
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
last year,

1063
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
the Ministry of Science and Technology

1064
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
held a seminar on the

1065
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
talent improvement of doctors.

1066
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
At that time,

1067
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
there was a professor at

1068
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
the University of Jianqiao

1069
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
who was in charge of the

1070
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
training of researchers

1071
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
from policy execution

1072
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
to human resources.

1073
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
At that time,

1074
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I also mentioned that

1075
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
perhaps the Ministry of Education

1076
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
should provide more resources

1077
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
to establish a role

1078
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
like a research center

1079
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
if there is no difficulty

1080
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
in the implementation

1081
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
of this plan.

1082
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
He was thinking about

1083
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the continuity of these policies

1084
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
not only in the field of

1085
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
post-doctoral studies,

1086
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
but also in the development

1087
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
of the entire career of a doctor.

1088
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
On the other hand,

1089
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
doctors should have

1090
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
a basic knowledge system.

1091
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
For example,

1092
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
how did we explain to him

1093
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
that we have transferred

1094
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the current data

1095
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
to the professors of

1096
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
major universities in Taiwan

1097
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
every year,

1098
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and there are about

1099
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
1,200 people

1100
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
who are professionals

1101
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
in the field of

1102
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
post-doctoral studies,

1103
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
so you can think

1104
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
about the size of the market.

1105
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There are about 2,000

1106
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
new job opportunities.

1107
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Since these 2,000 people

1108
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
are important people

1109
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
in the Ministry of Education,

1110
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
let's say the employees

1111
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
of the Ministry of Education,

1112
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
so the Ministry of Education

1113
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
should have a basic

1114
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
education guarantee

1115
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
for these so-called

1116
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
educational staff,

1117
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
or you should have

1118
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
a basic environment.

1119
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
If you evaluate

1120
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
this number,

1121
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
there should be

1122
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
4,000 or 5,000

1123
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
new doctoral students

1124
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
every year,

1125
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
so you can

1126
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
say that if

1127
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
at least 1,000 people

1128
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
become professors every year,

1129
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
2,000 people are

1130
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
highly educated people,

1131
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
what kind of

1132
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
basic resources

1133
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
should these people

1134
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
be given?

1135
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
For example,

1136
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
there was a proposal

1137
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
that the former

1138
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Minister of

1139
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Administration and

1140
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
the Ministry of Education

1141
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
should have a basic

1142
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
education guarantee.

1143
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
If there are

1144
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
industrial development resources,

1145
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
it can be added

1146
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
to make it higher.

1147
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So when we see

1148
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
this proposal,

1149
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
even the Ministry of Education

1150
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
has already

1151
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
prepared to

1152
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
approve it.

1153
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
We think it is

1154
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
a good idea.

1155
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
However,

1156
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the proposal was

1157
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
stopped after

1158
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yalda left,

1159
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and it was not

1160
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
carried out.

1161
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Later,

1162
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
we had a meeting

1163
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
with the Ministry of Education,

1164
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
and they said

1165
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
they were afraid that

1166
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
if more resources were

1167
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
invested,

1168
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the proposal would be

1169
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
rejected.

1170
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Of course,

1171
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
we have some

1172
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
opinions,

1173
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and there are many

1174
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
other opinions.

1175
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
If you are more careful,

1176
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
you can refer to

1177
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the document.

1178
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
In my opinion,

1179
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
the bigger structure

1180
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
is like this.

1181
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I also found

1182
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
that when the president

1183
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
wants to do something,

1184
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
the Ministry of Education

1185
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
will send out the proposal

1186
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and write a version.

1187
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
For example,

1188
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
there is a 5 plus 2

1189
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
key industry policy

1190
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
in our country's

1191
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
industrial talent policy,

1192
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
and it is to investigate

1193
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
which talents are missing

1194
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
in the key industry.

1195
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We found that

1196
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the Ministry of Education

1197
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
did not even investigate

1198
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
how many PhDs are

1199
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
in the industry development

1200
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
or transformation,

1201
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
let alone the policy

1202
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and implementation.

1203
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
We think it is ridiculous.

1204
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
After our meeting with

1205
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
the Ministry of Education,

1206
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
they said that

1207
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
it is just a form,

1208
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and they did not

1209
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
investigate this.

1210
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
As mentioned earlier,

1211
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
the integration of all ministries

1212
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
is really difficult.

1213
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It requires specific

1214
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
inspections and changes.

1215
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Otherwise,

1216
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
there may be other channels.

1217
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Do you have anything

1218
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
to add?

1219
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Or do you want to comment?

1220
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Let me talk about it.

1221
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I am Zashi.

1222
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I mentioned a lot of

1223
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
specific policies

1224
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that we mentioned to the mayor.

1225
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
From my point of view,

1226
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
in recent years,

1227
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
everyone knows that

1228
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Taiwan's government,

1229
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
whether it is the Ministry of Technology

1230
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
or the Ministry of Education,

1231
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
has mentioned some

1232
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
international talent planning

1233
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
projects,

1234
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
such as Yushan Scholar,

1235
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Qianlima,

1236
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and so on.

1237
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
However,

1238
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
in recent years,

1239
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
the Ministry of Education

1240
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
has proposed

1241
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
these projects

1242
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
to the schools

1243
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
every year,

1244
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and the money

1245
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
will be allocated

1246
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
to each school.

1247
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
However,

1248
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
we started to

1249
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
focus on international talent

1250
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
because we need

1251
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
a good professor

1252
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
and a good teacher.

1253
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
If these teachers

1254
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
don't have good students,

1255
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
will the teacher

1256
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
really have a strong

1257
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
research motivation?

1258
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
This is what we see.

1259
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
These talent planning projects

1260
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
have already started,

1261
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
but how do you return

1262
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
these important talents

1263
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
to Taiwan?

1264
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
During the meeting with the

1265
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Minister of Education,

1266
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
we specifically mentioned

1267
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
that in recent years,

1268
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
these talent planning projects

1269
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
are aimed at

1270
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
increasing the salary of professors

1271
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
and teachers,

1272
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
but is it possible

1273
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
to create another project

1274
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
that is more friendly

1275
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
to students?

1276
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Our view is simple.

1277
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
If you have good teachers

1278
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and good students,

1279
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
it's meaningless

1280
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
if you don't have good professors.

1281
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The Ministry of Education

1282
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
is concerned about

1283
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
whether these projects

1284
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
will attract

1285
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
a large number of

1286
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
professors in the future.

1287
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
However,

1288
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
these projects

1289
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
are aimed at

1290
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
excellent professors.

1291
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
We fully agree with this.

1292
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
In my opinion,

1293
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
some things

1294
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
need to be adjusted

1295
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
from a small place.

1296
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
For example,

1297
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
we have been talking about

1298
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
the Doctor's Scholarship Program,

1299
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
the Ministry of Science and Technology's

1300
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Doctor's Scholarship Program.

1301
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I talked directly with the

1302
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Director of the Ministry of Science

1303
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and Technology.

1304
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I told him

1305
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
my thoughts on

1306
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
this project.

1307
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
When we interview,

1308
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
we usually

1309
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
talk about the exact salary,

1310
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
such as how much

1311
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
the annual salary is.

1312
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
At least the annual salary is like this.

1313
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
If the company operates better,

1314
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I will add a few more months.

1315
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
This is a means that a company

1316
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
will definitely use

1317
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
when it is lazy.

1318
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But in Taiwan,

1319
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
for example,

1320
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
you may have a chance

1321
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
to apply for this scholarship

1322
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
when you come to Taiwan.

1323
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You may apply for it

1324
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
and you will get

1325
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
NT$40,000 scholarship

1326
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
every month for four years.

1327
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I started to talk to them.

1328
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Can't we give

1329
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
the school or push the school

1330
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
to have a more corporate thinking model?

1331
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Today,

1332
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Ralph is an excellent doctor.

1333
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
When he came in,

1334
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I already told him

1335
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
that we think

1336
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
he is an excellent doctor.

1337
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We hope that

1338
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
you will have a lot of economic support

1339
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
in this stage of your research.

1340
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
One of them is this project.

1341
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
If you choose to study at NTU,

1342
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I will give you this project.

1343
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Because we think your conditions are in line.

1344
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Even for those students

1345
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
who hesitate whether to study at NTU

1346
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
or NTU,

1347
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
can't these schools

1348
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
be more active in

1349
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
applying for scholarships?

1350
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Do we have to tell them

1351
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
that you may have a chance when you come in?

1352
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
In fact, the Ministry of Science and Technology

1353
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
heard this idea

1354
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
and they also want to move in this direction.

1355
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Although it seems that

1356
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
it is difficult to say at the university level.

1357
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
In fact, every university

1358
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
may be allocated

1359
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
some positions in each department,

1360
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
but they may not dare

1361
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
to be so brave

1362
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
to apply for scholarships.

1363
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
In fact, I think

1364
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
this is a very important direction

1365
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
to discuss.

1366
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So, in my own experience,

1367
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
it will be like this.

1368
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
That's all.

1369
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
OK.

1370
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I am Xiaoyu.

1371
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
What Justin just mentioned

1372
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
is that

1373
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
if NTU teachers

1374
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
are very active

1375
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
in applying for scholarships,

1376
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
NTU teachers

1377
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
can find the best students.

1378
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
But I also know that

1379
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
this is not

1380
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
what NTU professors

1381
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
should do

1382
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
through their personal strength.

1383
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
There should be

1384
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
a more comprehensive

1385
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
at least at the school level.

1386
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
For example, NTU itself

1387
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
should have more specific plans

1388
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
to assist teachers.

1389
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Instead of giving money to the school

1390
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
and saying,

1391
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
OK, you can do it yourself.

1392
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You have to provide

1393
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
all kinds of assistance to do it yourself.

1394
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
My point of view

1395
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
on doctoral education

1396
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
is that

1397
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
from our educational point of view,

1398
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
our scholarship

1399
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
is not a bonus, but a benefit.

1400
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
In fact, in doctoral education,

1401
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
to be honest,

1402
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
from the point of view of

1403
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
the government,

1404
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
we actually only look at one thing,

1405
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
that is, we only give it to excellent people.

1406
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But in fact, doctoral education

1407
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
is not only like this,

1408
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
there is also a free market.

1409
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
If someone is willing to come to

1410
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
the doctoral class and graduate,

1411
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
we will also open it to you.

1412
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But the related packages

1413
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
may not provide

1414
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you to pay for yourself,

1415
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
you may have to work harder

1416
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
or cooperate with the professor, etc.

1417
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
In addition,

1418
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
this is my general idea.

1419
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Let's open it to the audience

1420
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
to see if there are

1421
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
any other questions.

1422
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Thank you.

1423
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I have a question.

1424
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Are there any three people

1425
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
or sorry,

1426
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
two people besides Xiaoyu

1427
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
who want to add to what Xiaoyu just said

1428
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
or what else do you think?

1429
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
At the moment,

1430
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
everyone is very enthusiastic,

1431
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
so we have a lot of questions.

1432
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Or do you want to

1433
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
discuss the audience's questions?

1434
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Of course.

1435
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Sorry,

1436
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
because there are a lot of questions,

1437
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
we probably can't see all of them,

1438
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and there are really a lot of words,

1439
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
so I may miss it,

1440
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
so I apologize to everyone first.

1441
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Let's start from the beginning,

1442
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
because maybe some people

1443
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
want to add to what Xiaoyu just said.

1444
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Xun Yu asked,

1445
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
sorry, let me go back a little bit.

1446
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The sustainability of policies

1447
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
is terrible.

1448
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Recently, I heard a rumor that

1449
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
the Columbus Peace Project

1450
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
is about to die.

1451
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
No, I mean it's about to end.

1452
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I don't know if the government

1453
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
is specifically referring to

1454
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
the Love Song Project,

1455
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but the sustainability.

1456
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I don't know what you think.

1457
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Besides how to look at it,

1458
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
what should we do?

1459
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
OK.

1460
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Are we answering directly?

1461
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yes, yes.

1462
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
OK, let me talk about it.

1463
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I've been studying this topic recently.

1464
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
In fact, this goes back to

1465
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
the question I asked at the beginning.

1466
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
In fact, let me talk about

1467
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
the so-called Columbus or Einstein Project,

1468
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
which are all called

1469
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
the Young Learners Development Project

1470
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

1471
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That is, the preliminary basic construction budget

1472
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
may be a four-year

1473
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
continuous plan like this.

1474
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Because we are now

1475
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
moving towards the third phase,

1476
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
every four years,

1477
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
we are now slowly moving

1478
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
towards the third phase and starting to implement it.

1479
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
In fact, to answer a comprehensive

1480
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
question,

1481
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the current situation is

1482
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
that the budget should be reduced a little.

1483
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
If I remember correctly,

1484
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
is it 2.3 billion?

1485
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I need to look it up again,

1486
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
because I have such preliminary information in my hand.

1487
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
The preliminary report of the last issue

1488
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
is about the budget of the Young Learners Development Project

1489
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and the preliminary plan

1490
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
that is going to be reviewed

1491
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
in this issue.

1492
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It seems that the budget is a little less,

1493
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
but it is not terminated.

1494
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Back to the question I'm concerned about,

1495
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
why is this thing

1496
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
very interesting?

1497
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Because every year when I review the budget,

1498
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
we, as a supervision unit,

1499
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
will write a summary of the budget

1500
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
or freeze it,

1501
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
or the main resolution.

1502
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
These are all the parts that need to be

1503
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
formally replied to you,

1504
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and they are usually very worried about

1505
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
the budget of the legislators.

1506
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So usually

1507
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
they will be very concerned about

1508
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
all the things we write.

1509
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I write one thing every year.

1510
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I said that the Ministry of Education has a budget plan,

1511
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
the Ministry of Science and Technology has a

1512
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Young Learners Development Project,

1513
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and the Chinese Academy of Sciences,

1514
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
a research unit,

1515
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
they also have their own budget plans.

1516
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And sometimes

1517
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
in the budget of those international talents,

1518
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
the target that everyone is looking for

1519
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
is not too far away.

1520
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So let's go back to the beginning.

1521
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Is there any way

1522
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
to have a better integration?

1523
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
In fact, the Ministry of Science and Technology said

1524
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
that I was looking for

1525
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
research experts.

1526
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The Ministry of Education said

1527
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that the researchers

1528
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
actually operate

1529
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
like this.

1530
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
That is really a very vague situation.

1531
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So in fact, I think

1532
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
the plan is not to be broken,

1533
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
but we will pay more attention to

1534
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the different parts of the plan.

1535
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
In fact, 1 plus 1 must be greater than 2.

1536
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And in fact, the attitude of the Ministry of Science and Technology

1537
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
every year is that their budget is really not much.

1538
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We support all their plans.

1539
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Because I am

1540
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
in charge of the Ministry of Science and Technology

1541
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and I am in charge of the

1542
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
consultation policy or bill

1543
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
or budget supervision.

1544
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So I can really

1545
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
say that I fully support

1546
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
many of the plans of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

1547
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
The Ministry of Education really does less.

1548
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
But in some of the plans,

1549
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I actually think they must cooperate.

1550
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So every year we will continue to

1551
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
push this department.

1552
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
That's about it.

1553
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
OK.

1554
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I am Xiaoyu.

1555
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
My question is whether the

1556
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology

1557
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
will continue.

1558
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
As far as I know,

1559
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
just like what

1560
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Dr. Zha mentioned,

1561
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
the plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology

1562
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
and Einstein is really

1563
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
a special budget.

1564
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So in other words, it is the

1565
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
budget of the front-end plan.

1566
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
In fact, he said that

1567
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
there is a reduction of

1568
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
more than 2.3 billion.

1569
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So I think that

1570
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
after the new 520 minister

1571
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
took office,

1572
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
in fact, the plan of

1573
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
the Ministry of Science and Technology

1574
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
or the talent cultivation plan itself,

1575
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
in fact, they will already have a

1576
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
relatively long-term

1577
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
view of this matter.

1578
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
In other words,

1579
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
we are not pushing a short-term

1580
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
plan like the five-year plan,

1581
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
but in the future,

1582
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I believe it will be announced soon

1583
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
that this matter needs to be

1584
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
promoted for a long time.

1585
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
In other words, our country

1586
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
will have different plans for

1587
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
the cultivation of young scholars,

1588
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
whether they are young scholars,

1589
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
middle-aged scholars,

1590
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
or senior scholars.

1591
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
OK.

1592
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Ralph, do you want to add something?

1593
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Or are we looking for another question?

1594
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It doesn't matter.

1595
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I just saw an interesting question.

1596
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I think we should

1597
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
give this question to Ralph.

1598
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
This may be the most

1599
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
in line with your experience.

1600
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Sorry.

1601
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
He said,

1602
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
what is the relationship

1603
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
between the Association of Researchers

1604
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and the school?

1605
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Can you explain the financial

1606
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
situation of the school

1607
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
and the allocation of funds?

1608
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Then,

1609
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Jeff,

1610
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
the Association of Researchers

1611
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
in the U.S. can check the

1612
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
financial situation of the school

1613
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
and ask them to provide

1614
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
specific welfare conditions

1615
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
for the students,

1616
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
labor conditions,

1617
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and living conditions.

1618
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
What is the situation

1619
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
in Taiwan now?

1620
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I just answered

1621
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
the question.

1622
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The Association of Researchers

1623
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
mainly plans the use of

1624
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
the annual budget

1625
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
in the Association of

1626
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Researchers.

1627
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Unless there are special cases

1628
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
that need to be approved

1629
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
by the school council,

1630
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
most of the discussions and

1631
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
decisions will be made there.

1632
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
At present,

1633
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
there is no student representative

1634
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
in the Association of Researchers.

1635
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
In addition to the Association of

1636
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Researchers,

1637
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
there is another important

1638
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
participation channel called

1639
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
administrative meetings.

1640
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Administrative meetings

1641
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
are held by the principal,

1642
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
dean,

1643
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
and director

1644
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
to discuss

1645
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
how to plan

1646
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
the administration

1647
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
of the school.

1648
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
At that time,

1649
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
there will be at least

1650
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
one student representative

1651
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
in the meeting.

1652
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
The current situation is that

1653
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
when the school council

1654
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
feels that this matter

1655
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
is related to the students,

1656
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
they will issue a meeting notice

1657
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
saying that you can come to practice.

1658
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
By practice,

1659
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
it means that you do not

1660
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
have the right to vote,

1661
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
but the school will listen to

1662
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
your opinion.

1663
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
However,

1664
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
this is usually the last straw.

1665
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
When the school feels that

1666
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
this matter is not

1667
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
controversial,

1668
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
they will come to discuss with you.

1669
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
However, as you know,

1670
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
last year and the year before last,

1671
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
there was a lot of discussion

1672
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
about the principal,

1673
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
so some teachers

1674
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
who support the principal

1675
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
or conservative teachers

1676
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
will feel that

1677
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
some student representatives

1678
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
have this tendency,

1679
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
so they failed.

1680
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I am not depressed about the failure.

1681
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So,

1682
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I can listen to

1683
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
everyone's opinion

1684
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
more.

1685
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Especially today's discussion

1686
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
is very valuable.

1687
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Someone said that

1688
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
it may be related to

1689
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
the financial structure

1690
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
or the position of the school

1691
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
in general.

1692
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Ray has mentioned

1693
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
a very interesting thing.

1694
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I don't know what the other two

1695
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
think.

1696
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
He mentioned that

1697
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
this is related to

1698
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
the role we give them

1699
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
or their own role.

1700
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
What do you think

1701
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
about this?

1702
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
For example,

1703
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Xiaoyu or Zashi.

1704
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Are you talking about the role of the university?

1705
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yes.

1706
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
How does the university

1707
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
set its own role?

1708
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Will they decide how to do it?

1709
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You mean

1710
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
if the school

1711
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
thinks it is

1712
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
a research university

1713
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
or a teaching university

1714
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
or other types of universities,

1715
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
such as industrial universities

1716
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
or entrepreneurial universities?

1717
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Or something else?

1718
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Let me add something.

1719
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I think the financial structure

1720
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and the right of students

1721
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
are not necessarily related.

1722
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What is the reason?

1723
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
For example,

1724
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
private colleges in Taiwan

1725
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
have a tuition fee of

1726
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
50% to 70%.

1727
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But private colleges

1728
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
don't pay much attention to students.

1729
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
That's it.

1730
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
On the one hand,

1731
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
the atmosphere of students' self-participation

1732
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
is not so good.

1733
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
On the other hand,

1734
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
they don't pay much attention

1735
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
to students.

1736
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So it may be a sufficient condition,

1737
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
but not a necessary condition.

1738
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
If you have time,

1739
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I see Jeff

1740
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
wants to ask a question.

1741
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I think it's a good time.

1742
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So,

1743
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
if it's convenient for Jeff,

1744
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
please turn on the microphone

1745
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
to talk about REEF.

1746
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Thank you.

1747
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I'm a third-year student

1748
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
at the University of Indiana

1749
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
in the United States.

1750
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I used to work

1751
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
as a teacher

1752
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
for several years.

1753
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I think

1754
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
REEF's

1755
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
information about Taiwan is very good.

1756
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I think

1757
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
since Taiwan is different

1758
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
from the United States,

1759
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
the United States is a market mechanism.

1760
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Taiwan is mainly

1761
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
caught by the Ministry of Education.

1762
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
In this case,

1763
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
from the perspective

1764
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
of the Legislative Yuan,

1765
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I think REEF

1766
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
is an important role

1767
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
in the school

1768
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
role management process.

1769
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
In terms of supervision,

1770
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
can the school

1771
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
implement this mechanism?

1772
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
In addition,

1773
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
in addition to the REEF,

1774
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
REEF will also form a union.

1775
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
The union

1776
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
is different from the

1777
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
REEF.

1778
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The union actually

1779
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
starts from the perspective

1780
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
of the Legislative Yuan

1781
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
to talk about the lack of

1782
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
wage and salary.

1783
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What the school

1784
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
will do

1785
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
is to mobilize

1786
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
demonstrations

1787
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
and make demands.

1788
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
As I mentioned

1789
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
in the chat,

1790
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
these demands

1791
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
come from

1792
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
more information.

1793
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
For example,

1794
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
the salary of the school

1795
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
is transparent.

1796
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I can share with you

1797
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that REEF

1798
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
did some reports

1799
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and mentioned

1800
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
the salary of the

1801
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
football team

1802
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
coach

1803
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
is as high as

1804
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
6 to 7 million Taiwan dollars

1805
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
a year.

1806
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
They feel that

1807
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
the school

1808
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
cannot hide

1809
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
this information.

1810
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Therefore, the school

1811
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
cannot stand still.

1812
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I think the transparency of this information

1813
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
is very important.

1814
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Taiwan is not a market mechanism.

1815
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
The Ministry of Education

1816
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
should implement

1817
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
this transparent mechanism

1818
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
through the Ministry of Education.

1819
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Perhaps this will

1820
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
be helpful

1821
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
to solve the problem.

1822
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
That's all. Thank you.

1823
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I think this is

1824
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
a process of transformation.

1825
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
In the process of transformation,

1826
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I think it is very important

1827
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
to ensure the legalization.

1828
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Of course,

1829
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
in the next session,

1830
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
we will focus on

1831
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
the so-called school dismissal.

1832
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
However,

1833
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
many rights and interests

1834
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
are included in the Ministry of Education

1835
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
in the University Act

1836
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
or the school fund management

1837
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
in the Ministry of Education.

1838
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
These things should be reviewed.

1839
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Recently,

1840
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
many groups of students

1841
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
have come to

1842
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
communicate with us

1843
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
on the University Act.

1844
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
In terms of

1845
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
these self-government groups,

1846
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
can they have more

1847
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
guaranteed things?

1848
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
For example,

1849
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
we heard that

1850
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
some schools

1851
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
charge two different

1852
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
channels for their

1853
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
school fees.

1854
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You can't pay online.

1855
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You have to pay by paper.

1856
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This is incredible.

1857
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Or some schools

1858
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
because the students

1859
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
group, for example,

1860
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
the source of the money

1861
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
is the tuition fee.

1862
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Basically,

1863
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
the student council

1864
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
can decide

1865
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
what to do

1866
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and how to do it.

1867
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Even if the money

1868
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
is the tuition fee,

1869
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
the school has to do it.

1870
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
In fact, the student rights

1871
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
are moving forward.

1872
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
However,

1873
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
many schools still

1874
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
have a conservative attitude.

1875
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
What should we do?

1876
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I agree with what Jeff said.

1877
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
The student rights

1878
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
can't be a hostage.

1879
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
If you are willing to communicate

1880
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
with a good principal,

1881
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
you will have more opportunities.

1882
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Sometimes it's hard to be a principal.

1883
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
In the school council,

1884
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
he didn't just say it.

1885
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Many teachers are there.

1886
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
He wants to give students

1887
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
more space,

1888
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
but sometimes it's hard to do it.

1889
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Legislative establishment

1890
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
is necessary.

1891
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Through the university law

1892
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and the school fund,

1893
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
it's two different things.

1894
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
However,

1895
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
the legislative process

1896
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
is still ongoing.

1897
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Hello, I'm Xiaoyu.

1898
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Is Jeff studying

1899
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
at Indiana Bloomington?

1900
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I also graduated

1901
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
from this school.

1902
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I majored in higher education.

1903
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
As far as I know,

1904
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
the tuition fee

1905
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
for public universities

1906
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
is transparent.

1907
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It's in the US.

1908
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
In my impression,

1909
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
the IU Foundation

1910
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
is not open

1911
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
to the public.

1912
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I don't know

1913
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
if there are any adjustments.

1914
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Some employees

1915
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
are transparent.

1916
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
In my impression,

1917
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
the professors are not transparent.

1918
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
In Taiwan,

1919
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
the HR department

1920
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
often discusses

1921
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
whether the tuition fee

1922
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
is suitable for the public.

1923
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
In other words,

1924
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
will it cause

1925
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
some kind of

1926
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
malicious competition?

1927
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I think we should

1928
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
be careful

1929
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
and consider

1930
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
whether the tuition fee

1931
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
is suitable for the public.

1932
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
In the future,

1933
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
will there be

1934
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
a union

1935
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
or some rights protection?

1936
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I think we can

1937
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
work on it.

1938
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Through the union,

1939
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
the tuition fee

1940
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
can be improved.

1941
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I think it's

1942
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
a positive step.

1943
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That's all.

1944
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I don't understand

1945
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
one thing.

1946
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It's my personal question.

1947
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Why Taiwan

1948
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
or other countries

1949
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
like Japan

1950
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
have such

1951
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
poor

1952
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
marketing

1953
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
system?

1954
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
What's the reason?

1955
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Why do we

1956
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
become different

1957
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
from the US?

1958
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
In the US,

1959
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
for the sake of talents

1960
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
and PhD students,

1961
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
they hire people

1962
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
with their salary.

1963
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
But in Taiwan,

1964
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
the power of the labor market

1965
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
is the opposite.

1966
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
In other words,

1967
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
we need to ask

1968
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
the school to pay us tuition.

1969
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
If we don't pay

1970
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
the tuition fee,

1971
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
no one will

1972
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
pay the tuition fee.

1973
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
That's my question.

1974
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Why is Taiwan

1975
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
such a poor market?

1976
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
What's the reason?

1977
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Does anyone

1978
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
want to

1979
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
answer this question?

1980
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It looks like

1981
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Yu wants to answer.

1982
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Let me answer

1983
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
briefly.

1984
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
When we had a meeting

1985
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
last year,

1986
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yu asked

1987
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
this question.

1988
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Why is Taiwan

1989
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
not legalized?

1990
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
What's the current situation?

1991
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Yu's answer

1992
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
was

1993
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
there are

1994
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
several doubts.

1995
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
First,

1996
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
all the departments that don't make money

1997
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
may be shut down.

1998
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Because universities

1999
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
are the only indicators.

2000
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Second,

2001
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
the whole society

2002
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
is divided.

2003
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
What is our

2004
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
view of education?

2005
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I may need to look up

2006
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
the meeting notes.

2007
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
There may be other answers.

2008
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
However,

2009
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
people generally

2010
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
look at it

2011
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
as a negative effect

2012
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
on the society.

2013
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
What's the difference

2014
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
between legalization

2015
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
and marketization?

2016
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
That's all.

2017
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I'm Yu.

2018
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I have a question

2019
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
about whether

2020
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
higher education

2021
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
is a capital market.

2022
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Is it necessarily good?

2023
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It involves many things,

2024
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
such as regulation

2025
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
and so on.

2026
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
In my opinion,

2027
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
universities should not

2028
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
rely on the Ministry of Education.

2029
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Almost all universities

2030
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
rely on the Ministry of Education.

2031
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
However,

2032
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
the Ministry of Education

2033
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
spends

2034
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
less than half

2035
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
of their budget.

2036
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
As for

2037
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
legalization,

2038
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
such as Japan

2039
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
or other countries,

2040
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
it may lead to

2041
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
the collapse of

2042
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
non-profit science.

2043
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
To be honest,

2044
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
non-profit science

2045
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
is still

2046
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
maintained in the United States.

2047
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
For example,

2048
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
it is still maintained

2049
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
in the top universities

2050
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
in the field of

2051
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
human and social science.

2052
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
In my country,

2053
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
the National University

2054
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
is a national university.

2055
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It is responsible

2056
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
for maintaining

2057
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
non-profit science

2058
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
in the field of

2059
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
human and social science.

2060
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I think

2061
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
there should be

2062
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
more communication

2063
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
between universities.

2064
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It is not just

2065
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
trying to

2066
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
promote non-profit science.

2067
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
We should listen to

2068
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
everyone's opinions.

2069
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's all.

2070
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
What about Zha Shi?

2071
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Do you have any opinion?

2072
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It's okay.

2073
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Ralph has already said that.

2074
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Okay.

2075
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It has been more than

2076
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
an hour.

2077
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It will be an hour and a half

2078
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
in 10 minutes.

2079
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
That's what we didn't mention.

2080
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
If you are curious or

2081
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
want to know more,

2082
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
you can ask our speaker.

2083
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Or did I miss something?

2084
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Okay.

2085
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Sorry.

2086
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Go ahead.

2087
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I just want to share

2088
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
our high-profile

2089
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
video and meeting

2090
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
with you.

2091
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Okay.

2092
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Sorry.

2093
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I have a question.

2094
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Do you know

2095
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
how many high-profile researchers

2096
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
are needed in Taiwan?

2097
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Are there too many

2098
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
high-profile researchers?

2099
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Can we

2100
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
focus on some of them?

2101
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It's a classic question.

2102
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Can we ask

2103
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
this way?

2104
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
How many high-profile researchers

2105
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
are needed?

2106
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
How many schools?

2107
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
How many teachers?

2108
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
How many students?

2109
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It's a classic question.

2110
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
How many schools?

2111
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
How many teachers?

2112
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
How many students?

2113
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Do you have any opinion?

2114
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Do I have to say?

2115
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It's the biggest

2116
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
problem we have.

2117
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Obviously,

2118
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
there must be a big employment problem.

2119
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Let me give you an example.

2120
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
When we had a meeting,

2121
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
there was a simple calculation.

2122
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
There are so many

2123
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
high-profile researchers you can hire

2124
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
in a year.

2125
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
There is no shortage of

2126
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
people in the industry.

2127
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Every year,

2128
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
there are at least

2129
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
10 jobs

2130
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
in the industry.

2131
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
There is a big gap.

2132
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
So, we asked the Ministry of Education

2133
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
about the plan

2134
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
of the whole

2135
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
graduate school

2136
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
or the whole

2137
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
human resources evaluation.

2138
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
To be honest,

2139
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
the result we asked

2140
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
was that

2141
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
they didn't do well

2142
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
in the special graduate school.

2143
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
For example,

2144
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I said that

2145
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
the Ministry of Education

2146
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
did not investigate

2147
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
the high-profile talents

2148
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
for the development of 5 plus 2.

2149
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So,

2150
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
if you want to say

2151
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
if it's too deep now,

2152
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
it must be too deep.

2153
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
But what is a reasonable number?

2154
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Especially now,

2155
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
it's a decimal trend.

2156
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
When the industry transforms,

2157
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
is there any organization

2158
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
or a policy-making unit

2159
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
that can provide

2160
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
the answer?

2161
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
In my experience,

2162
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I don't think

2163
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
there is one.

2164
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Hello,

2165
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I'm Xiaoyu.

2166
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I think

2167
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
to find the problem

2168
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
or to find

2169
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
the future trend,

2170
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think

2171
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
we can do it.

2172
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
But what I'm confused about

2173
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
is that we can't find the solution.

2174
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
That's what I'm confused about.

2175
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Of course,

2176
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I think the industry needs

2177
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
our supply and demand

2178
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
must be

2179
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
accurate.

2180
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
That's what I'm confused about.

2181
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
But now,

2182
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
whether it's a PhD

2183
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
or a future talent

2184
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
evaluation,

2185
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I think

2186
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
it's very difficult.

2187
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
The industry

2188
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
may not know

2189
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
the relevant information.

2190
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
But they may not know

2191
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
the future development

2192
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
of their company

2193
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
or how many people

2194
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
they need

2195
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
in the next few years.

2196
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Even if you ask TSMC,

2197
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
they may not know.

2198
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
That's what I'm confused about.

2199
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
How many students

2200
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
do we need?

2201
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I agree that

2202
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
with the number of students

2203
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
and enrollment,

2204
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
let's say

2205
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
4,000 to 5,000 people a year,

2206
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
the demand in the academic world

2207
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
may be around 1,000 a year.

2208
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
There is a big gap

2209
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
between supply and demand.

2210
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
But the problem is

2211
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
that I think

2212
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
PhD education

2213
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
is half of

2214
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
what we need

2215
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
to find

2216
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
excellent academic talents.

2217
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I think half of it

2218
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
is the market mechanism.

2219
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Half of it is the economic planning,

2220
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
half of it is the market mechanism.

2221
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
In other words,

2222
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
if a lot of people

2223
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
are willing to take a PhD,

2224
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
it's OK for us.

2225
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But you may be burdened

2226
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
and take it as

2227
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
a part of the economic planning.

2228
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
For us,

2229
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
it's more important

2230
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
how to attract excellent people

2231
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
to take a PhD.

2232
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
This is what we may

2233
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
focus on in the future,

2234
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
whether it's research or industry.

2235
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
As for the school,

2236
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
as I mentioned at the end,

2237
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
how many universities

2238
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
or teachers

2239
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
or students

2240
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
or staff

2241
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
are there?

2242
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Some of you may know

2243
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
that if you calculate it,

2244
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
you will know that

2245
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
in the next 10 to 15 years,

2246
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I guess

2247
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
there are only

2248
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
national universities

2249
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
and medical universities

2250
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
with competitive

2251
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
medical departments

2252
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
in the future.

2253
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
To be honest,

2254
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
other schools will not be able to

2255
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
take a PhD or transfer.

2256
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
This is my personal opinion.

2257
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I guess

2258
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
that

2259
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
in the future,

2260
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
the number of teachers

2261
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
may be

2262
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
around 40,000

2263
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
or 50,000.

2264
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
At that time,

2265
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
there may be

2266
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
only about 20,000 teachers

2267
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
in the country.

2268
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
This is our current estimate.

2269
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
If you are interested,

2270
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
you can keep calculating

2271
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and see if it's what we think.

2272
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Our idea is

2273
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
to increase the number

2274
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
of students

2275
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
in national universities.

2276
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
This so-called increase

2277
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
is a situation

2278
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
where the total number

2279
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
is under control

2280
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
and the number

2281
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
of students

2282
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
is constantly increasing.

2283
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
The question is

2284
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
about schools, students and teachers.

2285
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
In fact,

2286
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
we say that this meeting

2287
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
must be held

2288
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,000


2289
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
school withdrawal regulations.

2290
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Otherwise,

2291
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
from the perspective

2292
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
of the Ministry of Education,

2293
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
the Ministry of Education

2294
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
has a budget

2295
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
of more than 26 million yuan every year.

2296
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
37% of the budget

2297
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
is spent on higher education,

2298
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
which is about 100 billion yuan.

2299
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
The current direction

2300
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
of the Ministry of Education

2301
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
is to cut

2302
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
some of the basic expenses

2303
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
and apply for

2304
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
a higher education upgrade plan

2305
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
for the school.

2306
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Of course,

2307
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
although private universities

2308
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
are not public,

2309
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
they still have some subsidies.

2310
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
So all schools

2311
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
say that the scholarship is not enough

2312
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
to apply for a higher education upgrade plan.

2313
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
In fact, this is just

2314
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
a basic default.

2315
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I can't make some breakthrough plans.

2316
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
These things are actually

2317
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
so many from the entire Ministry of Education.

2318
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But maybe we are going the wrong way in Taiwan.

2319
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
That is, from Guangzhou University

2320
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
to today,

2321
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
we have to close

2322
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
these universities one by one.

2323
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
In fact, we all know

2324
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
how difficult this is in practice.

2325
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Why didn't the school withdrawal regulations

2326
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
in Taiwan

2327
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
take too much power?

2328
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
If you want to close my private school,

2329
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
how many people

2330
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
will be affected?

2331
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
How much is the interest structure?

2332
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So everyone stepped on it and didn't do it.

2333
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
This is a very real

2334
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
situation.

2335
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Now we are focusing on the industry

2336
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
and pushing it to each school.

2337
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Now it's all like Xiaoyu said,

2338
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
extra fees.

2339
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
In fact, this is also a statistic.

2340
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Now the total enrollment

2341
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
of universities in Taiwan

2342
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
may be 250,000

2343
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
or 260,000.

2344
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
But the number of students we actually recruit

2345
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
seems to be only 160,000.

2346
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
What about the key industry now?

2347
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
It's extra fees.

2348
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
You will think,

2349
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
how can there be such a gap in numbers?

2350
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But now as long as it's a key industry,

2351
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
telecommunications, 5 plus 2,

2352
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
the national defense industry,

2353
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I'll give you an extra fee for your school.

2354
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
This is a strategy.

2355
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But why do this?

2356
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
In the end, it's still a cruel thing.

2357
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
You're going to cut the enrollment

2358
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
of schools today.

2359
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
What you touch is the teacher's

2360
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
current teaching.

2361
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
We can all understand

2362
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
what the actual problem may be.

2363
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
So when I think about

2364
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
this question,

2365
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
maybe I'm a minister.

2366
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I often

2367
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
communicate with many people

2368
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
about their own

2369
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
fundamentalism.

2370
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And many times it's really

2371
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
a huge thing.

2372
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It's really not that easy.

2373
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Maybe you have to start from a young age.

2374
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Do you think the Ministry of Education

2375
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
is actually calculating

2376
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
how many schools are left in the future?

2377
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I believe they won't do it.

2378
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
But now,

2379
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
just like the current version of the Ministry of Education

2380
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
that is to say,

2381
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I encourage you,

2382
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I give you a way,

2383
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
you can go.

2384
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
But the Ministry of Education's attitude is

2385
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
that in addition to this,

2386
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
it has no way to follow more actively.

2387
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It has already planned

2388
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
the number of schools that may be left in the future.

2389
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
The rest of these are

2390
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
going to be challenged in the future.

2391
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
It early deployed

2392
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
to tell these schools

2393
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
that you should retire first.

2394
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
In fact, this is really a very,

2395
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
very difficult thing.

2396
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Many people give their opinions.

2397
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
But from the perspective of the Ministry of Education,

2398
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
it has a lot of pressure

2399
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
from schools,

2400
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
even a lot of teachers.

2401
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I think this is a big problem.

2402
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
But indeed,

2403
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
from the total number of recruits

2404
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
to the actual number of recruits,

2405
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
in fact, just having such a big gap,

2406
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
we know that we definitely need

2407
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
more clues.

2408
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I think there are many more

2409
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
things to discuss.

2410
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
We seem to have a question.

2411
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I think this question

2412
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
is very suitable for an interlude.

2413
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
This question comes from

2414
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Liao Kunyan.

2415
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
His question is this.

2416
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
In Taiwan,

2417
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
among all kinds of problems,

2418
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
does the public really care about

2419
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
the education issue?

2420
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
This is a very cruel question.

2421
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
His answer is,

2422
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
do you have any specific ideas

2423
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
to help the public

2424
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
solve this problem?

2425
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Let's take this question

2426
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
to sum up today's event.

2427
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Let's go back to the order

2428
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
from the beginning.

2429
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Let's start with Xiaoyu.

2430
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I am Xiaoyu.

2431
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I am a high-level educator.

2432
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
But I often joke that

2433
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
high-level education

2434
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
is not professional.

2435
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
The so-called lack of professionalism

2436
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
is that we do not pay much attention

2437
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
to the public's opinion.

2438
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
As long as it is the public,

2439
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
as long as it is someone who

2440
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
used to go to college,

2441
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
or as long as it is a college teacher

2442
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
in the school,

2443
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
everyone thinks they know

2444
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
high-level education very well.

2445
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
But in fact,

2446
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
high-level education

2447
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
is a very complicated

2448
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and a situation

2449
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
that requires a lot of

2450
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
details to be discussed.

2451
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
In fact,

2452
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
high-level education

2453
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
is mainly based on

2454
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
research universities.

2455
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
In other words,

2456
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I can even say that

2457
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
it is mainly based on

2458
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
professors from the University of Taiwan.

2459
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
But in fact,

2460
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
professors from the University of Taiwan

2461
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
have a disadvantage

2462
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
that they cannot see

2463
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
the situation of other types

2464
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
of schools,

2465
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
but the problem is that

2466
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
we are really facing

2467
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
a problem.

2468
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
In fact, we cannot come up

2469
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
with a solution

2470
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
to solve the problem

2471
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
to help the high-level education

2472
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
industry or

2473
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
other schools

2474
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
to have a better development.

2475
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
In this case,

2476
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
it is difficult for me to say

2477
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
whether the public is

2478
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
concerned about high-level education

2479
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
or not.

2480
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
But in fact,

2481
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
we should also help

2482
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
other schools or institutions

2483
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
to propose specific solutions

2484
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
to the current situation

2485
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
of high-level education.

2486
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Thank you.

2487
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Thank you.

2488
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Let's move on to Justin.

2489
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
OK.

2490
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
In fact,

2491
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I think that

2492
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
high-level education

2493
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
today is more focused on

2494
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
post-doctoral or post-doctoral education.

2495
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
In fact, this is a stage

2496
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
of the pyramid.

2497
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Legislators want votes.

2498
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Which ethnic group has the most votes?

2499
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It is the state.

2500
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It is the state.

2501
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Because all people go through state education.

2502
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Most people go to college,

2503
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
but today we are concerned

2504
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
about the rights of doctoral students.

2505
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
When we talk about this matter,

2506
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
it is obvious that

2507
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
it is so small.

2508
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
But is it important?

2509
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Does it have anything to do

2510
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
with national security and national competitiveness?

2511
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Absolutely.

2512
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I think

2513
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
from this perspective,

2514
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
we probably know

2515
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
that legislators

2516
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
who are really concerned

2517
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
about this issue,

2518
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
and even peers of the Ministry of Education,

2519
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
when they are concerned about high-level education,

2520
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
they will spend more time

2521
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
and energy.

2522
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
After all,

2523
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
fewer and fewer students

2524
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
and fewer and fewer people

2525
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
are concerned about it.

2526
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
In fact,

2527
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I think

2528
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
it is important

2529
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
to start from

2530
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
what we are concerned about.

2531
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
We must have our own reasons

2532
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
and things we believe in,

2533
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
so we come out to pay attention.

2534
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
We call on more people

2535
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
who are concerned about this issue.

2536
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
In fact,

2537
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
when I first heard about

2538
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
what REEF was going to do in the future,

2539
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
it was very, very important.

2540
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
How can we get

2541
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
more people

2542
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
who are concerned about this issue

2543
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
to pay more attention

2544
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
and communicate more?

2545
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And through an organization,

2546
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
the actual energy

2547
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
you can generate is very strong.

2548
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I think it is very important

2549
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
to cooperate with these

2550
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
external units.

2551
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Because in the end,

2552
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
as REEF said at the beginning,

2553
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
from an official,

2554
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
even from the president

2555
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
of the Executive Yuan,

2556
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
whether he supports it

2557
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
or not,

2558
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
it is up to the leaders

2559
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
of these ministries

2560
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
and legislators

2561
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
to pay attention.

2562
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
There is no way to call

2563
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
a person who is already working

2564
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and not studying for a doctor

2565
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
to pay attention to this issue right away.

2566
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
But this is actually very distant.

2567
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
So I think it is very pragmatic

2568
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
to bring people who are willing to pay attention

2569
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
together through more activities

2570
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
as much as possible,

2571
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
so that we can do something together.

2572
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
That's all.

2573
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Okay, then it's REEF's turn.

2574
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
If you think about it

2575
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
in a pragmatic way,

2576
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
after we held the meeting

2577
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
of REEF,

2578
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
we thought that

2579
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
instead of doing more research

2580
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
and policy development

2581
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
for the Ministry of Education,

2582
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
we should think about

2583
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
how to continue

2584
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
a long-term power

2585
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
that can continue to happen

2586
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
with so many problems.

2587
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Assuming that

2588
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
there is no sudden

2589
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
interest in

2590
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
high-ranking or doctors,

2591
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
because of the issue of

2592
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
the ballot,

2593
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
and assuming that

2594
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
there is no sudden interest

2595
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
in government officials,

2596
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I think

2597
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
there are two possible

2598
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
possible options.

2599
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
There are three possible directions.

2600
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
One is that

2601
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
government officials have a certain chance

2602
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
to pay attention,

2603
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
and maybe they can

2604
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
have some formal

2605
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
legal institutions

2606
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
to do the research

2607
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
on the policy.

2608
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
The second is that

2609
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
universities should have

2610
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
more resources

2611
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
or be more serious

2612
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
in this area.

2613
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
There will be a more

2614
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
stable power in it.

2615
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
The third is what I'm thinking

2616
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
and what I want to do.

2617
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
When I asked the

2618
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
High-Level Education Association,

2619
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
they were

2620
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
proposing some

2621
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
reform proposals.

2622
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
However, the youth

2623
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
association under them

2624
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
has no manpower

2625
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
because everyone

2626
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
has to go to work after graduation.

2627
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Although the situation

2628
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
is difficult,

2629
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
there are some organizations

2630
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
and organizations

2631
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
around me

2632
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
who are willing

2633
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
to pay attention.

2634
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I hope to

2635
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
form some consensus

2636
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
to form an organization.

2637
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Instead of

2638
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
proposing a proposal

2639
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
or a policy study,

2640
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
it is more feasible

2641
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
to gather everyone's

2642
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
opinions and

2643
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
deepen

2644
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
or discuss

2645
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
and form an organization.

2646
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
That's it.

2647
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Thank you for watching!
