0	13000	Hello everyone, I am the host of today's presentation. My name is Lu Haoran. I am currently studying for my doctorate degree at the University of Connecticut in the United States.
13000	17000	I am also a staff member of Project Terra.
17000	37000	Project Terra provides online presentations to young Taiwanese scholars from all over the world.
38000	43000	Today's speaker is Mark Du Youlin.
43000	50000	I would like to start by reminding Mark that what we are about to see is not his video.
50000	54000	Therefore, I would like to ask him to share his screen.
54000	72000	Mark's past experience is in social science and education. His major is artificial intelligence, which includes personality, creativity, and consumer behavior.
73000	83000	After his research on cognitive science, his current research is related to natural language.
83000	89000	He is now a research assistant at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Connecticut.
89000	92000	He also has a personal website.
92000	99000	You are welcome to visit Project Terra's website for more information.
99000	105000	Today's topic is Applied NLP to Understand Creativity.
105000	109000	Take Twitter and Kickstarter for example.
109000	115000	It focuses on the knowledge of reverse engineering and applied psychology.
115000	119000	I believe everyone is very interested in today's presentation.
119000	123000	Thank you for attending today's presentation.
123000	135000	Before Mark's presentation, I would like to ask everyone to leave a comment in the chat area.
135000	138000	I will pass this question to Mark.
138000	139000	Please reply.
139000	142000	Now I will give the floor to Mark.
142000	144000	Hello, everyone.
144000	148000	Thank you for attending today's online presentation.
149000	153000	Today's topic is about public knowledge.
153000	156000	My name is Du Youlin.
156000	158000	My English name is Mark.
158000	160000	I will jump to my self-introduction page first.
160000	162000	My name is Mark.
162000	167000	At first, I studied social science at the University of Connecticut.
167000	176000	Then I transferred to the adult education department at the University of Connecticut.
176000	180000	Then I stayed at the University of Connecticut.
180000	185000	I was a research assistant at CS.
185000	191000	Now I am a research assistant at the Center for Neuroscience Research at the University of Connecticut.
191000	198000	When I was in college, there was a professor who specializes in human resources management.
198000	201000	He was interested in creativity.
201000	205000	So I learned from him.
205000	209000	When I graduated from college, I worked on an AI project.
209000	212000	So I am also quite interested in computer science.
212000	216000	I will combine these two topics today.
216000	224000	If you are interested in psychology, computer science, computer science, or data science,
224000	227000	you are welcome to communicate with me.
227000	229000	Data science has three parts.
229000	232000	If you have seen the literature diagram,
232000	234000	The top left corner is computer science.
234000	236000	The top right corner is data science.
236000	238000	The bottom is domain knowledge.
238000	240000	It depends on which major you are majoring in.
240000	244000	This field is really fascinating.
244000	248000	I will share it now.
248000	254000	There are four parts to my outline today.
254000	256000	The second part is self-introduction.
257000	261000	The second part is about public knowledge.
261000	266000	In general, people think that creativity is good.
266000	269000	In theory, the public knowledge website is very popular.
269000	273000	If you are very creative, I will share my research results.
273000	279000	The third part is about behavioral economics.
279000	281000	It's called reversal bias.
282000	284000	In a certain situation, we will choose A.
284000	286000	In a certain situation, we will choose B.
286000	290000	Why do we have such a reversal bias?
290000	292000	I will explain more later.
292000	294000	The last part is the conclusion.
294000	298000	Let's review today's topic.
298000	300000	Creative Fundraising.
300000	304000	How to write a creative fundraising?
304000	306000	How to raise the most money?
306000	311000	The tool I use is the latent language analysis in natural language processing.
311000	316000	I use KS as an example.
316000	320000	Let me briefly explain the definition of creativity.
320000	323000	There are two definitions of creativity.
323000	325000	The first one is the most familiar to us.
325000	327000	It's novelty.
327000	330000	It's the level of imagination.
330000	332000	The second one is more interesting.
332000	334000	The second one is useful.
334000	336000	It's not just imagination.
336000	340000	Your imagination can be used.
340000	342000	That's the so-called creativity.
342000	348000	There is a theory that creativity is economic theory.
348000	352000	If you can achieve great success in the economy,
352000	358000	we will think you are a useful ability.
358000	362000	That's all for today.
365000	367000	Sorry.
371000	374000	At the beginning of the first day,
374000	377000	I want to invite you to do a small activity.
377000	381000	This activity is a question.
381000	386000	The three pictures on the screen are the three products on Kickstarter.
386000	389000	The leftmost one is a ten-second toothbrush.
389000	391000	When you open your mouth,
391000	397000	the machine will clean your teeth in ten seconds.
397000	399000	This is the leftmost one.
399000	403000	The middle one is the 8K VR glasses.
403000	409000	The rightmost one is the first smart watch in the world.
409000	411000	These three are on Kickstarter.
411000	418000	I want you to guess which one is more creative.
418000	422000	In terms of natural language processing,
422000	425000	which one is more creative?
425000	429000	Which one gets the most money?
429000	432000	If you use consumer questionnaire,
432000	435000	which one is more likely to be chosen by consumers?
448000	457000	At this time, I want to cut it back.
465000	467000	Everyone guessed it.
467000	472000	One person said he thought it was VR.
472000	474000	The other three said it was a toothbrush.
474000	477000	Four people said it was a toothbrush.
477000	479000	More and more people chose the toothbrush.
479000	481000	More and more people chose the toothbrush.
484000	485000	This is quite interesting.
485000	488000	I also want to brush my teeth clean in ten seconds.
500000	503000	Let's wait another 20 seconds.
503000	504000	Okay.
506000	511000	I want to tell you that the screen has turned white again.
511000	515000	Let me check the comments.
519000	520000	Okay.
520000	525000	Let me take a look.
525000	529000	Two people said it was VR.
529000	532000	The other three said it was 567.
532000	536000	About seven people said it was a toothbrush.
536000	537000	Okay.
537000	540000	Let me switch back.
540000	541000	Okay.
541000	546000	Let me announce the answer.
546000	561000	Sorry, my mouse...
561000	563000	I can't see my mouse.
563000	565000	Oh, there it is.
565000	567000	Okay.
567000	568000	Announce the answer.
568000	572000	The mouse on the far left has the lowest amount of money.
573000	577000	The mouse on the far right has the highest amount of money.
577000	581000	However, if it is processed by a natural source and a questionnaire,
581000	583000	it will be the opposite.
583000	586000	As everyone voted,
586000	589000	everyone prefers a ten-second toothbrush.
589000	592000	If it is processed by a natural source,
592000	595000	the ten-second toothbrush is the most creative.
595000	596000	Okay.
596000	598000	You may think,
598000	599000	how can it be like this?
599000	602000	It looks like a great product.
602000	605000	How can it have such a low amount of money?
605000	609000	Next, I will introduce it.
611000	612000	Okay.
612000	618000	This product is recognized as one of the most creative products in history.
618000	620000	It is our iPhone.
620000	625000	Before Apple launched the iPhone,
625000	628000	it failed about 12 times.
628000	632000	Except for iPod, Macintosh, and Apple II.
632000	635000	It failed about 12 times.
635000	637000	Among these 12 times,
637000	640000	there are 9 products.
640000	641000	I listed them here.
641000	643000	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
643000	646000	These 9 products have something in common.
646000	648000	They all have something in common.
648000	650000	In fact, there is something in common
650000	654000	on the iPhone.
654000	656000	But the iPhone didn't fail.
656000	658000	And this feature
658000	661000	became the selling point of the iPhone.
661000	664000	It became the selling point of the iPhone.
664000	666000	Let's review it.
666000	668000	There are Newton, Lisa,
668000	672000	Apple TV, and palm-shaped computer.
672000	676000	There are many reasons for the failure of these products.
676000	678000	But they have one thing in common.
678000	680000	The iPhone has it, too.
680000	682000	It's too expensive.
684000	686000	Frankly speaking,
686000	688000	I personally think
688000	691000	the design of the iPhone is really amazing.
691000	693000	But in terms of business strategy,
693000	695000	especially in terms of pricing,
695000	699000	it is a completely wrong strategy.
699000	701000	Because it failed 9 times in a row.
701000	703000	This is definitely not a coincidence.
703000	706000	This is definitely the consumer's preference.
706000	708000	So we can see that
708000	710000	if a creative product
710000	712000	is priced too high,
712000	716000	the probability of failure is very high.
716000	718000	Even a genius like Dr. Jia
718000	720000	can't save this thing.
720000	722000	Next,
722000	727000	before I solve this problem,
727000	732000	let me introduce the natural resource processing tool I use.
732000	734000	This tool is called
734000	736000	latent semantic analysis.
736000	738000	It's a very interesting field in AI.
738000	743000	It's called latent semantic analysis.
743000	745000	This language analysis
745000	747000	assumes that
747000	749000	the similar text
749000	751000	between text and text
751000	754000	is less creative.
754000	756000	If these two words
756000	759000	are far apart on the language network,
759000	762000	if the probability of it appearing in the same article
762000	764000	is relatively low,
764000	767000	then we assume that it is more creative.
767000	769000	Because you think of something
769000	771000	that others may not think of.
771000	773000	People rarely connect
773000	775000	10 seconds with machines and tools.
775000	777000	So of course,
777000	779000	it is more creative.
779000	781000	Latent semantic analysis,
781000	784000	in addition to being used in this creative field,
784000	787000	it can help you sort your articles.
787000	789000	You can throw about five sentences.
789000	791000	After five sentences,
791000	793000	it may divide you into two concepts.
793000	795000	In these two concepts,
795000	797000	there will be a lot of words below.
797000	799000	You can see that
799000	801000	the meaning of the A group of words is closer.
801000	804000	The meaning of the B group of words is closer.
804000	806000	The result may be different from what you think.
806000	809000	So if you are interested in LSA,
809000	813000	you can search on the Internet
813000	815000	and try it.
815000	816000	This is LSA.
816000	819000	This picture is a bit out of place.
819000	821000	To put it simply,
821000	824000	this is a screenshot of a paper.
824000	827000	This paper was written by
827000	829000	a professor at UNC,
829000	831000	Kurt Gray.
831000	833000	He led a paper.
833000	836000	He measured creativity with words.
836000	839000	The green one below is Low Creativity.
839000	841000	He asked the audience
841000	843000	to write words
844000	846000	with their own ideas.
846000	848000	They kept writing and writing.
848000	850000	They tried to write something creative.
850000	852000	For example,
852000	854000	this group below
854000	856000	is called Grape, Strawberry, Fruit.
856000	858000	These are all fruits.
858000	860000	This is very close.
860000	861000	In terms of definition,
861000	863000	we can say that it is less creative.
863000	864000	For the above,
864000	868000	Grease, Slick, Sick, Nelsia, Ocean, Glass,
868000	870000	it seems that
870000	872000	they appear in the same article.
872000	874000	We define that
874000	876000	this person
876000	878000	is more creative
878000	880000	and more imaginative.
882000	884000	After introducing
884000	886000	the method of measuring creativity,
886000	889000	let's go back to the previous question.
889000	891000	Why do we like creativity
891000	893000	when we do
893000	895000	paper research,
895000	898000	but we don't like it when we actually buy it?
898000	900000	As you just saw,
900000	902000	if you do paper research,
902000	904000	when you actually
904000	906000	talk about it,
906000	908000	you will choose
908000	910000	creative products.
910000	912000	Computers can also measure this.
912000	914000	But if you put it
914000	916000	on the website
916000	918000	or sell it
918000	920000	directly on the market,
920000	922000	sometimes
922000	924000	these very novel products
924000	927000	are not sold well.
927000	929000	Why is this?
929000	931000	Because
931000	933000	we are actually
933000	935000	very
935000	937000	risk-averse.
937000	939000	When a product is
939000	941000	different from others,
941000	943000	consumers
943000	945000	like your creativity.
945000	947000	But on the other hand,
947000	949000	you have to think that
949000	951000	your product is very creative,
951000	953000	but because it is new,
953000	955000	we have never seen you before.
955000	957000	We will have uncertainty.
957000	959000	Uncertainty will produce
959000	961000	another thing called risk.
961000	963000	Let's take
963000	965000	Kickstarter as an example.
965000	967000	Kickstarter is a fundraising website.
967000	969000	Before your fundraising amount
969000	971000	reaches the target,
971000	973000	it will not be sold.
973000	975000	Your money may be invested
975000	977000	and it may be reimbursed.
977000	979000	Because the investment failed,
979000	981000	it can't be sold.
981000	983000	At this time, consumers will measure
983000	985000	the risk.
985000	987000	If I buy your product,
987000	989000	aka invest in your product,
989000	991000	will it evaporate
991000	993000	or not be sold?
993000	995000	So when your product is
995000	997000	very novel,
997000	999000	on the other hand,
999000	1001000	people will be a little scared
1001000	1003000	and dare not buy it.
1003000	1005000	When I asked my friends before,
1005000	1007000	I got a similar result.
1007000	1009000	My friends also chose this way.
1009000	1011000	Their reason is that
1011000	1013000	they really want to buy it,
1013000	1015000	but it is too expensive.
1015000	1017000	This is what people think.
1017000	1019000	This is very strange.
1019000	1021000	So,
1021000	1023000	do we like
1023000	1025000	creative products
1025000	1027000	or hate creative products?
1027000	1029000	This is very strange.
1029000	1031000	It means that
1031000	1033000	our attitude has changed.
1033000	1035000	We like it and we hate it.
1035000	1037000	I want to cut this thing
1037000	1039000	from the level of
1039000	1041000	behavior economics.
1041000	1043000	In behavior economics,
1043000	1045000	there is a thing called
1045000	1047000	conversion preference.
1047000	1049000	These two economists
1049000	1051000	did research in 1973.
1051000	1053000	When we
1053000	1055000	choose a product,
1055000	1057000	if its price
1057000	1059000	is fluctuating,
1059000	1061000	we will put the
1061000	1063000	high and low rankings
1063000	1065000	of this price
1065000	1067000	to make a conversion.
1067000	1069000	A is better than B,
1069000	1071000	but after the price adjustment,
1071000	1073000	B is suddenly better than A.
1073000	1075000	This is very contradictory
1075000	1077000	to traditional economics.
1077000	1079000	No matter what,
1079000	1081000	A is good.
1081000	1083000	No matter how the price changes,
1083000	1085000	I will definitely choose it.
1085000	1087000	This is the development
1087000	1089000	of behavior economics.
1089000	1091000	This is a small experiment.
1091000	1093000	Which plan do you
1093000	1095000	prefer?
1095000	1097000	We are now
1097000	1099000	investing in a plan
1099000	1101000	to save African children.
1101000	1103000	We spend $1,000 to save
1103000	1105000	100 children's lives.
1105000	1107000	We feed them.
1107000	1109000	This is the first plan.
1109000	1111000	Or we use
1111000	1113000	$2,000
1113000	1115000	to save
1115000	1117000	300
1117000	1119000	African children's lives.
1119000	1121000	This is very
1121000	1123000	intuitive.
1123000	1125000	The proportion is not equal.
1125000	1127000	$2,000 can save
1127000	1129000	300 lives.
1129000	1131000	The return on investment is higher than the previous plan.
1131000	1133000	There is no doubt.
1133000	1135000	Moreover,
1135000	1137000	life is priceless.
1137000	1139000	You can't use money to measure life.
1139000	1141000	It is reasonable to
1141000	1143000	choose A.
1143000	1145000	However,
1145000	1147000	if
1147000	1149000	today
1149000	1151000	I cover
1151000	1153000	A plan
1153000	1155000	to save 100 lives,
1155000	1157000	B plan to save 300 lives,
1157000	1159000	A plan is $1,000,
1159000	1161000	but
1161000	1163000	I cover
1163000	1165000	B plan $2,000,
1165000	1167000	I ask you
1167000	1169000	if you save 300 lives,
1169000	1171000	how much money
1171000	1173000	do you think the government
1173000	1175000	should spend to
1175000	1177000	save these lives?
1177000	1179000	However,
1179000	1181000	usually
1181000	1183000	the beneficiary will answer
1183000	1185000	the price lower than $2,000.
1185000	1187000	For example,
1187000	1189000	$1,500, $1,400, $1,300
1189000	1191000	will not
1191000	1193000	jump to $3,000.
1193000	1195000	They will
1195000	1197000	use your $1,000
1197000	1199000	to save 100 lives.
1199000	1201000	This is
1201000	1203000	Daniel Kahneman
1203000	1205000	and Tversky's
1205000	1207000	anchoring bias.
1207000	1209000	When you are given a set amount of money,
1209000	1211000	you will make some mistakes later.
1211000	1213000	You will not
1213000	1215000	multiply
1215000	1217000	100 to 300,
1217000	1219000	1,000 to 3,000.
1219000	1221000	We will save a little
1221000	1223000	$1,500, $1,600 will not
1223000	1225000	jump to $2,000.
1225000	1227000	This is the anchoring bias
1227000	1229000	in behavioral psychology.
1237000	1239000	Let's go back to
1239000	1241000	the product
1241000	1243000	of creativity.
1243000	1245000	Psychologists
1245000	1247000	do a series
1247000	1249000	of experiments
1249000	1251000	on creativity
1251000	1253000	and risk.
1253000	1255000	There are two groups of beneficiaries.
1255000	1257000	The first group
1257000	1259000	is the control group.
1259000	1261000	It presents a product
1261000	1263000	that is not creative like the iPhone.
1263000	1265000	The beneficiary uses
1265000	1267000	an attitude test
1267000	1269000	to connect
1271000	1273000	the creative product
1273000	1275000	with positive words,
1275000	1277000	such as happiness and warmth.
1277000	1279000	The positive words are connected.
1279000	1281000	The negative words
1281000	1283000	such as disgust and ugliness
1283000	1285000	are separated.
1285000	1287000	The other group
1287000	1289000	does the same experiment.
1289000	1291000	The beneficiary gets a creative product
1291000	1293000	and assigns
1293000	1295000	positive words to the creative product.
1295000	1297000	The negative words are
1297000	1299000	far away from the product.
1299000	1301000	Creativity
1301000	1303000	is very social.
1303000	1305000	In theory,
1305000	1307000	if you don't talk about it,
1307000	1309000	everyone will think
1309000	1311000	that you like creative products.
1311000	1313000	The more, the better.
1313000	1315000	The more, the better.
1315000	1317000	Whether it's business or other aspects,
1317000	1319000	as long as this person is creative,
1319000	1321000	everyone thinks it's great.
1321000	1323000	The attitude test is implicit.
1323000	1325000	It doesn't affect
1325000	1327000	your social expectations.
1327000	1329000	If you have a different view
1329000	1331000	from the society,
1331000	1333000	it can be tested.
1333000	1335000	This is the so-called
1335000	1337000	inner attitude test.
1337000	1339000	Let's talk about
1339000	1341000	the experiment group.
1341000	1343000	What is the behavior
1343000	1345000	of the other group?
1345000	1347000	There is a balloon
1347000	1349000	next to the iPhone.
1349000	1351000	The experimenter
1351000	1353000	will accidentally
1353000	1355000	poke the balloon.
1355000	1357000	The balloon will explode.
1357000	1359000	When the balloon explodes,
1359000	1361000	the beneficiary will hear the sound.
1361000	1363000	The beneficiary will be surprised.
1363000	1365000	The sound is enough
1365000	1367000	to scare the beneficiary.
1367000	1369000	After the beneficiary is scared,
1369000	1371000	there is a little cash in the balloon.
1371000	1373000	It means
1373000	1375000	the money is yours.
1375000	1377000	In other words,
1377000	1379000	you don't know how the balloon will explode.
1379000	1381000	The sound will scare you.
1381000	1383000	You will feel disgusted.
1383000	1385000	After this uncertainty,
1385000	1387000	there will be some cash.
1387000	1389000	It simulates
1389000	1391000	the creative
1391000	1393000	and high-risk creativity.
1393000	1395000	They asked the beneficiary
1395000	1397000	to do an inner attitude test.
1397000	1399000	As a result,
1399000	1401000	the experimenter
1401000	1403000	found that
1403000	1405000	the group without balloons
1405000	1407000	have a good relationship
1407000	1409000	with the beneficiary.
1409000	1411000	But the group above
1411000	1413000	had a different experience.
1413000	1415000	The group above
1415000	1417000	has an inner attitude.
1417000	1419000	They are not
1419000	1421000	so close to the beneficiary.
1423000	1425000	Their relationship
1425000	1427000	with the beneficiary
1427000	1429000	will be easier.
1429000	1431000	The beneficiary will feel disliked
1431000	1433000	and sick.
1433000	1435000	Faced with
1435000	1437000	the high risk
1437000	1439000	of scaring people,
1439000	1441000	our attitude
1441000	1443000	towards entrepreneurship
1443000	1445000	will change.
1449000	1451000	So,
1451000	1453000	our attitude towards entrepreneurship will change.
1453000	1455000	How do we explain this?
1455000	1457000	This is
1457000	1459000	based on
1459000	1461000	the reversal bias of
1461000	1463000	the group above.
1463000	1465000	Let's say
1465000	1467000	you want to choose a handsome guy
1467000	1469000	to be your partner.
1469000	1471000	I will present
1471000	1473000	three options.
1473000	1475000	The first one is Tom Cruise.
1475000	1477000	The second one is Joe Kerman.
1477000	1479000	The third one is Elon Musk.
1479000	1481000	Tom Cruise is more handsome
1481000	1483000	than Joe Kerman.
1483000	1485000	Joe Kerman can sing
1485000	1487000	and he is also handsome.
1487000	1489000	He also acted in a movie.
1489000	1491000	Elon Musk is also
1491000	1493000	one of the candidates.
1493000	1495000	However,
1495000	1497000	if you compare Elon Musk
1497000	1499000	with Tom Cruise,
1499000	1501000	Tom Cruise is not
1501000	1503000	as handsome as Elon Musk.
1503000	1505000	Some people
1505000	1507000	may think
1507000	1509000	Elon Musk is
1509000	1511000	an entrepreneur
1511000	1513000	and he is smart.
1513000	1515000	He is smarter than Tom Cruise.
1515000	1517000	So,
1517000	1519000	people will choose Elon Musk
1519000	1521000	over Tom Cruise.
1521000	1523000	So,
1523000	1525000	A is greater than B,
1525000	1527000	B is greater than C,
1527000	1529000	but C is greater than A.
1529000	1531000	This is a magical inequality.
1531000	1533000	This is
1533000	1535000	the experiment
1535000	1537000	of Daniel Kahneman,
1537000	1539000	his partner,
1539000	1541000	who did
1541000	1543000	a classic
1543000	1545000	economic experiment.
1545000	1547000	You may think
1547000	1549000	how to calculate
1549000	1551000	the weight of power.
1551000	1553000	Is smart more important
1553000	1555000	or handsome?
1555000	1557000	Or is it as important
1557000	1559000	as Joe Kerman's dancing?
1559000	1561000	Which one is more important?
1561000	1563000	It is strange.
1563000	1565000	We have to use a mathematical formula
1565000	1567000	or it is illogical.
1569000	1571000	This is
1571000	1573000	what I learned
1573000	1575000	from YouTube.
1575000	1577000	It is
1577000	1579000	a course
1579000	1581000	by Amos Tversky
1581000	1583000	in 1981.
1583000	1585000	It is called
1585000	1587000	Measuring Inequality.
1587000	1589000	It was
1589000	1591000	uploaded to YouTube
1591000	1593000	in October 2019.
1593000	1595000	It is called
1595000	1597000	Measuring Inequality.
1597000	1599000	He wrote
1599000	1601000	this proof.
1601000	1603000	It is
1603000	1605000	9, 13, 19 points.
1605000	1607000	Let's interpret it
1607000	1609000	as a product's quality
1609000	1611000	or creativity.
1611000	1613000	9 points of creativity, 13 points of creativity, 19 points of creativity.
1613000	1615000	Of course,
1615000	1617000	19 points of creativity is higher than 9 points of creativity.
1617000	1619000	It is unquestionable.
1619000	1621000	What about the left?
1621000	1623000	The left is the price of the product.
1623000	1625000	No one
1625000	1627000	wants to buy things with 30 dollars.
1627000	1629000	Try to use 10 dollars.
1629000	1631000	So,
1631000	1633000	our preference is
1633000	1635000	from left to right,
1635000	1637000	from top to bottom.
1637000	1639000	Then,
1639000	1641000	we multiply
1641000	1643000	these six numbers
1643000	1645000	by 9.
1645000	1647000	We use
1647000	1649000	the product's
1649000	1651000	quality score
1651000	1653000	to multiply
1653000	1655000	the product's price.
1655000	1657000	Let's say
1657000	1659000	13 times 30 is
1659000	1661000	390.
1661000	1663000	Let's take 390
1663000	1665000	as a general attitude.
1665000	1667000	Overall,
1667000	1669000	how much does he like this product?
1669000	1671000	For
1671000	1673000	normal logic,
1673000	1675000	let's look at the orange arrow.
1675000	1677000	The orange arrow is normal logic.
1677000	1679000	It is
1679000	1681000	from top to bottom.
1681000	1683000	The lower right corner
1683000	1685000	is
1685000	1687000	the lower
1687000	1689000	the score.
1689000	1691000	We can use
1691000	1693000	lower cost
1693000	1695000	to buy this product.
1695000	1697000	This is normal logic.
1697000	1699000	However,
1699000	1701000	under certain conditions,
1701000	1703000	you can see the middle
1703000	1705000	line.
1705000	1707000	There is a god logic.
1707000	1709000	It will
1709000	1711000	show 270
1711000	1713000	to 260.
1713000	1715000	We call it
1715000	1717000	risk.
1717000	1719000	In this case,
1719000	1721000	we don't care about the risk.
1721000	1723000	We don't care.
1723000	1725000	270 is high risk.
1725000	1727000	If
1727000	1729000	there is a god logic,
1729000	1731000	how does it work?
1731000	1733000	On the left,
1733000	1735000	we multiply
1735000	1737000	by
1737000	1739000	10.
1739000	1741000	We multiply
1741000	1743000	by 10.
1743000	1745000	On the right,
1745000	1747000	the growth rate
1747000	1749000	is not that high.
1749000	1751000	On the left,
1751000	1753000	30 and 10
1753000	1755000	are 3 times higher.
1755000	1757000	9 and 19
1757000	1759000	are not 3 times higher.
1759000	1761000	Let's assume
1761000	1763000	we don't care about
1763000	1765000	creativity.
1765000	1767000	We don't multiply.
1767000	1769000	The price is double.
1769000	1771000	The number of creativity
1771000	1773000	is not
1773000	1775000	the growth rate.
1775000	1777000	In this case,
1777000	1779000	the matrix
1779000	1781000	will be
1781000	1783000	multiplied by
1783000	1785000	the god logic.
1785000	1787000	Under certain conditions,
1787000	1789000	we are afraid of
1789000	1791000	the risk.
1791000	1793000	Under certain conditions,
1793000	1795000	we don't care about the risk.
1795000	1797000	It is
1797000	1799000	hard to understand.
1799000	1801000	So,
1801000	1803000	I think it is better
1803000	1805000	to use crisis analysis.
1805000	1807000	In general,
1807000	1809000	we have the same
1809000	1811000	statistical chart.
1811000	1813000	We have the same
1813000	1815000	preference for a thing.
1815000	1817000	So,
1817000	1819000	we draw a straight line.
1819000	1821000	However,
1821000	1823000	our preference for creativity
1823000	1825000	is not a straight line
1825000	1827000	but a curve.
1827000	1829000	At first,
1829000	1831000	we like creativity.
1831000	1833000	However,
1833000	1835000	as the price goes up,
1835000	1837000	we only go from 9 to 19
1837000	1839000	instead of 27.
1839000	1841000	So,
1841000	1843000	our creativity
1843000	1845000	is not a straight line
1845000	1847000	but a curve
1847000	1849000	on the chart.
1849000	1851000	So,
1851000	1853000	it is close to the concept of crisis.
1853000	1855000	As you know,
1855000	1857000	behavioral economics
1857000	1859000	shows the preference
1859000	1861000	for a thing
1861000	1863000	in the way of crisis analysis.
1863000	1865000	Traditional economics
1865000	1867000	is a curve.
1867000	1869000	It is a straight line.
1869000	1871000	It is very intuitive.
1871000	1873000	However, human beings are irrational.
1873000	1875000	When the price
1875000	1877000	goes up to a certain level,
1877000	1879000	the preference
1879000	1881000	for a thing
1881000	1883000	becomes smaller and smaller.
1883000	1885000	This is the difference
1885000	1887000	between traditional economics
1887000	1889000	and behavioral economics.
1889000	1891000	In fact,
1891000	1893000	it lacks professional knowledge.
1893000	1895000	I asked a senior
1895000	1897000	how to explain
1897000	1899000	the curve
1899000	1901000	to a manager.
1901000	1903000	He said
1903000	1905000	it lacks domain expertise.
1905000	1907000	You need professional knowledge.
1907000	1909000	You can't explain it
1909000	1911000	to your manager
1911000	1913000	with your professional knowledge.
1913000	1915000	This is the concept of curve.
1915000	1917000	To sum up,
1917000	1919000	if your idea
1919000	1921000	is very novel,
1921000	1923000	you should
1923000	1925000	lower
1925000	1927000	your price.
1927000	1929000	Don't raise
1929000	1931000	your price.
1931000	1933000	People will be afraid.
1933000	1935000	They will think
1935000	1937000	your idea is good
1937000	1939000	but
1939000	1941000	on the other hand,
1941000	1943000	if your idea
1943000	1945000	is very low,
1945000	1947000	you should
1947000	1949000	use your imagination.
1949000	1951000	For example,
1951000	1953000	when a YouTuber
1953000	1955000	uploads a video,
1955000	1957000	the cost is low.
1957000	1959000	So,
1959000	1961000	if you want to be a successful YouTuber,
1961000	1963000	you need to
1963000	1965000	use your imagination
1965000	1967000	to make your video popular.
1967000	1969000	For example,
1969000	1971000	if your video
1971000	1973000	has 10 views,
1973000	1975000	but none of them likes you,
1975000	1977000	the 10th video
1977000	1979000	happens to
1979000	1981000	hit a certain person,
1981000	1983000	the person
1983000	1985000	likes your video
1985000	1987000	and your subscription
1987000	1989000	goes up.
1989000	1991000	This is the strategy.
1991000	1993000	If you don't join the membership,
1993000	1995000	I will click your video
1995000	1997000	to watch.
1997000	1999000	On the other hand,
1999000	2001000	if you are a high-cost YouTuber
2001000	2003000	who is conservative,
2003000	2005000	you want to satisfy
2005000	2007000	all your subscribers,
2007000	2009000	the success rate will be low.
2009000	2011000	In general,
2011000	2013000	people don't want to watch
2013000	2015000	funny and boring videos.
2017000	2019000	These are the references.
2019000	2021000	The first one
2021000	2023000	is a paper
2023000	2025000	about
2025000	2027000	measuring creativity.
2027000	2029000	The second one
2029000	2031000	is
2031000	2033000	a book
2033000	2035000	about creativity.
2035000	2037000	There is a Chinese version
2037000	2039000	of the balloon experiment.
2039000	2041000	You can check it out.
2041000	2043000	It's very interesting.
2043000	2045000	The third one
2045000	2047000	is Originals.
2047000	2049000	It's written by
2049000	2051000	Alan Grant.
2051000	2053000	The Chinese translation is
2053000	2055000	版判.
2055000	2057000	It's very interesting.
2057000	2059000	It describes
2059000	2061000	the risks
2061000	2063000	of creativity.
2063000	2065000	It describes
2065000	2067000	how creative people
2067000	2069000	are.
2069000	2071000	Alan Grant is
2071000	2073000	an excellent psychologist.
2073000	2075000	The next one is
2075000	2077000	Justin Byrne.
2077000	2079000	He specializes in
2079000	2081000	predicting creativity.
2081000	2083000	He predicts
2083000	2085000	whether creativity
2085000	2087000	will be successful in the future.
2087000	2089000	It's very difficult.
2089000	2091000	But he did it.
2091000	2093000	He is really strong.
2093000	2095000	The next one
2095000	2097000	is
2097000	2099000	a paper
2099000	2101000	on behavioral economics.
2101000	2103000	It was first published
2103000	2105000	in 1973.
2105000	2107000	It's called
2107000	2109000	Experimental Psychology.
2109000	2111000	The last one
2111000	2113000	is
2113000	2115000	Daniel Kahneman's
2115000	2117000	partner,
2117000	2119000	Amos Tversky and
2119000	2121000	Richard Seiler.
2121000	2123000	It's about
2123000	2125000	anomalous preference reversal.
2125000	2127000	It's about
2127000	2129000	why our preferences
2129000	2131000	are so amazing.
2131000	2133000	A is greater than B,
2133000	2135000	and B is greater than A.
2135000	2137000	It's amazing.
2137000	2139000	There are many
2139000	2141000	details in the paper.
2141000	2143000	If you're interested,
2143000	2145000	you can
2145000	2147000	look it up.
2147000	2149000	That's
2149000	2151000	all for
2151000	2153000	my presentation.
2153000	2155000	Any questions?
2155000	2157000	Any questions?
2161000	2163000	If you have questions,
2163000	2165000	you can ask them directly.
2165000	2167000	Yes.
2167000	2169000	I have a question.
2169000	2171000	You just
2171000	2173000	drew a picture.
2173000	2175000	You said creativity
2175000	2177000	is not limited
2177000	2179000	to people.
2179000	2181000	It's increasing
2181000	2183000	and becoming more and more attractive.
2183000	2185000	For example,
2185000	2187000	is there any experimental
2187000	2189000	approach
2189000	2191000	or someone trying to
2191000	2193000	analytically model it?
2193000	2195000	For example,
2195000	2197000	is there any way to
2197000	2199000	quantify
2199000	2201000	creativity
2201000	2203000	and make it a axis?
2203000	2205000	Another axis is
2205000	2207000	I can somehow quantify
2207000	2209000	attractiveness.
2209000	2211000	Then I can
2211000	2213000	quantify
2213000	2215000	the green line.
2217000	2219000	I think
2219000	2221000	this model is OK.
2221000	2223000	But I'm doing
2223000	2225000	document analysis and
2225000	2227000	data science analysis.
2227000	2229000	So I haven't done it
2229000	2231000	in the lab.
2231000	2233000	I'll figure it out
2233000	2235000	in the future.
2237000	2239000	OK. Thank you.
2241000	2243000	Any questions?
2247000	2249000	If you have
2249000	2251000	other questions,
2251000	2253000	you can unmute
2253000	2255000	yourself.
2255000	2257000	Then you can ask.
2263000	2265000	If you have questions,
2265000	2267000	you can unmute yourself.
2267000	2269000	Hello?
2269000	2271000	Can you hear me?
2271000	2273000	I'm Anping.
2273000	2275000	I have a question.
2275000	2277000	Your speech
2277000	2279000	was very interesting.
2283000	2285000	I didn't hear
2285000	2287000	what you said
2287000	2289000	about data science
2289000	2291000	in the beginning.
2291000	2293000	How does data science
2293000	2295000	contribute to creativity?
2295000	2297000	But I heard
2297000	2299000	data science
2299000	2301000	contributes to
2301000	2303000	future direction,
2303000	2305000	possibility,
2305000	2307000	traditional experiments,
2307000	2309000	behavioral economics,
2309000	2311000	and experimental psychology.
2311000	2313000	Can you tell us
2313000	2315000	more about
2315000	2317000	data science
2317000	2319000	playing a special role
2319000	2321000	or future role?
2321000	2323000	And you seem to have the result.
2323000	2325000	You said you have data to predict.
2325000	2327000	Is it something like that?
2327000	2329000	Thank you.
2329000	2331000	At that time,
2331000	2333000	I was purely
2333000	2335000	analyzing
2335000	2337000	the website
2337000	2339000	provided in the paper.
2339000	2341000	The result of the analysis
2341000	2343000	is the total amount
2343000	2345000	of data
2345000	2347000	on Kickstarter
2347000	2349000	and the paper.
2349000	2351000	It's called Forward Flow.
2351000	2353000	It's related to
2353000	2355000	negative.
2355000	2357000	So,
2357000	2359000	I think data science
2359000	2361000	and psychology
2361000	2363000	are interlinked.
2363000	2365000	You will see
2365000	2367000	something different
2367000	2369000	from your common sense
2369000	2371000	or domain knowledge.
2371000	2373000	At this time,
2373000	2375000	you have to think
2375000	2377000	whether
2377000	2379000	there is something wrong
2379000	2381000	with this program
2381000	2383000	and whether
2383000	2385000	common sense is biased
2385000	2387000	or domain knowledge needs to be modified.
2387000	2389000	You need to have
2389000	2391000	a little intuition
2391000	2393000	and professionalism.
2393000	2395000	If you find that
2395000	2397000	this is against
2397000	2399000	common sense,
2399000	2401000	but it has
2401000	2403000	the academic theory
2403000	2405000	of creativity to explain it.
2405000	2407000	However,
2407000	2409000	there is a theory to explain it,
2409000	2411000	but it's still
2411000	2413000	in the academic theory.
2413000	2415000	So,
2415000	2417000	this is a space for development.
2417000	2419000	You can
2419000	2421000	use
2421000	2423000	this kind of
2423000	2425000	computer program
2425000	2427000	to run some data.
2427000	2429000	You can copy and paste at the beginning.
2429000	2431000	If you find that
2431000	2433000	it's against common sense
2433000	2435000	and domain knowledge,
2435000	2437000	you can think about
2437000	2439000	whether this is
2439000	2441000	a good question
2441000	2443000	for future research.
2451000	2453000	Can I ask another question?
2453000	2455000	You mentioned
2455000	2457000	data science
2457000	2459000	and the difference
2459000	2461000	between it and domain knowledge.
2461000	2463000	I'm not sure
2463000	2465000	if you know
2465000	2467000	what data science is.
2467000	2469000	I don't even know what it is.
2469000	2471000	Can you explain
2471000	2473000	what kind of
2473000	2475000	way data science
2475000	2477000	looks at these issues?
2477000	2479000	I don't know what it is.
2479000	2481000	Thank you.
2481000	2483000	This question
2483000	2485000	is a bit difficult.
2485000	2487000	Let me use another PowerPoint
2487000	2489000	to explain.
2489000	2491000	This is another research I did.
2491000	2493000	I went to
2493000	2495000	Cambridge Analytica.
2495000	2497000	If you know
2497000	2499000	how to steal
2499000	2501000	data from Facebook,
2501000	2503000	you should know
2503000	2505000	what Cambridge Analytica does.
2505000	2507000	A group of data scientists
2507000	2509000	steal text from Facebook
2509000	2511000	to predict your personality traits.
2515000	2517000	Their research
2517000	2519000	is in conflict with
2519000	2521000	domain knowledge.
2525000	2527000	How do we
2527000	2529000	explain this phenomenon?
2529000	2531000	Data science
2531000	2533000	is the third
2533000	2535000	block,
2535000	2537000	and it's the most important.
2537000	2539000	LSA,
2539000	2541000	Latent Semantic Analysis,
2541000	2543000	doesn't use
2543000	2545000	Bayes' Theorem to calculate.
2545000	2547000	It calculates
2547000	2549000	the relationship between
2549000	2551000	words and words,
2551000	2553000	not cause and effect.
2553000	2555000	Cambridge Analytica
2555000	2557000	does use cause and effect.
2557000	2559000	Here,
2559000	2561000	they use LSA
2561000	2563000	plus probability.
2563000	2565000	D stands for text.
2565000	2567000	Z stands for topic.
2567000	2569000	W stands for word.
2569000	2571000	This word
2571000	2573000	has a chance
2573000	2575000	to appear
2575000	2577000	in this document.
2577000	2579000	This is
2579000	2581000	the probability.
2581000	2583000	If I appear
2583000	2585000	in this topic,
2585000	2587000	what is the probability
2587000	2589000	that I appear in this word?
2589000	2591000	If I appear in this document,
2591000	2593000	what is the probability
2593000	2595000	that I appear in this topic?
2595000	2597000	They use Bayes' Theorem
2597000	2599000	to calculate.
2599000	2601000	Here,
2601000	2603000	we can explain
2603000	2605000	these two things
2605000	2607000	in the same way,
2607000	2609000	but the difference
2609000	2611000	in the algorithm
2611000	2613000	causes the difference
2613000	2615000	in the data structure.
2615000	2617000	Let's use
2617000	2619000	LSA's Theorem.
2619000	2621000	Let's look at
2621000	2623000	a set of data.
2623000	2625000	We can see
2625000	2627000	this large piece of data
2627000	2629000	as Cambridge Analytica.
2629000	2631000	We can see
2631000	2633000	this large piece of data
2633000	2635000	as Cambridge Analytica.
2635000	2637000	If you divide it
2637000	2639000	into popular singers,
2639000	2641000	the popular singer
2641000	2643000	is related.
2643000	2645000	However,
2645000	2647000	the popular singer
2647000	2649000	is only a small piece
2649000	2651000	in all creative people.
2651000	2653000	If you add
2653000	2655000	a conditional probability,
2655000	2657000	you can cut
2657000	2659000	this small piece
2659000	2661000	of data.
2661000	2663000	I tried to
2663000	2665000	explain in math.
2665000	2667000	I tried to explain in math.
2667000	2669000	I tried to explain in math.
2669000	2671000	This is the mathematical proof
2671000	2673000	of the Tversky hypothesis.
2673000	2675000	This is the Mathematical proof of the Tversky hypothesis.
2675000	2677000	I used this mathematical proof
2677000	2679000	to explain
2679000	2681000	the question of
2681000	2683000	computer science
2683000	2685000	and
