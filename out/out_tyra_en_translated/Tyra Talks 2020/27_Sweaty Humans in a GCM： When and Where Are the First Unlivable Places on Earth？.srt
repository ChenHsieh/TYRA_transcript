00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome everyone to participate in the online speech of Tara today.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, we are very honored to invite Lu Yiquan, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, to help us do a talk on his research.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Tara is an online platform that focuses on Ph.D. students from Taiwan and abroad,

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and we hope that these Ph.D. students can do their own research on the Tara platform.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We also hope that this platform can attract talents in the same field to exchange and collaborate with each other.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is our end goal, and this is the main work that Tara is currently doing.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Today, Lu Yiquan will mainly talk about the topic of 3T-Humans in GCM,

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
when and where are the first livable places on Earth.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Lu Yiquan is a Ph.D. student at the University of Taiwan Physics Department,

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and later graduated as a Ph.D. student at the University of Taiwan Physics Department,

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and is now a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley,

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so he is very loyal to physics.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's not like me, I just jumped into a lot of different fields.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Looking at this GCM, Global Climate Change Model,

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am a bit familiar with this name, but I am a biologist.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
GCM in our biology is called Glial Missing Homology,

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which is another protein name.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So there are a lot of, you know, sometimes these abbreviations are so-called mixed up.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So when I saw this topic, I suddenly wondered if it was related to my biology.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, it has something to do with global climate change.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, we are honored to have Yiquan to do this talk for us today.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, the stage is yours.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, thank you, host.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, so what does this topic mean?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll tell you later.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The main question I want to answer in this speech is the following.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That is, in the future world,

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which place on Earth will be the most unsuitable for humans to start living in?

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This project is a project that I have been doing with my professor David Rums.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, at the beginning of the speech, I want to give you a sentence first.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's see if it makes sense.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This sentence is like this.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He said that now on Earth,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
basically every place is suitable for living.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, every place, including the South Pole and the North Pole.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Can you think about it?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is this possible?

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In fact, it is possible.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
For example, what would we do if we were in a hotter place?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If it's really too hot, our temperature starts to rise.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then we may start to sweat.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sweating is a great heat dissipation mechanism.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because when the sweat evaporates, it can take away a lot of heat.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If it's in a colder place,

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
for example, the South Pole and the North Pole.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
At this time, of course, we don't need to sweat.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But we can, for example, put on clothes.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then, if necessary, we can start to tremble.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Trembling can increase our metabolism.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Metabolism will increase our body temperature.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So basically, whether you are in a hot place or a cold place,

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
our body temperature can remain stable.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Our body temperature is about 37 degrees Celsius.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When we do science, we use the Kepler scale.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's about 310 Kelvin.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is our standard body temperature.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If it's too hot, we sweat.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Keep your body cool and dissipate heat.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If it's too cold, we tremble.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Increase metabolism.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But this is the current state of the Earth.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Whether it's cold or hot,

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
we are all suitable for survival.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But if we ask a question now.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In the future, if the climate starts to warm up,

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
is the Earth still suitable for human survival?

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is it possible that in some places,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
because it's too hot,

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
even if we sweat,

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
we still can't survive.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Because our body temperature is too high,

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we can't survive.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is it possible?

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Basically, I want to answer this question.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If it happens in the future,

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
where will it happen?

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In which year?

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Before answering this question,

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we need to understand how the human body dissipates heat.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We have a very simple human model here.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This human model

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
basically divides the human body into two parts.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
One is our core.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The other is our skin surface.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The core and the skin surface

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
have their own temperature.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
T-Core refers to our core temperature.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's about 37 degrees Celsius.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
T-Skin refers to the surface temperature of our skin.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The surface temperature of the skin can be high or low.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For example, under the sun,

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the surface temperature of the skin may be higher.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In a cold place,

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the temperature of the skin will be lower.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But basically,

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
our core temperature

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is basically 37 degrees Celsius.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It won't change.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
After having this model,

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
we want to understand

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
under what circumstances

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
our core temperature will start to change.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll use a little bit of math here.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But don't worry.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There's no high-level knowledge in this math.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Basically, it's to tell us

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
how our core temperature changes with time.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I wrote something on the left.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's called the T-Core.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It means

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
how our core temperature changes with time.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The core temperature can rise or fall.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What makes it rise?

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
First, it's our metabolic rate.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The metabolic rate is the heat produced

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
by chemical changes in the human body.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For example, if we sit still

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and listen to a lecture,

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the metabolic rate is about 100 watts.

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
100 watts is the unit of energy.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The metabolic rate can increase our body temperature.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's very useful in winter.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you feel cold in winter,

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the metabolic rate will be higher.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It can increase our core temperature.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
After the heat is produced,

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
our core wants to dissipate the heat.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The mechanism to dissipate the heat

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
is conduction.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The core will transfer the heat

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
produced by the metabolic rate

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to our skin.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The skin is not an oil lamp.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
After it receives the heat,

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it will try to dissipate the same heat

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
into the atmosphere.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We can also write a similar formula.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is a mathematical detail.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because our skin is too small,

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the heat is very small.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We can assume that

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the temperature of our skin changes instantly.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It won't rise or fall like our body temperature.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I deliberately write 0 on the left side of the function.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is a mathematical technique.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We don't have to think about

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
how the skin changes at any time.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We only need to know

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
how the temperature of our skin changes.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How does the temperature of our skin change?

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
First, it will receive the heat

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
from the core,

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
which is conduction.

154
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Conduction will raise the temperature of our skin.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It can also dissipate the heat

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to the outside world,

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
which is heat loss to air.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is what it means.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's take a look at the first function.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know if you can see the mouse.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's okay.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Can you see the mouse?

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, thank you.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The meaning of the first function is

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
if the core temperature is higher,

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
it will raise the core temperature.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If the core temperature is higher,

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
as you can see the symbol,

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
it will lower the body temperature.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Basically, my body temperature

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
is determined by these two factors,

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
metabolism and conduction.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The temperature of my skin is the same.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Conduction will raise the temperature of my skin.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But it will also dissipate the heat to the outside world,

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
which is heat loss to air.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So the temperature of the skin will start to drop.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What we want to know is

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
what situation

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
will our core temperature

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
continue to rise

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and continue to drop?

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now let's take a look at the following function,

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
which is heat loss to air.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What kind of way does the skin

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
send heat to the atmosphere?

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There are three mechanisms.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I now change the function

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to three functions.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The first function is called long wave.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is long wave?

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Long wave is any object with temperature

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
will emit electromagnetic waves.

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The wavelength of the electromagnetic waves

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
is determined by the temperature of the object.

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
For example, the temperature of the sun is very high,

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
about 6000 degrees.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So the electromagnetic waves emitted

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
are very short.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Because the human body temperature

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
is only about 37 degrees Celsius,

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the atmosphere is about this temperature.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So the long wave emitted

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
is very long.

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So I wrote a long wave here.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It means that

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
compared with the electromagnetic waves of sunlight,

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the electromagnetic waves that the human body can emit

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
are very long.

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I call it long wave.

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The human body can dissipate heat

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
by the long wave.

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is the first mechanism.

214
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The second mechanism is sensible heat.

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
In Chinese,

216
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I checked it yesterday,

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
it should be called顯热,

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
which means obvious heat.

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It actually means

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the transmission between the skin and the atmosphere.

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That is to say,

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
if you encounter a cold air today,

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
your skin temperature will start to drop.

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If the temperature of the atmosphere is relatively high,

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
your skin temperature will start to rise.

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is sensible heat.

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The last one is called latent heat.

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Latent heat is called

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
潜热.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It means that

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
if you start to sweat now,

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and the skin is covered with sweat,

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
when the sweat starts to evaporate,

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
it can take away the temperature of the skin.

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is latent heat.

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Of course, if you want to say

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
if this person doesn't sweat,

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
then we don't have the third one.

239
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We only have the first two.

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So the third one must sweat

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
to be in here.

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Now let's think about

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the human body model.

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What kind of question do we want to answer?

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We want to ask

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
if we will die from too much heat in the future.

247
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So we imagine that

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
when you feel very hot,

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you may be dying soon.

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What would I do then?

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We may take off all our clothes.

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We may think,

253
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
forget it.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm dying soon,

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
so I'll take off all my clothes.

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
When you're not wearing clothes,

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
basically longwave and sensible heat

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
can work very well.

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Because you don't have clothes to block

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the heat between you and the atmosphere.

261
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So when we take off our clothes,

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
it actually helps dissipate the heat.

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
At the same time, we may be too hot,

264
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
so the whole body may be full of sweat.

265
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So the third one also exists.

266
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We hope that our human body surface

267
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
is full of sweat.

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Of course, you may think that

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
some people,

270
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
such as the elderly,

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
may not sweat much.

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
People like this

273
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
are not easy to dissipate heat.

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know why

275
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the elderly

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
don't know what the relationship is.

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Maybe it's because

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
their heat dissipation mechanism is poor.

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
One reason is that

280
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
they don't sweat much.

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But what we want to ask now is that

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
healthy people

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
can sweat moderately.

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
In this case,

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
will they still die in the future?

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So we're going to make

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
a very strong assumption now.

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's assume that

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
this human model

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
doesn't wear any clothes,

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and it's full of sweat.

292
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Assume no clothes,

293
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
now fully covered by sweat.

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is why our topic

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is called

296
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Sweaty Human in a GCM.

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Sweaty Human means

298
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
this person is full of sweat.

299
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
OK.

300
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So this is the first part of the topic.

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I have a question.

302
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes, please.

303
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have a question

304
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
about the sign

305
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
on your test paper.

306
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Today,

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
we all discussed that

308
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
inhabitable

309
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is mainly heat death,

310
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
not cold death,

311
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
right?

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes.

313
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If that's the case,

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I instinctively feel that

315
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
the T-core,

316
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the T,

317
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
should be positive.

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But if it's positive,

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the higher the conduction,

320
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the higher the temperature.

321
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So how do you define

322
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
the sign now?

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't understand.

324
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
OK.

325
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Very good.

326
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If the conduction is positive,

327
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that means

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
the heat is

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
from the core

330
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to the surface of the skin.

331
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So this arrow

332
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
means

333
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the direction of conduction.

334
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If the conduction

335
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
is negative,

336
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
that means

337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the heat is

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
from the skin to the core.

339
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So now,

340
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
if I'm not mistaken,

341
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the condition of death

342
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
is

343
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
T,

344
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
T,

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
T,

346
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
T,

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
T,

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
T,

349
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
T,

350
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
T,

351
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
T,

352
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
T,

353
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
T,

354
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
T,

355
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
T,

356
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
T,

357
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
T,

358
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
T,

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
T,

360
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
T,

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
T,

362
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
T,

363
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
T,

364
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
T,

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
T,

366
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
T,

367
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
T,

368
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
T,

369
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
T,

370
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
T,

371
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
T,

372
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
T,

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
T,

374
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
T,

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
