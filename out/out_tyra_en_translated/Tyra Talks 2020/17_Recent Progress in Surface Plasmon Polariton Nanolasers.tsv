0	8000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tire Talk. I'm your host, Yen-Yong Zhang.
8000	16000	We're very honored to have Timothy here today. He's a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Chengda University.
16000	21000	Today's topic is Recent Progress in Surface Plasmon Polariton Nanolasers.
21000	25000	Before we start, let me introduce Tim.
26000	32000	First of all, I want to say that Tim's introduction is so cool and short.
32000	34000	But I want to say that he only wrote a few words. He wrote,
34000	37000	Proud Kaohsiunger 666.
37000	43000	This was sent to me a few days before the election.
43000	48000	So I have to go to his personal website to see his self-introduction.
48000	52000	Yes, I have it now. You can take a look.
52000	54000	Okay, I have the website.
54000	56000	Let me introduce him.
56000	61000	Tim's background is physics.
61000	63000	He majored in physics at Chengda University.
63000	65000	He got his Ph.D. at Chengda University.
65000	73000	In addition to physics, he is also passionate about investment, hiking, philosophy, and social movements.
73000	77000	I know you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.
78000	82000	No, I got my Ph.D. at NCT.
82000	84000	Oh, NCT. I misread it. Sorry.
84000	88000	Okay, you got your Ph.D. at Chengda University.
88000	96000	Did you go to Michigan and Tel Aviv to do a postdoc program for a period of time before returning to Taiwan?
96000	101000	No, I went to Michigan with a visa from the Ministry of Science and Technology.
101000	110000	My boss, Denghui, recommended me to go to the University of Israel.
110000	116000	I went to the University of Israel and did a postdoc program for about a year.
116000	119000	And then you went back to Chengda University.
119000	120000	Yes, that's right.
120000	128000	Okay, so this is the bio of Yuxun from the proud Kaohsiunger666.
129000	132000	Okay, let's get started.
132000	137000	Okay, today, considering that everyone has different backgrounds,
137000	140000	I'm going to talk a little bit about what we do in the light study department.
140000	145000	Roughly speaking, it can be shown as shown in the picture.
145000	149000	We will create light.
149000	158000	Then we will find a way to transmit light, detect light, and control light.
158000	160000	This is what we do in the light study department.
160000	171000	Our department covers all aspects of basic physics, including ray optics, wave optics, electronics, and quantum mechanics.
171000	178000	In the light study department, as you can see, we have a very wide range of applications.
178000	184000	For example, you can see the screen on your phone or the LED light for lighting.
184000	188000	There is also a solar panel that is currently out of energy,
188000	191000	as well as the light you need to use when you go online.
191000	197000	Some parts of your iPhone are cut off with high-power laser.
197000	201000	A more advanced application is the part of the collective light path.
201000	209000	So light basically covers a lot of subjects and applications.
209000	215000	These are the parts that are usually easier to see.
215000	218000	I would like to emphasize a little further here.
218000	226000	The part of the light study field basically contributed 30% of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the past half century.
226000	232000	This data was obtained from the OSA, the light study department.
232000	239000	In other words, the part related to light won the 30% physics award.
239000	244000	You can see that light technology is a very important subject.
244000	248000	It is a very worthwhile project for everyone to invest in.
248000	256000	Personally, I focus my research on how to create light.
256000	262000	If you want to create light, you must know that energy and matter are basically inseparable.
262000	268000	The creation of energy must involve matter, and the stability of matter must also involve energy.
269000	280000	Here, I mainly focus on the interaction between light and matter, especially the polariton part.
280000	285000	Polariton is basically a mixture of light and exciton.
285000	292000	Based on such a large structure, my current research topic is microcavity polariton laser,
292000	295000	and surface plasmon polariton laser.
295000	303000	In order to produce these components, I did some basic research on some novel materials.
303000	313000	Back to the laser part, as I mentioned earlier, my research focuses on the interaction between light and matter.
313000	319000	I hope to be able to produce light, because light is the most basic part of light science.
319000	326000	If you can't produce light, you won't be able to control light, guide light, or detect light.
326000	331000	Here, I want to talk about what a laser is.
331000	336000	The abbreviation for laser is LASER.
336000	345000	Its full name is Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation.
345000	352000	The concept of light amplification radiation was first proposed by Einstein around 1918.
352000	358000	At that time, he proposed the interaction between light and matter, which can be roughly divided into three categories.
358000	363000	Laser absorption, laser emission, and self-emission.
363000	368000	Now, let me talk about what laser emission is.
368000	373000	You will often see some animation characters on TV.
373000	378000	They will start to emit gas, and then release gas, or release some big waves.
378000	383000	A more famous example is the gas bomb in Dragon Ball.
383000	386000	Or like the famous character in the movie, Huo Ying Ren Zhe.
386000	389000	The concept is similar to the concept of gathering Chakra.
389000	394000	If you are watching a movie or anime, you can understand.
394000	397000	Laser is a bit similar to this concept.
397000	405000	Its principle is basically to amplify your signal, your energy.
405000	408000	The process is like this.
408000	411000	First, you will have a passive electron.
411000	412000	It is in the high-energy state.
412000	418000	Then, it is affected by a photon.
418000	422000	So that it goes from high-energy to low-energy.
422000	428000	As it goes from high-energy state to low-energy state, it will emit the same light.
428000	434000	The same light as the input signal, including its position and wavelength.
434000	438000	Through this process, one chakra pushes two chakras.
438000	440000	Two chakras pushes four chakras.
440000	444000	In this way, it can achieve the amplification of energy.
444000	449000	If we can effectively use this passive radiation,
449000	453000	we can create the so-called laser component.
453000	458000	The laser component is very similar to what you have experienced.
458000	462000	Those who have played laser pen or laser know that
462000	464000	the more famous properties of laser are
464000	470000	it is monochromatic, it has directivity, and it has very good tonality.
470000	472000	If you use these features,
472000	475000	the laser can be used as a detector,
475000	477000	it can be used as a scanner,
477000	479000	it can be used as a DVD player,
479000	483000	it can be used for surgery.
483000	485000	OK.
485000	487000	Here, you may think,
487000	490000	why do I put a picture of Einstein?
490000	492000	First of all, when it comes to laser,
492000	494000	for people my age,
494000	498000	the first thing that comes to mind is the Death Star in Star Wars.
498000	504000	The Death Star is a very iconic thing.
504000	509000	In Star Wars, it only took 17 seconds to destroy an entire planet.
509000	512000	Then you will see that it starts to gather laser light,
512000	515000	then it gathers a little more, and then it destroys a planet.
515000	519000	So when it comes to Star Wars,
519000	521000	I have to mention Einstein.
521000	524000	You may think, why?
524000	528000	First of all, in a recent interview,
528000	531000	a reporter asked George Lucas,
531000	535000	where did the image of Master Yoda come from?
535000	539000	Lucas said, it actually came from Einstein.
539000	542000	Because he needed someone who looked crazy,
542000	545000	but also very powerful, to be the prototype of his image.
545000	549000	So Einstein is basically the prototype of Master Yoda.
549000	553000	Einstein also inspired the development of laser.
553000	556000	He was the first to propose laser beam magnification.
556000	558000	After 40 years of hard work,
558000	561000	Tons and Shallow, these two excellent scientists,
561000	564000	in the 1950s or so,
564000	569000	proposed a truly feasible model of laser components.
569000	574000	Of course, at that time, they didn't really make laser beam.
574000	584000	This concept was learned by someone in the lab next door.
584000	587000	Then in the 1960s,
587000	591000	they made the first laser.
591000	595000	So from the 1960s to 2020,
595000	598000	it happened to be the 60th anniversary of laser.
598000	604000	In the past 60 years,
604000	609000	at least 7 Nobel Prizes were awarded to laser technology.
609000	612000	Why do I say directly?
612000	614000	Broadly speaking,
614000	618000	Nobel Prizes related to laser technology are actually countless.
618000	620000	For example,
620000	623000	last year's Nobel Prize for Gravity Wave Experiment
623000	626000	was awarded to gravity wave detection.
626000	629000	Gravity wave detection also relies on laser technology.
629000	633000	Of course, it's not a Nobel Prize directly related to laser technology.
633000	637000	However, gravity wave detection must rely on laser.
637000	641000	Last year's Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to astronomy.
641000	647000	Astronomy also requires high-precision measurements using laser.
647000	650000	So it can be seen that
650000	658000	laser has a significant impact on the development of human science.
658000	663000	The last Nobel Prize for Laser Technology was awarded in 2018.
663000	669000	It was awarded to three very important scientists.
669000	672000	Yashijin, Mooroo, and Shukla.
672000	677000	They have made very original breakthroughs
677000	681000	in the application of small and large-power lasers.
681000	683000	Yashijin in particular,
683000	686000	has invented light-transmission technology.
686000	689000	Mooroo and Shukla
689000	693000	have used the method of bombardment
693000	698000	to compress the pulse of the laser to a very high energy density.
698000	702000	Today, we have all kinds of large-power lasers
702000	706000	that can be used in science and technology.
706000	709000	When it comes to large-power laser applications,
709000	711000	we think of destruction.
711000	713000	Not only can lasers be used to destroy,
713000	717000	but they can also be used for precise destruction.
717000	719000	This is an example I just gave.
719000	722000	In the metal phone case you are using now,
722000	724000	or some precision components,
724000	727000	we use laser to cut metal surfaces,
727000	730000	to cut surfaces of different materials,
730000	736000	to create micro-level, fine structures.
736000	739000	However, in addition to destruction,
739000	742000	lasers can also be used for creation.
742000	744000	If you look up at the sun in the sky,
744000	746000	although it should be night in North America,
746000	748000	but here we are in the morning,
748000	749000	and it's almost noon,
749000	751000	so if you look up at the sky,
751000	753000	you will see a bright red sun.
753000	757000	It's actually a fusion phenomenon.
757000	761000	We can use hundreds of lasers
761000	765000	to focus on the same small point
765000	769000	to create a fusion reaction.
769000	771000	So lasers can not only be used for destruction,
771000	774000	but they can also be used for creation.
774000	776000	On the other hand, when it comes to small-power lasers,
776000	778000	they are more peaceful.
778000	780000	They are mainly used for detection,
781000	784000	measurement, and transmission.
784000	786000	According to the self-driving technology
786000	789000	that you often see on TV,
789000	793000	there are about three or four detection technologies,
793000	796000	including ultrasonic, visual recognition,
796000	802000	light sensing, and...
802000	803000	Let me think about it.
803000	805000	It's about these three.
805000	807000	Among them, the so-called light sensor,
807000	809000	which is called LIDAR in English,
809000	811000	is mainly used by lasers
811000	815000	to accurately measure the surrounding environment.
815000	818000	Because lasers are very high-precision,
818000	821000	they have very good synchronization.
821000	823000	So when the laser beam hits the object,
823000	827000	it can very accurately detect
827000	830000	the distance between the object and the sensor
830000	832000	to avoid your self-driving car
832000	834000	hitting the objects around it.
834000	836000	If you are not familiar with self-driving cars
836000	839000	or if you are not familiar with LIDAR technology,
839000	842000	you can see the iPhone.
842000	845000	If you have an iPhone 10
845000	848000	or if you have an iPhone 10 or above,
848000	852000	you can see that there is a sensor bar on it.
852000	853000	In this sensor bar,
853000	854000	there is a part of it
854000	858000	that is filled with laser sensors.
858000	863000	Apple engineers have filled hundreds of vertical laser sensors
863000	867000	with LIDAR technology.
867000	870000	These lasers can project more than 30,000 light spots
870000	872000	every second
872000	875000	to detect the surface of your face
875000	879000	to identify whether you are a legitimate user of this phone.
879000	881000	So you might think that
881000	884000	we can already fill hundreds of lasers
884000	888000	in the size of a miliband.
888000	892000	Is it necessary to continue to reduce the number of lasers?
892000	895000	In fact, it is necessary.
895000	899000	Let me give you a brief description of our needs.
899000	902000	You can see the image in the upper right corner.
902000	906000	It is from Intel's Tech News Room.
906000	908000	Okay.
908000	910000	In the past few decades,
910000	912000	you must have heard in the news
912000	916000	that TSMC has broken through the 14-nm technology.
916000	918000	They built a 7-nm factory.
918000	920000	Next, a 5-nm factory.
920000	922000	Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.
922000	924000	Next, a 5-nm factory in the U.S.
924000	925000	Next, a 3-nm factory in the U.S.
925000	927000	The number of nanometers
927000	929000	refers to the width of the device.
929000	930000	The number of nanometers
930000	932000	refers to the width of the device.
932000	934000	You will find that the number
934000	936000	ranges from large to small.
936000	939000	We have been making these devices smaller.
939000	941000	When we make these devices smaller,
941000	943000	there is a serious problem.
943000	946000	First, let me jump off the topic of the speech
946000	948000	and talk to you about it.
948000	950000	You can imagine
950000	952000	if you have 100 lines
952000	955000	from Taipei to Kaohsiung.
955000	957000	In this case,
957000	958000	I can assure you that
958000	960000	there will be almost no traffic.
960000	962000	But when you reduce 100 lines
962000	964000	to 50 lines,
964000	965000	25 lines,
965000	966000	10 lines,
966000	967000	5 lines,
967000	968000	3 lines,
968000	970000	or even 1 line,
970000	972000	the same traffic will cause
972000	974000	a very serious problem.
974000	976000	Your car may collide with each other.
976000	978000	You may fall off the highway.
978000	980000	The traffic may never be resolved.
980000	982000	This is the problem we face
982000	984000	when using electronic components.
984000	986000	Electronic components rely on electronic transmission.
986000	988000	The interaction between electronic and electronic
988000	990000	has the effect of the torque.
990000	992000	This torque
992000	994000	is multiplied by the square of the distance.
994000	996000	In other words,
996000	998000	when your line width is getting narrower,
998000	1000000	the interference between electronic and electronic
1000000	1002000	will become very strong.
1002000	1004000	This interference
1004000	1006000	will cause
1006000	1008000	80% of the signal
1008000	1010000	in the electronic component
1010000	1012000	to be lost
1012000	1014000	in interconnection.
1014000	1016000	This value is
1016000	1018000	about 2 picojoules
1018000	1020000	per bit per centimeter.
1020000	1022000	You may think that
1022000	1024000	picojoules are about 10 to the power of 12.
1024000	1026000	And it's per centimeter.
1026000	1028000	It feels okay.
1028000	1030000	But don't forget
1030000	1032000	that in our daily lives,
1032000	1034000	all kinds of applications
1034000	1036000	and all kinds of
1036000	1038000	online activities
1038000	1040000	are connected
1040000	1042000	to several megabytes at any time.
1042000	1044000	Even if you
1044000	1046000	want to watch
1046000	1048000	4K videos,
1048000	1050000	you may be connected
1050000	1052000	to terabytes of
1052000	1054000	information.
1054000	1056000	So,
1056000	1058000	under these conditions,
1058000	1060000	the world is
1060000	1062000	actually
1062000	1064000	wasting a lot of
1064000	1066000	energy on
1066000	1068000	electrical interconnection.
1068000	1070000	If you don't have much
1070000	1072000	knowledge about information flow,
1072000	1074000	you can think in another way.
1074000	1076000	The mobile chip
1076000	1078000	and computer chip
1078000	1080000	we are using now
1080000	1082000	have billions of components.
1082000	1084000	Okay?
1084000	1086000	Each component consumes 2 picojoules
1086000	1088000	per second.
1088000	1090000	In the long run,
1090000	1092000	it's a huge energy loss.
1092000	1094000	So, under these
1094000	1096000	background conditions,
1096000	1098000	people start to think about
1098000	1100000	using light transmission
1100000	1102000	instead of electronic transmission.
1102000	1104000	Okay?
1104000	1106000	Light will not
1106000	1108000	interfere with each other.
1108000	1110000	And you can put different
1110000	1112000	wavelengths of light
1112000	1114000	in the same optical channel.
1114000	1116000	So, if you use light
1116000	1118000	to transmit a signal,
1118000	1120000	it's about 10 picojoules
1120000	1122000	per centimeter.
1122000	1124000	If you use electricity
1124000	1126000	to transmit a signal,
1126000	1128000	it's about 1 to 2 orders
1128000	1130000	less,
1130000	1132000	which is about 100 times less.
1132000	1134000	Okay?
1134000	1136000	If we want to use light
1136000	1138000	to transmit a signal,
1138000	1140000	there must be a wavelength.
1140000	1142000	And this wavelength
1142000	1144000	must be the same
1144000	1146000	as the current
1146000	1148000	electronic component technology.
1148000	1150000	The so-called matching
1150000	1152000	is that its volume
1152000	1154000	should be about the same.
1154000	1156000	Okay?
1156000	1158000	If you want to use
1158000	1160000	a table-shaped laser
1160000	1162000	to replace our electronic
1162000	1164000	component transmission,
1164000	1166000	it's actually unrealistic
1166000	1168000	because it's a little bit of ink.
1168000	1170000	We ultimately hope
1170000	1172000	that we can make a component
1172000	1174000	that is completely different from
1174000	1176000	the electronic component
1176000	1178000	and can be perfectly integrated
1178000	1180000	into the existing technology.
1180000	1182000	Okay?
1182000	1184000	So you might want to
1184000	1186000	reduce the volume of the laser.
1186000	1188000	But there's a problem here.
1188000	1190000	And this problem
1190000	1192000	has been a problem
1192000	1194000	for engineers and scientists
1194000	1196000	for a while.
1196000	1198000	This problem is
1198000	1200000	the optical wavelength limit.
1200000	1202000	The optical wavelength limit
1202000	1204000	tells us that
1204000	1206000	if you want to limit a light,
1206000	1208000	the size of your component,
1208000	1210000	the dimension of your component
1210000	1212000	must be greater than
1212000	1214000	or equal to the wavelength of the light wave.
1214000	1216000	Actually, it's easy to imagine.
1216000	1218000	If you want to put an elephant
1218000	1220000	in your refrigerator today,
1220000	1222000	it's impossible because
1222000	1224000	your refrigerator is smaller
1224000	1226000	than the size of the elephant.
1226000	1228000	So you can't effectively
1228000	1230000	put an elephant in your refrigerator.
1230000	1232000	In the same way,
1232000	1234000	in the field of optics,
1234000	1236000	the wavelength limit is
1236000	1238000	a basic obstacle.
1238000	1240000	You can't
1240000	1242000	limit the light
1242000	1244000	to something
1244000	1246000	smaller than it.
1246000	1248000	So,
1248000	1250000	in order to overcome this obstacle,
1250000	1252000	scientists
1252000	1254000	began to think
1254000	1256000	about other ways
1256000	1258000	to make
1258000	1260000	laser.
1260000	1262000	They thought about other ways
1262000	1264000	to make nanoparticles.
1264000	1266000	OK.
1266000	1268000	First of all,
1268000	1270000	back to what I said at the beginning,
1270000	1272000	I mentioned that
1272000	1274000	laser is like
1274000	1276000	a machine.
1276000	1278000	If we look at some
1278000	1280000	elite novels or
1280000	1282000	elite movies,
1282000	1284000	those masters,
1284000	1286000	they sometimes need to
1286000	1288000	concentrate their energy
1288000	1290000	and then
1290000	1292000	send out their
1292000	1294000	air force.
1294000	1296000	OK.
1296000	1298000	So,
1298000	1300000	when you can't
1300000	1302000	effectively execute
1302000	1304000	your work,
1304000	1306000	you can accumulate
1306000	1308000	energy in another way.
1308000	1310000	What does it mean?
1310000	1312000	It's like you change from
1312000	1314000	a computer system or a
1314000	1316000	magic system to a chakra system.
1316000	1318000	In my opinion,
1318000	1320000	they are all energy systems.
1320000	1322000	Each energy system
1322000	1324000	has its own characteristics.
1324000	1326000	In our field,
1326000	1328000	we transform
1328000	1330000	the process of
1330000	1332000	magnification of
1332000	1334000	laser into another form,
1334000	1336000	which is called
1336000	1338000	surface electromagnetic field.
1338000	1340000	Today,
1340000	1342000	I don't want to practice
1342000	1344000	Chinese martial arts anymore.
1344000	1346000	I want to practice western magic.
1346000	1348000	I can also let
1348000	1350000	magic operate in my body.
1350000	1352000	And because magic
1352000	1354000	has a relatively small energy volume,
1354000	1356000	I can more effectively
1356000	1358000	accumulate energy in my body
1358000	1360000	to have a better output.
1360000	1362000	So, the concept is similar.
1362000	1364000	Engineers
1364000	1366000	and scientists
1366000	1368000	want to
1368000	1370000	replace a
1370000	1372000	smaller object
1372000	1374000	with a
1374000	1376000	smaller object,
1376000	1378000	which is called
1378000	1380000	surface electromagnetic field.
1380000	1382000	Surface electromagnetic field
1382000	1384000	is the electromagnetization
1384000	1386000	of the collective vibration
1386000	1388000	on the metal surface.
1388000	1390000	If it can
1390000	1392000	coalesce with light,
1392000	1394000	it can produce a new thing
1394000	1396000	called surface plasma polarity.
1396000	1398000	Surface plasma polarity
1398000	1400000	has some features,
1400000	1402000	such as its wavelength
1402000	1404000	is smaller than the wavelength
1404000	1406000	of light waves,
1406000	1408000	and it has a very fast
1408000	1410000	reaction speed.
1410000	1412000	It can also be controlled
1412000	1414000	by electromagnetic field.
1414000	1416000	So, when I go into
1416000	1418000	the more detailed part,
1418000	1420000	I will first mention
1420000	1422000	the magical part of
1422000	1424000	surface plasma.
1424000	1426000	If you have read this book,
1426000	1428000	it is called
1428000	1430000	Ligricus Cup.
1430000	1432000	It is a cup
1432000	1434000	of a king
1434000	1436000	in the 4th century
1436000	1438000	in Rome.
1438000	1440000	This cup has a
1440000	1442000	very special feature.
1442000	1444000	When you hit the light
1444000	1446000	from the inside of the cup
1446000	1448000	to the outside,
1448000	1450000	you will see red light.
1450000	1452000	When you hit the light
1452000	1454000	from the inside of the cup
1454000	1456000	to the outside,
1456000	1458000	you will see green light.
1458000	1460000	Scientists have been
1460000	1462000	confused about this problem
1462000	1464000	since the 1980s.
1464000	1466000	They do not know
1466000	1468000	what the principle of operation
1468000	1470000	of this thing is.
1470000	1472000	Later, they did
1472000	1474000	elemental analysis
1474000	1476000	and found that
1476000	1478000	most of this cup
1478000	1480000	is made of silicon oxide,
1480000	1482000	so that they can
1482000	1484000	react with the light
1484000	1486000	and produce surface plasma.
1486000	1488000	They can effectively
1488000	1490000	concentrate the energy
1490000	1492000	in a very small area
1492000	1494000	to absorb, diffuse
1494000	1496000	or magnify.
1496000	1498000	Let's go back to the Ligricus Cup.
1498000	1500000	Why does it have
1500000	1502000	this special feature?
1502000	1504000	The outside of the cup
1504000	1506000	is red,
1506000	1508000	but the inside is green.
1508000	1510000	This is because
1510000	1512000	the gold nanoparticles
1512000	1514000	will be absorbed
1514000	1516000	by the green light
1516000	1518000	of 520 nanometers.
1518000	1520000	The surface plasma will
1520000	1522000	absorb the energy.
1522000	1524000	When you hit the light
1524000	1526000	from the inside to the outside,
1526000	1528000	the green light is absorbed
1528000	1530000	and only the red light
1530000	1532000	is reflected.
1532000	1534000	Why is the outside
1534000	1536000	of the cup green?
1536000	1538000	When you hit the light from the inside
1538000	1540000	to the outside,
1540000	1542000	the green light
1542000	1544000	of 520 nanometers
1544000	1546000	will be absorbed
1546000	1548000	by the gold nanoparticles
1548000	1550000	in the cup.
1550000	1552000	The green light
1552000	1554000	will be absorbed
1554000	1556000	by the gold nanoparticles
1556000	1558000	in the cup.
1558000	1560000	The green light
1560000	1562000	will be absorbed
1562000	1564000	by the gold nanoparticles
1564000	1566000	in the cup.
1566000	1568000	This is because
1568000	1570000	the surface plasma
1570000	1572000	is very close to the gold nanoparticles.
1572000	1574000	When we see red,
1574000	1576000	we think it is ruby,
1576000	1578000	and green means
1578000	1580000	it is emerald.
1580000	1582000	But these two cups
1582000	1584000	neither have gold nanoparticles
1584000	1586000	nor sapphire nanoparticles.
1586000	1588000	They are just
1588000	1590000	metal particles
1590000	1592000	mixed with silicon oxide.
1592000	1594000	Let's talk about
1594000	1596000	the basic properties of metal.
1598000	1600000	Metal
1600000	1602000	due to its low electromagnetic
1602000	1604000	coating,
1604000	1606000	can not fill
1606000	1608000	the chamber effectively.
1608000	1610000	So, in a metal block,
1610000	1612000	the electrons can move freely
1612000	1614000	without any interference.
1614000	1616000	It will be in an inverted state.
1616000	1618000	So, for this type of block,
1618000	1620000	its capacitance
1620000	1622000	can be described
1622000	1624000	by a model called
1624000	1626000	Joule model.
1626000	1628000	This model
1628000	1630000	uses background capacitance
1630000	1632000	to subtract the surface plasma
1632000	1634000	resonance frequency
1634000	1636000	minus the resonance frequency
1636000	1638000	plus a damping term.
1640000	1642000	Surface plasma frequency
1642000	1644000	refers to
1644000	1646000	what kind of frequency
1646000	1648000	it will resonate with.
1648000	1650000	In the future,
1650000	1652000	when we play in the park,
1652000	1654000	we will often
1654000	1656000	swing a swing.
1656000	1658000	A swing has
1658000	1660000	a swing frequency.
1660000	1662000	When you sit on it,
1662000	1664000	you will find that
1664000	1666000	if you can swing
1666000	1668000	along the swing frequency,
1668000	1670000	you can swing
1670000	1672000	the swing high and far
1672000	1674000	very quickly.
1674000	1676000	In the same way,
1676000	1678000	every object
1678000	1680000	has its own resonance frequency.
1680000	1682000	The resonance frequency of metal
1682000	1684000	we call it
1684000	1686000	Joule frequency.
1686000	1688000	This Joule frequency
1688000	1690000	refers to
1690000	1692000	when a beam of light
1692000	1694000	comes in,
1694000	1696000	the electrons in the metal
1696000	1698000	will resonate
1698000	1700000	with the light.
1700000	1702000	When the resonance frequency
1702000	1704000	is consistent with the resonance frequency of metal,
1704000	1706000	it will have the greatest absorption.
1706000	1708000	In this case,
1708000	1710000	we call
1710000	1712000	this resonance frequency
1712000	1714000	as
1714000	1716000	Joule frequency.
1716000	1718000	Joule frequency is
1718000	1720000	proportional to the
1720000	1722000	root of the electron number.
1722000	1724000	This N is the electron number.
1724000	1726000	Q is the electron number.
1726000	1728000	Me is the electron quality.
1728000	1730000	Epsilon zero is the background
1730000	1732000	charge.
1732000	1734000	Normally,
1734000	1736000	the electron density
1736000	1738000	of metal is
1738000	1740000	10 to the power of 25 to the power of 26
1740000	1742000	cubic meters.
1742000	1744000	This is the electron density of metal.
1744000	1746000	In the physics of quantum mechanics,
1746000	1748000	we know that
1748000	1750000	light
1750000	1752000	is composed of frequency
1752000	1754000	and wavelength.
1754000	1756000	Light is composed of frequency
1756000	1758000	and wavelength.
1758000	1760000	Once you know the resonance frequency,
1760000	1762000	you can push
1762000	1764000	the wavelength
1764000	1766000	in the opposite direction.
1766000	1768000	Once again,
1768000	1770000	Omega P is the
1770000	1772000	resonance frequency of electron.
1772000	1774000	Once you know the resonance frequency of electron,
1774000	1776000	you will know the wavelength of electron.
1776000	1778000	This wavelength
1778000	1780000	is about
1780000	1782000	10 to 100 nanometer.
1782000	1784000	It is smaller than
1784000	1786000	the wavelength of visible light.
1786000	1788000	When we add a piece of metal
1788000	1790000	and connect it
1790000	1792000	to an electrolytic layer,
1792000	1794000	it will form
1794000	1796000	a surface electrode.
1796000	1798000	The electrode
1798000	1800000	we just talked about
1800000	1802000	is a three-dimensional electrode.
1802000	1804000	Now, we reduce
1804000	1806000	its dimension
1806000	1808000	to two dimensions.
1808000	1810000	These surface electrodes
1810000	1812000	can only be compensated
1812000	1814000	on the surface of metal and electrolyte.
1814000	1816000	This compensation
1816000	1818000	will produce
1818000	1820000	a smaller
1820000	1822000	resonance frequency,
1822000	1824000	which is called surface electrode frequency.
1824000	1826000	Surface electrode frequency
1826000	1828000	is the electrode frequency
1828000	1830000	divided by the root of
1830000	1832000	E plus Epsilon D.
1832000	1834000	Epsilon D is the
1834000	1836000	capacitance of the electrolyte.
1836000	1838000	So,
1838000	1840000	the surface electrode
1840000	1842000	will have a dispersion curve
1842000	1844000	like this.
1844000	1846000	From this
1846000	1848000	dispersion curve,
1848000	1850000	we can see that
1850000	1852000	the surface electrode
1852000	1854000	has a dispersion curve
1854000	1856000	with a very large
1856000	1858000	momentum,
1858000	1860000	which is close to
1860000	1862000	the water level.
1862000	1864000	If it is close to the water level,
1864000	1866000	it means that
1866000	1868000	its wavelength is zero.
1868000	1870000	We know that
1870000	1872000	in basic light theory,
1872000	1874000	the dispersion curve
1874000	1876000	of light
1876000	1878000	is divided by
1878000	1880000	its speed,
1880000	1882000	which is the speed of light
1882000	1884000	in the ring.
1884000	1886000	Similarly,
1886000	1888000	the surface electrode dispersion curve
1888000	1890000	is divided by
1890000	1892000	the speed of light
1892000	1894000	in the ring.
1894000	1896000	And,
1896000	1898000	the wavelength is zero,
1898000	1900000	which means that
1900000	1902000	its speed of light
1902000	1904000	in the ring
1904000	1906000	is very slow.
1906000	1908000	Its speed of light
1908000	1910000	in the ring
1910000	1912000	is very slow,
1912000	1914000	which means that
1914000	1916000	it will exist for a very long time.
1916000	1918000	And,
1918000	1920000	it will have a very strong interaction
1920000	1922000	between light and matter.
1922000	1924000	Let's imagine that
1924000	1926000	there is a smoke truck
1926000	1928000	in front of you
1928000	1930000	and you inhale the exhaust gas.
1930000	1932000	If the speed of the truck is very slow,
1932000	1934000	you will inhale a lot of exhaust gas.
1934000	1936000	If the speed of the truck is very fast,
1936000	1938000	you will pass through the snow
1938000	1940000	and you will not inhale the gas.
1940000	1942000	So,
1942000	1944000	in our research,
1944000	1946000	the slower the speed of
1946000	1948000	the surface electrode movement,
1948000	1950000	the better.
1950000	1952000	This means that
1952000	1954000	it can have a very strong interaction
1954000	1956000	with the ring.
1956000	1958000	OK.
1958000	1960000	Now,
1960000	1962000	let's take a look at
1962000	1964000	how to do it.
1964000	1966000	It's actually very simple.
1966000	1968000	That is to say,
1968000	1970000	as soon as you see it,
1970000	1972000	you will think,
1972000	1974000	how can there be such a simple structure?
1974000	1976000	In order to achieve the goal
1976000	1978000	of limiting energy
1978000	1980000	by using the surface electrode,
1980000	1982000	we adopted the SIN structure.
1982000	1984000	This structure
1984000	1986000	was proposed by
1986000	1988000	Prof. Chang and his team
1988000	1990000	in 2009.
1990000	1992000	It is mainly made up of
1992000	1994000	a semiconductor nanocircuit,
1994000	1996000	a metal layer,
1996000	1998000	and an insulator
1998000	2000000	in the middle
2000000	2002000	to form the SIN structure.
2002000	2004000	The metal layer
2004000	2006000	is responsible for producing
2006000	2008000	the surface electrode.
2008000	2010000	The nanocircuit
2010000	2012000	is responsible for providing
2012000	2014000	the insulator.
2014000	2016000	The insulator
2016000	2018000	is responsible for
2018000	2020000	reducing the energy loss
2020000	2022000	and protecting
2022000	2024000	the metal layer.
2024000	2026000	So,
2026000	2028000	we can quickly understand
2028000	2030000	the whole process
2030000	2032000	through this animation.
2032000	2034000	To make such a laser,
2034000	2036000	we first have to
2036000	2038000	put a metal layer
2038000	2040000	on top of it
2040000	2042000	and then
2042000	2044000	put a nanocircuit on top of it.
2044000	2046000	The nanocircuit will provide
2046000	2048000	a light-dissipation.
2048000	2050000	The light-dissipation will
2050000	2052000	convert the energy
2052000	2054000	to the Surface Plasma Mode.
2054000	2056000	The Surface Plasma Mode
2056000	2058000	can reach the collector
2058000	2060000	along the
2060000	2062000	natural laser rectifier
2062000	2064000	and finally
2064000	2066000	release the energy
2066000	2068000	at the end of the laser.
2068000	2070000	The Surface Plasma Mode
2070000	2072000	has a wavelength
2072000	2074000	of tens of nanometers.
2074000	2076000	In other words,
2076000	2078000	we can break
2078000	2080000	the light-dissipation limit
2080000	2082000	and reduce the size
2082000	2084000	of such elements
2084000	2086000	to less than
2086000	2088000	the wavelength of the light wave.
2092000	2094000	Excuse me,
2094000	2096000	can I ask some questions?
2096000	2098000	Sorry, my name is Ted.
2098000	2100000	Can we go back
2100000	2102000	to the previous video?
2104000	2106000	The one before the animation.
2106000	2108000	The one before the animation.
2108000	2110000	This is the one before the animation.
2110000	2112000	What does SPP mean?
2112000	2114000	Sorry,
2114000	2116000	this is one of the questions.
2116000	2118000	SPP is...
2118000	2120000	Surface Plasma Polariton.
2120000	2122000	It is a mixture of
2122000	2124000	surface electrons and light-dissipation.
2124000	2126000	I see.
2126000	2128000	I remember that
2128000	2130000	laser requires
2130000	2132000	inversion population.
2132000	2134000	Can you describe
2134000	2136000	what is the
2136000	2138000	inversion population
2138000	2140000	in the
2140000	2142000	SPP?
2146000	2148000	First of all,
2148000	2150000	this is our
2150000	2152000	model.
2152000	2154000	The traditional
2154000	2156000	laser uses
2156000	2158000	optical rectifier
2158000	2160000	to
2160000	2162000	rectify the light
2162000	2164000	in the rectifier.
2164000	2166000	In other words,
2166000	2168000	the light will eat
2168000	2170000	many optical gates.
2170000	2172000	This type of
2172000	2174000	laser
2174000	2176000	has the same concept.
2176000	2178000	It just changes
2178000	2180000	the light,
2180000	2182000	which is replaced by
2182000	2184000	surface electrons.
2184000	2186000	It uses SPP
2186000	2188000	to rectify the light
2188000	2190000	in the rectifier.
2190000	2192000	You can look at
2192000	2194000	this picture.
2194000	2196000	At first,
2196000	2198000	we will
2198000	2200000	shoot a laser beam
2200000	2202000	to activate the
2202000	2204000	semiconductor material.
2204000	2206000	During the activation,
2206000	2208000	it will form
2208000	2210000	a crystal.
2210000	2212000	This crystal
2212000	2214000	will contribute
2214000	2216000	energy to
2216000	2218000	the plasma.
2218000	2220000	Just like the traditional
2220000	2222000	optical laser,
2222000	2224000	the light will
2224000	2226000	rectify the light
2226000	2228000	in the rectifier.
2228000	2230000	This is
2230000	2232000	what I want to answer.
2234000	2236000	Did I answer
2236000	2238000	your question?
2238000	2240000	No.
2240000	2242000	I think you
2242000	2244000	just mentioned it.
2244000	2246000	It's okay.
2246000	2248000	You can look at
2248000	2250000	the length of the nanowire
2250000	2252000	and some basic
2252000	2254000	information.
2254000	2256000	The animation
2256000	2258000	looks like
2258000	2260000	you don't know much about it.
2260000	2262000	Let me talk about
2262000	2264000	its history.
2264000	2266000	When it was first
2266000	2268000	proposed by
2268000	2270000	the team at
2270000	2272000	Berkeley,
2272000	2274000	they used
2274000	2276000	cadmium sulfide,
2276000	2278000	or CDS nanowire.
2278000	2280000	The length of the nanowire
2280000	2282000	is several microns
2282000	2284000	along the
2284000	2286000	growth direction
2286000	2288000	of the nanowire.
2288000	2290000	However,
2290000	2292000	its cross-section
2292000	2294000	is more than
2294000	2296000	one micrometer.
2296000	2298000	When it was first
2298000	2300000	developed,
2300000	2302000	we were excited
2302000	2304000	because we could
2304000	2306000	effectively limit
2306000	2308000	the energy
2308000	2310000	in at least
2310000	2312000	two dimensions.
2312000	2314000	However,
2314000	2316000	although the nanowire
2316000	2318000	effectively limits
2318000	2320000	the energy
2320000	2322000	in at least
2322000	2324000	two dimensions,
2324000	2326000	its cross-section
2326000	2328000	is more than
2328000	2330000	one micrometer.
2330000	2332000	If I'm not wrong,
2332000	2334000	it's several micrometers.
2334000	2336000	However,
2336000	2338000	as a pioneer
2338000	2340000	of paper,
2340000	2342000	the result is
2342000	2344000	quite exciting.
2344000	2346000	At that time,
2346000	2348000	Tsinghua University
2348000	2350000	wanted to
2350000	2352000	further reduce the size
2352000	2354000	of the nanowire
2354000	2356000	in three dimensions
2356000	2358000	to the limit of
2358000	2360000	light and snow.
2360000	2362000	Therefore,
2362000	2364000	they adopted
2364000	2366000	a core-shell structure
2366000	2368000	called
2368000	2370000	InGaN-AtGaN.
2370000	2372000	The core-shell structure
2372000	2374000	is composed of
2374000	2376000	GaN,
2376000	2378000	and InGaN.
2378000	2380000	In this way,
2380000	2382000	they successfully
2382000	2384000	reduced the size
2384000	2386000	of the nanowire
2386000	2388000	in three dimensions
2388000	2390000	to the limit of
2390000	2392000	light and snow.
2392000	2394000	In 2012,
2394000	2396000	the first nanowire
2396000	2398000	in three dimensions
2398000	2400000	was reduced to the limit of
2400000	2402000	light and snow.
2402000	2404000	However,
2404000	2406000	Tsinghua University
2406000	2408000	could not effectively
2408000	2410000	increase the operating temperature
2410000	2412000	to room temperature.
2412000	2414000	After all,
2414000	2416000	it is a more applicable research.
2416000	2418000	In other words,
2418000	2420000	we still hope that
2420000	2422000	it can play a role
2422000	2424000	in future projects
2424000	2426000	or future technology applications.
2426000	2428000	Therefore,
2428000	2430000	if this type of component
2430000	2432000	cannot be effectively
2432000	2434000	reduced to the limit of
2434000	2436000	light and snow,
2436000	2438000	we still hope that
2438000	2440000	it can play a role
2440000	2442000	in future projects.
2442000	2444000	In 2014,
2444000	2446000	Tsinghua University
2446000	2448000	adopted
2448000	2450000	a core-shell structure
2450000	2452000	called InGaN-AtGaN.
2452000	2454000	The difference between
2454000	2456000	InGaN-AtGaN and
2456000	2458000	InGaN-AtGaN
2458000	2460000	is that
2460000	2462000	InGaN-AtGaN can reduce
2462000	2464000	the loss of laser.
2464000	2466000	Reducing the loss of laser
2466000	2468000	is equivalent to
2468000	2470000	decreasing the pre-value.
2470000	2472000	If the pre-value is reduced,
2472000	2474000	there is no need to
2474000	2476000	consider too many thermal accumulation problems.
2476000	2478000	In 2014,
2478000	2480000	we started to do
2480000	2482000	laser operation at room temperature.
2482000	2484000	My team,
2484000	2486000	which is the team of
2486000	2488000	Mr. Lu Ting-Chang,
2488000	2490000	started to do laser operation
2490000	2492000	at room temperature.
2494000	2496000	Excuse me,
2496000	2498000	I have a question.
2498000	2500000	My name is Zan Xiang-Yu.
2500000	2502000	I am a friend of Lanying.
2502000	2504000	I want to ask
2504000	2506000	since
2506000	2508000	you are using nanowire,
2508000	2510000	you said that
2510000	2512000	the length of nanowire
2512000	2514000	may be limited.
2514000	2516000	Has anyone done
2516000	2518000	nanodots?
2518000	2520000	In fact,
2520000	2522000	in 2009,
2522000	2524000	there was
2524000	2526000	a team
2526000	2528000	that used
2528000	2530000	nanogold
2530000	2532000	to
2532000	2534000	attach
2534000	2536000	a
2536000	2538000	thin silicon
2538000	2540000	with many holes
2540000	2542000	to the wire.
2542000	2544000	The thin silicon
2544000	2546000	with many holes
2546000	2548000	will absorb
2548000	2550000	the organic material.
2550000	2552000	The organic material
2552000	2554000	is the GAPE material.
2554000	2556000	The thin silicon with many holes
2556000	2558000	is the GAPE material.
2558000	2560000	The gold particle
2560000	2562000	is the surfactant.
2562000	2564000	It is the zero-dimension
2564000	2566000	surface plasmon.
2566000	2568000	The zero-dimension surface plasmon
2568000	2570000	is called localized surface plasmon.
2570000	2572000	So,
2572000	2574000	in 2009,
2574000	2576000	someone did
2576000	2578000	publish a study
2578000	2580000	on Nature.
2580000	2582000	However,
2582000	2584000	this study
2584000	2586000	never
2586000	2588000	stimulated
2588000	2590000	a single
2590000	2592000	particle.
2592000	2594000	As I mentioned,
2594000	2596000	it uses gold nanoparticle.
2596000	2598000	The nanoparticle
2598000	2600000	is about 10 nanometers.
2600000	2602000	However,
2602000	2604000	it never
2604000	2606000	stimulated
2606000	2608000	a single particle.
2608000	2610000	It never stimulated
2610000	2612000	a single particle.
2612000	2614000	So,
2614000	2616000	it never
2616000	2618000	stimulated a single particle.
2618000	2620000	So,
2620000	2622000	it never
2622000	2624000	stimulated
2624000	2626000	a single particle.
2626000	2628000	The optical gain of
2628000	2630000	organic materials is very low.
2630000	2632000	So,
2632000	2634000	someone did this kind of study.
2634000	2636000	However,
2636000	2638000	the results are not that solid.
2638000	2640000	However,
2640000	2642000	the results are not that solid.
2642000	2644000	The results are not that solid.
2644000	2646000	The results are not that solid.
2646000	2648000	The results are not that solid.
2648000	2650000	The recent development
2650000	2652000	shows
2652000	2654000	that
2654000	2656000	the nanoparticle
2656000	2658000	is smaller than
2658000	2660000	the size of
2660000	2662000	quantum dot.
2662000	2664000	In general,
2664000	2666000	the size of quantum dot
2666000	2668000	is about 10 nanometers.
2668000	2670000	is about 10 nanometers.
2670000	2672000	However,
2672000	2674000	the recent study
2674000	2676000	shows that
2676000	2678000	the nanoparticle
2678000	2680000	is smaller than
2680000	2682000	the size of
2682000	2684000	quantum dot.
2684000	2686000	So,
2686000	2688000	this is my understanding.
2688000	2690000	I may not have any updates recently,
2690000	2692000	so if I missed anything,
2692000	2694000	I can talk about it again.
2694000	2696000	Sorry,
2696000	2698000	can I continue the question?
2698000	2700000	No problem.
2700000	2702000	You just mentioned
2702000	2704000	localized surface plasma.
2704000	2706000	You just mentioned
2706000	2708000	nanoparticle.
2708000	2710000	As far as I know,
2710000	2712000	the research on nanoparticle
2712000	2714000	changes the shape of
2714000	2716000	the surface plasma per rhythm
2716000	2718000	frequency.
2718000	2720000	Does this actually
2720000	2722000	affect the design
2722000	2724000	of your software?
2724000	2726000	For example,
2726000	2728000	do you use nanocube,
2728000	2730000	nanosphere,
2730000	2732000	or other nanoparticles
2732000	2734000	to change the frequency of the laser?
2734000	2736000	Yes, it does.
2736000	2738000	The surface shape changes
2738000	2740000	depending on
2740000	2742000	the per-cell effect.
2742000	2744000	The per-cell effect
2744000	2746000	affects the
2746000	2748000	environment
2748000	2750000	around the
2750000	2752000	surface.
2752000	2754000	So,
2754000	2756000	the shape of the
2756000	2758000	per-cell effect
2758000	2760000	affects the

5494000	5496000	around the

5514000	5516000	Thank you for your
5516000	5518000	wonderful presentation.
5518000	5520000	I think it's very good.
5520000	5522000	Well,
5522000	5524000	the next part is
5524000	5526000	Q&A. Before you ask
5526000	5528000	questions, because some
5528000	5530000	friends have already
5530000	5532000	asked questions during
5532000	5534000	the conversation.
5534000	5536000	I will ask them first,
5536000	5538000	and others can
5538000	5540000	think about
5540000	5542000	the questions.
5542000	5544000	Thank you.
5572000	5574000	Got it. Thank you.
5574000	5576000	Okay.
5576000	5578000	Next question.
5578000	5580000	I think the next question is quite interesting.
5580000	5582000	Because I don't think it's a straightforward question.
5582000	5584000	Someone asked
5584000	5586000	He's a little confused.
5586000	5588000	He thinks your excitation
5588000	5590000	Your surface plasmon excitation
5590000	5592000	Is it from the incident photon?
5592000	5594000	Or is it from the light excitation from the nanowire?
5598000	5600000	Okay.
5600000	5602000	This part is a little...
5602000	5604000	Because there's a cavity, right?
5604000	5606000	So I'm not sure how to answer.
5606000	5608000	You tell me. Sorry.
5608000	5610000	Let me get into the more detailed part.
5612000	5614000	First of all,
5614000	5616000	How does this process occur?
5616000	5618000	Let's start with a light.
5620000	5622000	I don't know why the animation is stuck.
5626000	5628000	Then I'll just use this.
5628000	5630000	And then we come to the light.
5630000	5632000	This light is in the nanowire.
5632000	5634000	It's going to trigger the excitation.
5634000	5636000	And the excitation
5636000	5638000	Because he's in
5638000	5640000	When it's a lot of power.
5640000	5642000	His dispersion is still very
5642000	5644000	The situation is very fluid.
5644000	5646000	So he can effectively take his energy.
5646000	5648000	Coupled to the surface plasmon mode.
5648000	5650000	Okay, this is actually quite important.
5650000	5652000	I didn't mention anything special just now.
5652000	5654000	You can see this picture.
5654000	5656000	We'll find that the surface plasmon
5656000	5658000	Dark mode.
5658000	5660000	What does dark mode mean?
5660000	5662000	You can't effectively see the light.
5662000	5664000	He can only be invisible.
5664000	5666000	On the surface.
5666000	5668000	Because he's under the light line.
5668000	5670000	All the dispersion is under the light line.
5670000	5672000	You can't use the optical mode.
5672000	5674000	The way to see him.
5674000	5676000	So,
5676000	5678000	This is how we trigger the process.
5678000	5680000	Through light first
5680000	5682000	Exciton in the nanowire.
5682000	5684000	Exciton in the nanowire.
5684000	5686000	And the exciton dispersion.
5686000	5688000	In a very large range of motion.
5688000	5690000	It's all very flat.
5690000	5692000	And he can happen to be with
5692000	5694000	Surface plasmon mode.
5694000	5696000	When he couples,
5696000	5698000	He's going to produce a polariton.
5698000	5700000	And this polariton.
5700000	5702000	He's going to become.
5702000	5704000	Okay, when he produces a polariton.
5704000	5706000	After that, it's us.
5706000	5708000	Hey.
5708000	5710000	That is.
5712000	5714000	Uh, wait a minute.
5720000	5722000	The animation can suddenly be used.
5722000	5724000	Then I'll just say it.
5724000	5726000	First of all, use the light to trigger that.
5726000	5728000	Semiconductor nanowire.
5728000	5730000	And then the exciton in the semiconductor nanowire.
5730000	5732000	After it comes out, it will give the energy.
5732000	5734000	Couple to surface plasmon mode.
5734000	5736000	Polariton.
5736000	5738000	That's what we see here.
5738000	5740000	This thing that's fair.
5740000	5742000	And then how did he release the energy?
5742000	5744000	It's through the interface.
5744000	5746000	The discontinuity that causes the dispersion.
5746000	5748000	I'm going to disperse this dark mode.
5748000	5750000	So if you're going to go a little bit further.
5750000	5752000	How about this kind of laser efficiency?
5752000	5754000	To be honest, it's actually pretty bad.
5754000	5756000	The first one is his mirror.
5756000	5758000	It's based on.
5758000	5760000	The interface formed by the change in the refractive index.
5760000	5762000	His reflection rate is about.
5762000	5764000	Only about 20 to 40 percent.
5764000	5766000	The limit is about 40.
5766000	5768000	In fact, we're going to go through the software.
5768000	5770000	It's about 20 percent.
5770000	5772000	The other one is.
5772000	5774000	He's going to go out of the way.
5774000	5776000	He's going to go through the interface.
5776000	5778000	Continuous dispersion.
5778000	5780000	It's not enough.
5780000	5782000	The part that's not enough.
5782000	5784000	To be able to couple to light mode.
5784000	5786000	Otherwise, it's the same.
5786000	5788000	Dark mode.
5788000	5790000	So this is the part that I'm not going to talk about.
5790000	5792000	In order to overcome this issue in the future.
5792000	5794000	We have to be at his.
5794000	5796000	The two ends of the point.
5796000	5798000	To design.
5798000	5800000	Or design.
5800000	5802000	Such a structure.
5802000	5804000	To be able to put these dark mode.
5804000	5806000	Energy in the highest efficiency way.
5806000	5808000	Come out.
5808000	5810000	What about the current stage of research?
5810000	5812000	Almost no.
5812000	5814000	He's on the edge of the place.
5814000	5816000	To do any.
5816000	5818000	Reflective structure.
5818000	5820000	It's not about the edge.
5820000	5822000	To do any.
5822000	5824000	The structure design.
5824000	5826000	So the raw material.
5826000	5828000	His energy conversion efficiency.
5828000	5830000	It's actually very bad.
5830000	5832000	And his orientation.
5832000	5834000	It's not as good as our traditional laser.
5834000	5836000	So good.
5836000	5838000	Because it's through the dispersion.
5838000	5840000	To make up for the insufficient momentum.
5840000	5842000	Let him be able to.
5842000	5844000	Couple to light mode.
5844000	5846000	Let him be able to.
5846000	5848000	Couple to light mode.
5848000	5850000	This is what I want to say.
5850000	5852000	This is what I want to say.
5852000	5854000	I didn't particularly talk about these details.
5854000	5856000	Because I want to say that everyone's.
5856000	5858000	The background is south and north.
5858000	5860000	If you have a more detailed part.
5860000	5862000	If you want to ask.
5862000	5864000	You are welcome to ask.
5864000	5866000	Okay.
5866000	5868000	Actually, I still have a problem.
5868000	5870000	But I think we are today.
5870000	5872000	It's a bit long.
5872000	5874000	I've been talking for too long.
5874000	5876000	I didn't eat anything.
5876000	5878000	I didn't pay much attention.
5878000	5880000	Most people are here.
5880000	5882000	So it's very exciting.
5882000	5884000	Please open the microphone again.
5884000	5886000	Let's give it up again.
5886000	5888000	Thank you for the wonderful speech.
5888000	5890000	Thank you for the wonderful speech.
5890000	5892000	Thank you for the wonderful speech.
5892000	5894000	I'm going to put this here.
5894000	5896000	The event is over here.
5896000	5898000	But I'm just.
