0	13000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Tara Talk on May 9th. I am today's host, Hong Shi-an.
13000	18000	We are honored to invite Xu Ruifu to speak for us today.
18000	26000	Xu Ruifu is currently a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
26000	35000	He will be entering the PhD program at NTU in September.
35000	43000	His main research is on micro-fine-graining and material studies.
43000	53000	Today's topic is the Ultimate Challenge of Antenna Miniaturization.
53000	59000	Before we start, let's give the speaker a round of applause.
59000	64000	Before we start, please remember to turn on your microphones.
64000	74000	Let's give the floor to Ruifu.
74000	78000	Thank you for the introduction.
78000	82000	If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
82000	94000	I graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2016.
94000	99000	I studied for a year and graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering.
99000	104000	I used to work as a research assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
104000	108000	I was originally planning to go to UCLA, but decided to stay in Taiwan.
108000	117000	Part of the reason is that I am now organizing a group of people to discuss Taiwan's PhD policy.
117000	122000	Last year, I was elected to be the president of NTU.
122000	128000	Prior to that, I was also a consultant at the Executive Yuan.
128000	133000	I have been concerned about the current situation.
133000	139000	In the past 10 years, the number of PhD students in Taiwan has dropped from 20,000 to 15,000.
139000	141000	This is a three-fold decrease.
141000	153000	At this point in time, people will be thinking about whether there is a need to adjust the way we nurture PhD students.
153000	160000	Whether there is a need to gather more resources to nurture our young researchers.
160000	166000	In addition to doing academic research, I am also concerned about this public policy.
166000	177000	I will spend a lot of time introducing the basic knowledge of the frontline and why we need to study this topic.
177000	182000	Later, I will talk about some of the results of my previous research.
182000	188000	Perhaps most people are familiar with and have an impression of the frontline.
188000	191000	It is an electromagnetic textbook.
191000	197000	If there is an electron with an acceleration, it will produce electromagnetic radiation.
197000	200000	That is the basic definition of physics.
200000	213000	If the frontline is a circuit, it is more like a transition device.
213000	215000	What kind of transition is it?
215000	220000	It is a guided wave and a free space wave.
220000	233000	A guided wave is a wave that travels from the transmission line to the air.
233000	240000	There is a device in the middle that can transform the electromagnetic wave.
240000	250000	In the transition region, we can design structures or materials to achieve the desired effect.
250000	255000	If we look at this in a circuit-based way,
255000	266000	for example, in this picture, we have a voltage source with its own generator resistance.
266000	273000	It is transmitted through the transmission line to the antenna.
273000	276000	The RL stands for Loss.
276000	279000	It may be the loss of various sources.
279000	282000	For example, conductive loss.
282000	289000	The R stands for the place where the radiation is emitted.
290000	293000	For the whole system,
293000	296000	whether it is heat loss or radiation loss,
296000	302000	it is the dissipation of energy in the circuit.
302000	304000	It can be represented by this resistor.
304000	308000	It also has some conductive or electromagnetic properties.
308000	312000	If we express an antenna in a circuit, it is like this.
312000	318000	In our impression, there are various kinds of antennas in life.
318000	321000	For example, this is what we think of the most.
321000	322000	It is called an O-level antenna.
322000	325000	It can be seen in Wi-Fi AP.
325000	330000	It is rarely seen in Doraemon comics or our roof.
330000	332000	But sometimes we see this kind of antenna.
332000	335000	It is called Yagyuda.
335000	338000	It is called octagonal antenna.
338000	343000	There is also this kind called helical antenna.
344000	349000	It is characterized by high concentration and is cylindrical.
349000	351000	There is also this kind of horn antenna.
351000	356000	Or the simplest and most common is called patch antenna.
356000	361000	It has a ground and a metal plate.
361000	364000	Many people may have the impression of an antenna.
364000	366000	In addition to this, it is a long-standing mobile phone.
366000	371000	You can see that it is connected to a very simple O-level antenna.
371000	377000	Many people may wonder why our mobile phones do not have this.
377000	386000	In fact, the antenna of our mobile phones is usually integrated into its chip and its shape.
386000	390000	For example, there is a famous story.
390000	394000	It is the iPhone 4 antenna door incident.
394000	400000	When the user holds this place, it is called the death grip.
400000	403000	As long as you hold it, you will die.
403000	405000	This is a very famous incident.
405000	412000	It is because it integrates its metal frame with its received frequency.
412000	421000	Unfortunately, when it was designed, it did not consider that the user's hand would lead to the short circuit of the receiver.
421000	427000	In fact, the design of the antenna can be extended from an ancient physical problem
427000	436000	to the modern user experience, aesthetics, and system performance.
436000	443000	Next, I will talk about some of the most common design parameters of antennas.
443000	446000	The first one is called radiation pattern.
446000	454000	Radiation pattern is a mathematical expression expressed in an image.
454000	459000	Usually, it is used to express some of the characteristics of radiation,
459000	464000	such as the intensity of its power, the intensity of its magnetic field,
464000	469000	or its fragrance, or all kinds of characteristics.
469000	474000	Usually, when we look at the radiation pattern,
474000	479000	we call it the far-field region.
479000	483000	There are two main reasons for the far-field region.
483000	491000	One is that the radiation pattern is no longer related to its distance.
491000	494000	It can be a more independent reference parameter.
494000	497000	The other is that it will become a flat wave form.
497000	502000	So there are many characteristics of radiation,
502000	506000	whether it is your power flux or your field strength.
506000	508000	They are all described in this way.
508000	514000	For example, this image shows the radiation pattern of an antenna in the form of a spherical coordinate.
514000	523000	We can express it as its power or its field strength.
523000	525000	This is called the major lobe.
525000	531000	This is where the magnetic field is strongest.
531000	535000	One of the important parameters of antenna design
535000	543000	is how to design its radiation characteristics into the shape and shape you want.
543000	548000	The second important parameter is called directivity and gain.
548000	557000	Directivity is the intensity of the radiation of the antenna in a specific direction
557000	562000	and the average value of the antenna in all directions.
562000	571000	So it can be used to show how concentrated the intensity is in that place.
571000	575000	The difference between gain and directivity is that
575000	581000	it looks at how the antenna effectively converts the radiation it receives
582000	588000	into the intensity it can actually receive in another place.
588000	594000	So the relationship between the two is that there is a difference in radiation efficiency.
600000	606000	Radiation efficiency is usually the ratio of the power received by the antenna structure
606000	610000	to the actual radiation output.
610000	612000	It is between 0 and 1.
612000	616000	This radiation efficiency is something we care about.
616000	619000	For example, in the design of a mobile phone,
619000	625000	the radiation efficiency directly affects the performance of the battery.
625000	630000	Or some more important applications affect the power consumption.
633000	638000	Another parameter is more practical, called realized gain.
638000	643000	If we look at this circuit diagram,
643000	648000	when the transmission goes to the antenna end,
648000	651000	there is a problem with the resistance matching.
651000	655000	In other words, if the resistance cannot be matched,
655000	659000	some of the waves of energy will be reflected back.
659000	662000	In this case, it will be less efficient.
662000	668000	Realized gain is the ratio of the power received by the antenna
668000	673000	to the gamma-reflected value of the gain.
673000	679000	This is the most practical aspect of the performance of the antenna.
680000	682000	I have a question.
682000	684000	Hello, I'm sorry.
684000	686000	I have a very basic question.
686000	688000	I really don't know much about this.
688000	690000	For an antenna,
690000	695000	we know that it usually has amplitude modulation and phase modulation.
695000	698000	In your design,
698000	701000	or the parameters you are talking about now,
701000	708000	is there a difference between amplitude and phase modulation in AM?
708000	713000	Or do you just need to get the maximum signal?
713000	718000	If it is an antenna,
718000	723000	our main consideration is how to get the maximum signal.
723000	726000	At the end,
726000	731000	we can use circuit design or some mathematical theory to make some modifications.
731000	733000	In fact, the strength of the signal,
733000	735000	which I will talk about later,
735000	739000	the ultimate goal behind the strength of the signal is
739000	744000	how to make the data transmission rate of your communication system
744000	746000	higher and better.
746000	749000	The higher the data transmission rate,
749000	751000	in fact, it will have many aspects.
751000	753000	The strength of the signal is one.
753000	756000	But, for example, the AMFM I just mentioned
756000	758000	is actually a different modulation method.
758000	762000	It will also affect the transmission rate.
762000	766000	There are many different places that affect the transmission rate.
766000	772000	But our ultimate goal is to improve the transmission rate of the entire communication system.
772000	774000	The design of the antenna,
774000	777000	the main consideration is the strength of the signal.
777000	783000	Thank you.
783000	789000	Bandwidth is also an important indicator.
789000	792000	As I will talk about later,
792000	797000	there is a well-known basic communication company called Channel Capacity.
797000	802000	There is a well-known information theorist called Shannon.
802000	806000	In addition to the strength of the signal,
806000	811000	another thing that affects the transmission rate is bandwidth.
811000	817000	But bandwidth is actually a broader thing.
817000	820000	Bandwidth just means that
820000	823000	the characteristics of our antenna
823000	828000	can maintain the characteristics we want within a certain frequency range.
828000	831000	So it can indicate a lot of physical variables,
831000	833000	such as input resistance,
833000	839000	for example, the beamwidth of the radiation pattern I just mentioned,
839000	841000	or the polarization you want.
841000	845000	It can have a lot of physical variables.
845000	850000	But what we see most often is the bandwidth of resistance.
850000	854000	The reason why the antenna produces radiation
854000	859000	is because it produces resonance of the structure at a certain frequency.
859000	862000	When resonance occurs,
862000	869000	the resistance and the reactance will change drastically.
869000	875000	As long as you can match the impedance,
875000	881000	the energy will be absorbed.
881000	885000	So if we want to achieve a broad bandwidth,
885000	888000	where the impedance is bandwidth,
888000	890000	we often see a parameter,
890000	893000	which is the reflection factor I mentioned earlier.
893000	896000	How to make this bandwidth as wide as possible
896000	900000	will affect the transmission rate of the entire system.
902000	906000	After talking about some basic features of the antenna,
906000	910000	I will slowly move on to the part about antenna miniaturization.
911000	916000	Antenna miniaturization is a very old topic.
916000	921000	It was discussed at the beginning of World War II.
921000	926000	At the beginning, there was a person who had a lot to do with us.
926000	929000	He was a professor at MIT named Zhu Lancheng.
929000	932000	In fact, in the early years,
932000	936000	he also helped a lot with the teaching and teaching in Taiwan.
936000	938000	He was a professor at MIT.
938000	942000	In 1948, he proposed this concept for the first time.
942000	943000	What is it?
943000	948000	He said that the design of the antenna was a bit like a blind man's vision.
948000	953000	He felt that a certain design could achieve a target.
953000	956000	For example, what kind of radiation efficiency do I want?
956000	957000	What kind of gain do I want?
957000	959000	What kind of bandwidth do I want?
959000	963000	However, we often modify the east and the west.
963000	965000	Change a little bit here and there.
965000	970000	We want to see how we can get the best design target.
970000	974000	But there seems to be some kind of connection between them.
974000	977000	It seems that you can't change everything at the same time.
977000	979000	There will always be some kind of trade-off.
979000	989000	Professor Zhu Lancheng proposed the concept of how to describe the relationship between them for the first time in 1948.
989000	992000	His idea was not very complicated.
992000	999000	He used a sphere to wrap up the antenna structure.
999000	1003000	He used a sphere that could enclose the entire antenna structure.
1003000	1011000	He assumed that there are ideal characteristics in the sphere.
1011000	1014000	For example, there is no loss in it, and there is no storage of energy.
1014000	1018000	Assume that there is a vibrating mode in it.
1018000	1020000	It may be the simplest mode.
1020000	1023000	The vibrating mode is a general expression.
1023000	1025000	After assuming the vibration mode,
1025000	1030000	calculate the vibrating mode of the spherical wave.
1030000	1036000	The second step is to convert the vibrating mode of the spherical wave into an equivalent circuit.
1036000	1041000	Each Z represents a vibration mode in it.
1041000	1044000	Through the calculation of the equivalent circuit,
1044000	1068000	we can calculate how much energy is stored and how much energy is dissipated by the electromagnetic wave.
1068000	1070000	This is the quality factor.
1070000	1073000	I'd like to talk a little bit about the quality factor.
1073000	1076000	The concept of the quality factor that we first came across
1076000	1079000	was probably in the system of spring-force oscillation.
1079000	1083000	At that time, we were looking for the lower the loss, the better.
1083000	1086000	The higher the Q value, the better.
1086000	1089000	It means that the energy is not wasted,
1089000	1092000	and it is a high-efficiency oscillation.
1092000	1095000	But the opposite is true for the antenna.
1095000	1099000	We are not looking for the higher the Q value, the better.
1099000	1102000	Because for the circuit system,
1102000	1110000	Q also represents the energy that is lost and the energy that is radiated.
1110000	1112000	For the circuit system,
1112000	1116000	the energy that is lost and the energy that is radiated are both a kind of loss.
1116000	1119000	So if you want to have a wider frequency band,
1119000	1122000	the lower the Q value, the better.
1122000	1125000	But this involves another problem.
1125000	1128000	In the end, the lower the Q value, the better.
1128000	1131000	Is it that your energy is all used up in the circuit?
1131000	1133000	Or is it radiation?
1133000	1135000	This is another problem.
1135000	1137000	So it's possible that your...
1137000	1139000	My question is,
1139000	1142000	but if what we're doing today is all commercial circuits,
1142000	1144000	all communications,
1144000	1147000	you can't just choose a narrowband,
1147000	1149000	a transmission band,
1149000	1153000	and then you just need to make a very large Q,
1154000	1156000	the noise bandwidth will be very small.
1156000	1158000	So for the receiver,
1158000	1161000	you can still use a very large Q antenna.
1161000	1164000	You're right.
1164000	1169000	But usually we still expect the wider the frequency band, the better.
1169000	1173000	But in this case,
1173000	1179000	it depends on what your needs are in the design scenario,
1179000	1181000	and how you want to solve this problem.
1181000	1186000	But if we only evaluate the performance of the antenna itself,
1186000	1188000	whether it's gain or bandwidth,
1188000	1190000	or radiation efficiency,
1190000	1193000	we expect it to be the larger the better.
1193000	1195000	But in reality,
1195000	1198000	if you really can't reach that bandwidth,
1198000	1201000	there are other techniques that you can use to overcome it.
1201000	1207000	For example, is it possible that the resonance frequency band can be switched?
1207000	1212000	Then you can save some design space.
1212000	1217000	If it's really narrowband.
1217000	1220000	So as I said, the lower the Q value, the better.
1220000	1222000	But there's another problem.
1222000	1227000	Is your Q value low because the energy is used in the circuit or radiation?
1227000	1229000	If it's all used in the circuit,
1229000	1233000	that means the radiation efficiency is very, very low.
1233000	1236000	By doing this calculation,
1236000	1238000	we get a general expression.
1238000	1241000	This expression doesn't look like this at first,
1241000	1245000	but the people in the back keep improving and modifying it.
1245000	1250000	This is roughly the limit that everyone accepts in the current antenna design field.
1250000	1255000	From this relationship, we can see that K is the wave number.
1255000	1259000	It's 2pi over lambda.
1259000	1264000	So here, A is the enclosing sphere.
1264000	1267000	So it's equal to the ratio of A to lambda.
1267000	1270000	So if your antenna is getting smaller and smaller,
1270000	1274000	for example, far smaller than the wave length,
1274000	1276000	it's actually this three-dimensional direction that will dominate.
1276000	1280000	Then it will become very large very quickly.
1280000	1282000	So that means your Q is lower bound.
1282000	1284000	Its Q is considered lower bound,
1284000	1286000	so your lower bound will keep getting higher.
1286000	1291000	In other words, the frequency of your system will definitely be downgraded.
1291000	1297000	In 1948, this article was the first to discuss this issue.
1297000	1300000	No matter how much you modify it,
1300000	1304000	in fact, your antenna performance will have a theoretical limit.
1304000	1310000	This problem becomes a bit like the Holy Grail in the antenna design field.
1310000	1315000	It's an issue that everyone wants to discuss and pursue.
1315000	1323000	The formula that I just mentioned is also the channel capacity proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948.
1323000	1334000	It says that the amount and rate of data that can be transmitted by communication
1334000	1340000	is related to our frequency and signal-to-noise ratio.
1341000	1346000	In other words, if we want to improve our data transmission rate,
1346000	1349000	either our frequency can be improved,
1349000	1354000	or our signal-to-noise ratio can be improved.
1354000	1361000	There is a very interesting experiment.
1361000	1368000	In theory, this limit cannot be proven.
1368000	1372000	If you really want to prove it, you can only prove that
1372000	1376000	I propose a design, and I break your boundary,
1376000	1378000	so your theory has a problem.
1378000	1383000	So in 2012, these people gathered their strength.
1383000	1390000	They searched for more than 100 articles in IEEE APS's 7,800 articles
1390000	1395000	to analyze its performance to see if it is within this theoretical bound.
1396000	1399000	Here are some of their calculations.
1399000	1405000	So they got the picture I put in the speech projection video.
1405000	1413000	The difference between virtual and real is only the mode used.
1413000	1416000	In this picture, the horizontal axis is KA,
1416000	1421000	which is the ratio of the physical size relative to the wavelength.
1422000	1425000	So from this picture,
1425000	1429000	it explains why this Friedman's limit is exceeded.
1429000	1432000	In fact, it is not exceeded.
1432000	1435000	It is related to its impedance matching.
1435000	1439000	Its impedance matching has been modified.
1439000	1441000	If impedance matching is also considered,
1441000	1444000	it does not exceed the theoretical limit.
1444000	1448000	So according to his paper,
1448000	1451000	this theoretical limit seems to be correct.
1451000	1453000	This is one thing.
1453000	1458000	Another thing is that its KA is only 0.1.
1458000	1465000	For example, if the antenna is at 3GHz resonance,
1465000	1470000	3GHz is about 10 cm.
1470000	1475000	Yes, 10 cm.
1475000	1479000	In this case, 0.1 is about 1 cm.
1479000	1483000	So this is the feeling of 0.1 wavelength.
1483000	1488000	Another thing is that when KA is very, very small,
1488000	1491000	many studies have pointed out that
1491000	1494000	all existing historical designs
1494000	1497000	are well below this theoretical bound.
1498000	1502000	Even if the theoretical limit tells us
1502000	1505000	that the performance of the antenna will definitely deteriorate,
1505000	1510000	we will still design well below the theoretical limit.
1510000	1512000	What is the theoretical limit?
1512000	1514000	B long.
1514000	1516000	B is bandwidth.
1516000	1519000	Long is the radiation efficiency of the antenna.
1519000	1523000	So the radiation efficiency will directly affect
1523000	1526000	our signal-to-noise ratio.
1526000	1529000	So it directly affects our transmission rate.
1529000	1531000	These two things must be considered together.
1531000	1534000	Because in the previous theoretical limit,
1534000	1536000	it only considered the quality factor.
1536000	1538000	It is related to bandwidth.
1538000	1542000	But often the radiation efficiency and bandwidth
1542000	1545000	will have a trade-off.
1545000	1548000	There have been new theoretical discussions.
1548000	1551000	For example, in this article in 2017,
1551000	1553000	he discussed that
1553000	1556000	in fact,
1556000	1558000	in this formula,
1558000	1562000	when the signal-to-noise ratio is less than 1,
1562000	1564000	it will be converted into this formula.
1564000	1566000	At this time,
1566000	1570000	the main dominant channel capacity
1570000	1572000	is the intensity of the signal.
1572000	1575000	The intensity of the signal will be directly related to the radiation efficiency.
1575000	1580000	So he did not use the structure of Ka to the quality factor
1580000	1582000	to deduce,
1582000	1585000	but to deduce directly from the radiation efficiency.
1585000	1587000	He also deduced a theoretical bound.
1587000	1590000	In 2017, this theory is still being renewed.
1590000	1592000	To refine.
1592000	1596000	So when we know such a limit and background,
1596000	1598000	we will think about
1598000	1602000	where we have the need for this application.
1603000	1606000	This picture is a peninsula.
1606000	1608000	I have not been there.
1608000	1610000	I just downloaded it from the Internet.
1610000	1614000	It is a VLF antenna of the U.S. Navy.
1614000	1616000	How big is this peninsula?
1616000	1619000	At kilometer square.
1619000	1622000	It is about 100 football fields.
1622000	1626000	Its energy consumption is 8 MW.
1626000	1629000	It is about a hydropower dam.
1629000	1631000	Each antenna is 300 meters.
1631000	1633000	It is about the Eiffel Tower.
1633000	1636000	What is the antenna doing?
1636000	1640000	It is related to submarine communication.
1640000	1642000	It is to do submarine communication.
1642000	1645000	Why is it so big and so powerful?
1645000	1647000	Because of the wavelength.
1647000	1650000	It is a frequency of 3 to 30 kHz.
1650000	1653000	It can do underwater and underground communication.
1653000	1654000	Because at this frequency,
1654000	1657000	it can penetrate water or oil.
1657000	1659000	It can also reflect in the elevator.
1659000	1663000	But this frequency is very long.
1663000	1665000	10 to 100 kilometers.
1665000	1667000	So if you want to operate efficiently
1667000	1670000	in a wavelength or half a wavelength,
1670000	1674000	it is inevitable that it is a huge monster.
1674000	1677000	So your cost will be very high.
1677000	1679000	Another one is
1679000	1681000	if you want to be more practical,
1681000	1684000	become a portable device.
1684000	1686000	For example, when you are diving,
1686000	1687000	you also want to communicate.
1687000	1689000	For example, when you are caving,
1689000	1691000	you also want to communicate.
1691000	1693000	It is inevitable that if you wear it,
1693000	1696000	there will be a problem of battery life
1696000	1698000	and physical size.
1698000	1699000	At this time,
1699000	1701000	your traditional antenna structure
1701000	1704000	will become very inefficient
1704000	1705000	and unusable.
1705000	1709000	Because for this wavelength,
1709000	1713000	our place is electrically small.
1713000	1715000	It is here.
1715000	1720000	It is well below theoretical bound.
1720000	1724000	In addition to low-frequency applications,
1724000	1725000	we are also looking forward to
1725000	1728000	some applications with higher frequencies.
1728000	1729000	For example,
1729000	1732000	our Apple Watch is a portable device.
1732000	1734000	Although it is not so huge,
1734000	1736000	if we want to put the antenna
1736000	1737000	in a very small place,
1737000	1739000	it will also be electrically small.
1739000	1741000	Or we may want to design
1742000	1745000	a medical device.
1745000	1748000	After it reaches the human body,
1748000	1750000	it will not only be electrically small,
1750000	1754000	but its signal will also be very, very weak.
1754000	1756000	In addition,
1756000	1758000	some people are thinking about wearable devices,
1758000	1761000	such as clothes or contact lenses.
1761000	1764000	These may also have higher frequencies,
1764000	1769000	but also require an electrically small scene.
1769000	1771000	How to solve this problem?
1771000	1773000	In fact,
1773000	1776000	humans have used a similar concept before,
1776000	1778000	but it did not happen in the antenna.
1778000	1780000	It happened in other places.
1780000	1782000	If you look at the picture on the right,
1782000	1787000	this is the circuit board of our ancient age.
1787000	1790000	There is also this kind of electrode and capacitor on it.
1790000	1793000	This chip is very early.
1793000	1796000	It is called the surface wave filter.
1797000	1798000	So later,
1798000	1800000	we can make the circuit very small,
1800000	1803000	and no longer use these,
1803000	1806000	what is it called?
1806000	1808000	Distributor or something.
1808000	1812000	This kind of characteristic electrode and capacitor
1812000	1815000	can be integrated into the chip and become smaller
1815000	1818000	because of this surface wave filter.
1818000	1820000	What is its basic concept?
1820000	1822000	It is what we learned in high school.
1822000	1825000	The frequency is equal to the frequency times the wavelength.
1825000	1827000	Then our acoustic wave
1827000	1832000	is about 1,000 to 10,000 meters per second.
1832000	1834000	But our speed of light is 3 times 4,
1834000	1836000	which is 8 square meters per second.
1836000	1840000	So if we want to use the same operating frequency,
1840000	1845000	the wave speed will be proportional to the wavelength.
1845000	1846000	So intrinsically,
1846000	1850000	if you use a mechanical wave as a resonance,
1850000	1855000	its physical size will be about 10 to the 5th order.
1855000	1859000	In the deep wave filter and later,
1859000	1862000	in fact, our mobile phones are already in use.
1862000	1866000	It is called duplexer, diplexer, or filter.
1866000	1870000	They are all used to operate frequency components or oscillators.
1870000	1872000	These things have long been used
1872000	1875000	in the deep wave components of mechanics,
1875000	1877000	which is the surface wave filter.
1877000	1879000	There is also a newer technology
1879000	1885000	called the Fog Acoustic Wave.
1885000	1889000	So is it possible to realize this in the antenna?
1889000	1890000	Everyone is thinking about
1890000	1892000	whether it is possible to apply a similar concept
1892000	1895000	to make it smaller.
1895000	1897000	It can really shrink it,
1897000	1898000	or although it is smaller,
1898000	1901000	its performance is acceptable.
1901000	1903000	So everyone has been discussing a new concept
1903000	1905000	for about a year or two.
1905000	1907000	In fact, it is not possible,
1907000	1909000	but I started to think about it again.
1909000	1912000	I proposed a term called Mechanical Antenna.
1912000	1914000	It is relatively electrical,
1914000	1916000	called mechanical.
1916000	1919000	In this article in 2019,
1919000	1922000	they should also be part of the DAPA team.
1922000	1925000	They were discussing
1925000	1927000	what kind of research there is now
1927000	1930000	and what is the difference between it and traditional antenna.
1930000	1932000	This is how he described it.
1933000	1935000	I want to clarify one thing.
1935000	1940000	Because ZOO, or ZOO Theory,
1940000	1942000	is basically a circuit.
1942000	1943000	But in fact,
1943000	1945000	you can replace all the components on the circuit
1945000	1948000	with equivalent mechanical components.
1948000	1950000	So in theory,
1950000	1953000	the equation is still correct.
1953000	1956000	It's just that now you have changed Lambda to be very small,
1956000	1959000	so K becomes very large.
1959000	1960000	Sorry, Lambda is very large,
1960000	1961000	so K becomes very small.
1961000	1964000	But that one square plus three squares,
1964000	1968000	that relation should still be Holtz, right?
1968000	1971000	Theoretically, it is like this,
1971000	1974000	but there is not a very strict,
1974000	1976000	complete argument.
1976000	1980000	That's what we think.
1980000	1983000	This will be discussed later.
1983000	1985000	Then this Mechanical Antenna,
1985000	1987000	he described it like this.
1987000	1989000	He said, for example,
1989000	1992000	if we think about the source of the electromagnetic wave,
1992000	1994000	it can be a moving electron,
1994000	1996000	which becomes a current.
1996000	1999000	Does that moving become a physical motion,
1999000	2001000	rather than a current?
2001000	2002000	So he said,
2002000	2004000	you can take a desystatic field source,
2004000	2007000	like a magnet or charge distribution,
2007000	2009000	then mechanically move it
2009000	2013000	to modulate its external field.
2013000	2015000	So for an observer,
2015000	2018000	the electromagnetic wave he received,
2018000	2019000	for them,
2019000	2023000	it is no different from the equivalent electrical induced dipole.
2023000	2025000	It can do this.
2025000	2029000	Then he discussed some different designs in it.
2029000	2031000	For example, on the left,
2031000	2035000	in some ferroelectric or ferromagnetic materials,
2035000	2037000	there will be a lot of dipole moments.
2037000	2041000	Then you apply some stress to it,
2041000	2042000	alternating stress.
2042000	2047000	The dipole moment may change direction
2047000	2049000	and produce an electromagnetic wave.
2049000	2051000	Or more violently,
2051000	2054000	you spin the whole ferromagnetic iron
2054000	2057000	to produce an electromagnetic wave radiation.
2057000	2061000	You can check this paper if you are interested.
2061000	2064000	But I think many of his discussions are still very primitive.
2064000	2067000	In fact, I don't fully believe it.
2068000	2073000	Then he summarized the current mechanical antenna,
2073000	2077000	operating band, and some references.
2077000	2081000	My focus now is on this area,
2081000	2084000	from very high frequency to ultra high frequency.
2084000	2089000	Then I use these ferro materials
2089000	2092000	as the source of radiation.
2092000	2094000	I am more focused on this area
2094000	2096000	because the data rate of this frequency is higher,
2096000	2098000	so there may be commercial applications.
2098000	2101000	But in fact, if it is low frequency,
2101000	2103000	it is a military application.
2103000	2107000	But I haven't found a partner yet,
2107000	2109000	so I may be interested in developing it.
2109000	2112000	I know they are already doing it in the US.
2114000	2118000	The other article is also published this year.
2118000	2120000	Not mine.
2120000	2122000	He is also discussing
2122000	2127000	the structure of different new mechanical antennas.
2127000	2130000	For example, there is a model of general antenna.
2130000	2132000	When it is electrically small,
2132000	2134000	in order to make it match,
2134000	2136000	it will become very lossy.
2136000	2137000	There is a problem with it.
2137000	2139000	Then your radiation efficiency will become poor.
2139000	2141000	It is also difficult to match.
2141000	2143000	Then this mechanical antenna
2143000	2146000	can also draw some equivalent circuits
2146000	2148000	to calculate its radiation.
2148000	2150000	In this article,
2150000	2152000	the main comparison is
2152000	2154000	electrolyte,
2154000	2160000	that is, electric charge,
2160000	2165000	or Pielo electric material.
2165000	2168000	In the end, Klein said
2168000	2172000	that in the structure of Pielo electric alternating dipole,
2172000	2174000	we can expect that
2174000	2177000	it is smaller than the traditional dipole antenna.
2177000	2179000	When it is small,
2179000	2181000	its relative efficiency
2181000	2184000	can be up to 10 to 6 times.
2184000	2188000	This is already published in the article of Applied Physics.
2188000	2191000	If we use the characteristics of the electric charge,
2191000	2195000	its radiation efficiency can be up to 10 to 6 times.
2195000	2198000	However, don't think 10 to 6 times is very powerful.
2198000	2200000	Because it may only be a completely useless thing
2200000	2202000	to be slightly usable.
2202000	2204000	Because there is the theoretical bound.
2204000	2206000	Sorry, I keep interrupting.
2206000	2208000	I have a question.
2208000	2209000	This is a small question.
2209000	2211000	The surface acoustic wave,
2211000	2213000	or mechanical wave in general,
2213000	2215000	is its lossiness related to temperature?
2215000	2217000	Is it related to the temperature of the material?
2217000	2219000	Yes.
2219000	2220000	Yes.
2220000	2221000	So in theory,
2221000	2223000	the lower my imagination is,
2223000	2225000	the higher its Q is, right?
2225000	2227000	Yes.
2227000	2230000	The characteristics of its resonance
2230000	2232000	will definitely be affected by temperature.
2232000	2234000	But what about its sensitivity?
2234000	2237000	What about the situation of Q downgrade?
2239000	2242000	So when I read these articles,
2242000	2245000	I naturally think of a few questions.
2245000	2246000	The first one is,
2246000	2247000	just now,
2247000	2250000	our bandwidth efficiency product,
2250000	2253000	this theoretical bound,
2253000	2255000	can the mechanical antenna
2255000	2258000	make a similar prediction?
2258000	2261000	What is its definition?
2261000	2263000	This is the first question.
2263000	2264000	The second question is,
2264000	2266000	is the mechanical antenna
2266000	2271000	below or beyond the Q limit?
2271000	2274000	If it is below the Q limit,
2274000	2277000	how close can it approach the theoretical bound?
2277000	2280000	Does it have any practical application value?
2280000	2282000	These are all questions
2282000	2285000	that have not yet been answered.
2285000	2288000	Can I ask a few questions?
2288000	2291000	I'm just curious.
2291000	2293000	So generally speaking,
2293000	2298000	what materials are currently used?
2298000	2300000	The second question is,
2300000	2302000	I think the mechanical wave
2302000	2303000	has a high Q,
2303000	2306000	but is it impossible
2306000	2309000	to make an amplifier component?
2309000	2312000	No one has done this before.
2312000	2315000	Is it possible to do
2315000	2320000	a mechanical amplifier component?
2320000	2324000	The first question is,
2324000	2325000	what did you just say?
2325000	2326000	I forgot.
2326000	2328000	Sorry.
2328000	2330000	Generally speaking,
2330000	2333000	what materials are used?
2333000	2335000	Materials.
2335000	2336000	For example,
2336000	2338000	this is called electric.
2338000	2342000	It can hold charge
2342000	2345000	and make some mechanical motion.
2345000	2347000	This is called magnet.
2347000	2349000	But you can also apply
2349000	2352000	the dipole moment in the material.
2352000	2353000	For example,
2353000	2357000	there are some piezoelectric materials
2357000	2360000	or ferromagnetic materials.
2360000	2364000	You can let the dipole moment
2364000	2368000	generate an equivalent current or magnetic current
2368000	2370000	to generate electromagnetic radiation.
2370000	2373000	So the main materials used are
2373000	2374000	piezoelectric materials,
2374000	2376000	ferromagnetic materials,
2376000	2383000	or purely charged and magnetic materials.
2383000	2385000	The second question is,
2385000	2390000	why did you mention
2390000	2395000	the mechanical amplifier?
2396000	2401000	I think it's easy to make an amplifier
2401000	2404000	in a battery.
2404000	2412000	But if you receive a mechanical wave,
2412000	2416000	do you need to...
2416000	2421000	It's not difficult to send a mechanical wave,
2421000	2423000	but how do you receive it
2423000	2426000	and how do you amplify it?
2426000	2431000	Is this a more realistic question?
2431000	2434000	Or do you want to turn it into an electronic signal
2434000	2436000	and amplify it?
2436000	2442000	I think if I'm thinking about
2442000	2444000	applying this,
2444000	2446000	I would think about
2446000	2448000	what difficulties it faces
2448000	2450000	on the receiving end.
2451000	2454000	But this seems a bit too broad,
2454000	2457000	so I don't know if you...
2457000	2458000	Like you said,
2458000	2462000	this is a very deep research.
2462000	2463000	For example,
2463000	2466000	I know piezoelectric materials
2466000	2468000	because they already have
2468000	2470000	a lot of commercial applications,
2470000	2473000	like the Surface Acoustic Wave
2473000	2475000	or Bar Acoustic Wave.
2475000	2476000	For these,
2476000	2479000	they have some equivalent circuit models.
2479000	2481000	For example,
2481000	2482000	if you receive it,
2482000	2484000	you can turn it from an electromagnetic wave
2484000	2485000	into a mechanical wave.
2485000	2487000	Then the mechanical wave
2487000	2489000	can be equivalent to a circuit
2489000	2491000	and do some calculations and matching
2491000	2493000	with the circuit.
2493000	2495000	But the difficulties I'm facing now
2495000	2497000	will be discussed later.
2497000	2500000	These are also other difficulties.
2500000	2501000	In the case of piezoelectric,
2501000	2504000	the properties are well-known.
2509000	2512000	This is called multi-fluid material.
2512000	2514000	At first glance,
2514000	2515000	I thought,
2515000	2516000	what is this word?
2516000	2519000	If we look at it from this picture,
2519000	2521000	it's electrically polarizable
2521000	2523000	or magnetically polarizable.
2523000	2528000	There is a intersection between them.
2528000	2533000	There is ferroelectric and ferromagnetic.
2533000	2535000	At the same time,
2535000	2537000	there is ferroelectric and ferromagnetic,
2537000	2539000	which is called multi-fluid.
2539000	2542000	If it is a physical property,
2542000	2543000	for example,
2543000	2545000	electrical will have electrical polarization,
2545000	2547000	and the applied magnetic field
2547000	2549000	will have magnetization.
2549000	2552000	There will be a corresponding
2552000	2554000	piezoelectricity between them.
2554000	2555000	For example,
2555000	2557000	from stress to electrical field,
2557000	2559000	electrical field becomes stress.
2559000	2564000	This is called magnetoelectricity.
2564000	2566000	Magnetoelectricity is
2566000	2568000	when you give it a stress,
2568000	2570000	it can become a magnetic field.
2570000	2572000	This is the relationship between the changes.
2572000	2573000	There are some materials,
2573000	2576000	but the research progress
2576000	2579000	between them is not the same.
2579000	2581000	In 2015,
2581000	2583000	the UCLA group,
2583000	2586000	we cooperated with their group.
2587000	2590000	They proposed this structure,
2590000	2592000	that is to say,
2592000	2594000	using MANS.
2594000	2595000	Basically,
2595000	2598000	it is the
2598000	2601000	far-acoustic resonator.
2601000	2602000	However,
2602000	2604000	it allows the stress,
2604000	2605000	the force,
2605000	2609000	to drive the other ferromagnetic material.
2609000	2610000	Then,
2610000	2613000	the magnetic dipole moment
2614000	2616000	will generate the same magnetic current,
2616000	2617000	generating electromagnetic radiation.
2617000	2621000	Why did they develop such a component?
2621000	2623000	In addition to what I just said,
2623000	2626000	it may have a relatively high frequency application.
2626000	2627000	In addition,
2627000	2631000	it can be integrated with some materials.
2631000	2633000	However,
2633000	2636000	my research is based on this research
2636000	2637000	to make some extensions.
2637000	2638000	However,
2638000	2639000	I also hope that
2639000	2642000	since I have decided to stay in Taiwan,
2642000	2645000	I can develop this component.
2645000	2649000	The governing equation behind it
2649000	2651000	is basically
2651000	2653000	in addition to Maxwell's equation,
2653000	2654000	Newton's law,
2654000	2655000	there is another one
2655000	2656000	to describe its
2656000	2658000	magnetization behavior,
2658000	2661000	called Landau-Lipschitz-Gilbert equation.
2661000	2665000	This equation basically describes
2665000	2668000	that if your electron has an external applied
2668000	2669000	magnetic field,
2669000	2672000	it will have a precession
2672000	2674000	and some loss.
2674000	2676000	It describes the relationship
2676000	2679000	between your magnetization
2679000	2682000	and your applied magnetic field
2682000	2684000	dynamically.
2684000	2686000	They use this model
2686000	2689000	to do FDTD numerical simulation calculation
2689000	2691000	to calculate
2691000	2695000	its theoretical performance and upper limit.
2695000	2697000	It was published in 2015.
2697000	2699000	In 2017,
2699000	2701000	this structure,
2701000	2702000	Sound of Nature,
2702000	2705000	said that
2705000	2707000	it has measured this signal
2707000	2710000	in the experiment.
2710000	2712000	If you look at this picture,
2712000	2713000	it uses a home antenna
2713000	2715000	at 2.5 GHz.
2715000	2717000	It has a similar structure.
2717000	2719000	Ammonium nitride is a PLA electric material.
2719000	2725000	Iron is another kind of magnetic material.
2725000	2727000	Ferromagnetic material.
2727000	2729000	The contrast of these two pictures
2729000	2730000	is that
2730000	2732000	the strength of the signal
2732000	2734000	in their operating band
2734000	2735000	is obvious.
2735000	2737000	This is a reflector.
2737000	2739000	It has energy in it,
2739000	2740000	but its reflector
2740000	2742000	does not have radiation.
2742000	2744000	It has a signal
2744000	2746000	about 20 dB older.
2746000	2748000	It claims that
2748000	2750000	its device
2750000	2753000	is experimentally successful.
2753000	2754000	However,
2754000	2755000	I have some questions.
2755000	2756000	One is that
2756000	2758000	the UCLA group
2758000	2761000	is Northeastern.
2761000	2763000	The UCLA group
2763000	2765000	has not been able to do it yet.
2765000	2767000	The other is that
2767000	2769000	it claims that
2769000	2771000	it does not need
2771000	2773000	a biased magnetic field.
2773000	2775000	It can also have a strong coupling.
2775000	2777000	This is what
2777000	2782000	we usually think about
2782000	2787000	when we think about radiation theory.
2787000	2791000	The UCLA group and I
2791000	2793000	have used
2793000	2795000	Ferromagnetic Resonance,
2795000	2797000	or FMR,
2797000	2800000	to describe radiation.
2800000	2803000	If you want to produce FMR,
2803000	2806000	you must have a biased magnetic field.
2806000	2809000	This is explained by
2809000	2811000	H-current law.
2811000	2814000	I am not sure if it is true,
2814000	2816000	but they have published Nature.
2816000	2819000	Next is my research.
2819000	2822000	Based on this structure,
2822000	2827000	I did some extension work,
2827000	2832000	from simulation to actual experiment.
2832000	2836000	My starting point is extension work.
2837000	2841000	We are running out of time,
2841000	2846000	so you may have to finish it as soon as possible.
2846000	2847000	OK.
2847000	2849000	The rest is just some results.
2849000	2851000	I will try to speed up.
2851000	2853000	So,
2853000	2855000	based on their design structure,
2855000	2858000	I was wondering if it is possible
2858000	2861000	to explore some of the features of their project.
2861000	2863000	So I referred to some
2863000	2865000	design of resonator.
2865000	2868000	The reason for doing this is
2868000	2871000	because their operating direction
2871000	2874000	is longitudinal.
2874000	2877000	If you have something made of metal,
2877000	2881000	your radiation efficiency will be downgraded.
2881000	2884000	This is the property of image current.
2884000	2887000	So I was wondering
2887000	2890000	if it is possible that it is not longitudinal,
2890000	2892000	but lateral,
2892000	2895000	implanted resonance.
2895000	2897000	This implanted resonance
2897000	2900000	may be able to do some planning.
2900000	2904000	This article was published the year before.
2904000	2906000	It was in conference,
2906000	2908000	because it was not done yet.
2908000	2910000	So I designed this structure.
2910000	2913000	I used COMSOL simulation,
2913000	2916000	and then used an ideal and simple assumption
2916000	2919000	to calculate the radiation.
2922000	2924000	So,
2924000	2927000	I designed this structure.
2927000	2930000	First,
2930000	2933000	if you want to generate a plant,
2933000	2937000	you need two orthogonal resonant pairs,
2937000	2940000	and a 90-degree difference.
2940000	2943000	In this case,
2943000	2946000	you can generate an original model.
2946000	2951000	I calculated the magnitude.
2951000	2954000	Then,
2954000	2957000	I used the magnitude
2957000	2960000	to make some initial assumptions.
2960000	2963000	The stress field and magnetic current
2963000	2966000	are proportional.
2966000	2969000	Then, I calculated the original radiation,
2969000	2972000	the electromagnetic radiation.
2972000	2975000	Then, I used the original radiation
2975000	2978000	to calculate the original performance.
2978000	2980000	Then,
2980000	2983000	I calculated this initial picture,
2983000	2986000	which is directly related to the model,
2986000	2989000	and its radiation pattern,
2989000	2992000	which is a circular polarized dipole.
2992000	2995000	You can observe that
2995000	2998000	in very low frequency,
2998000	3001000	which is not the resonant band,
3001000	3004000	the magnitude is small,
3004000	3007000	but the motion is mostly circular.
3007000	3010000	In the operating band,
3010000	3013000	the magnitude is much larger,
3013000	3016000	and the motion is circular.
3016000	3019000	In other bands,
3019000	3022000	the motion is almost non-circular.
3022000	3025000	That's about it.
3025000	3028000	I have a question.
3028000	3031000	You show the actual numbers.
3031000	3034000	Your bandwidth is micron,
3034000	3037000	and it's 10 to the power of 6 to the power of 7.
3037000	3040000	Is the displacement actually nanometer or sub-nanometer?
3040000	3043000	Yes.
3043000	3046000	This is a simulation.
3046000	3049000	But at the end of the day,
3049000	3052000	if you want to make a device,
3052000	3055000	your environment may be like an optical table.
3055000	3058000	Otherwise, the noise will be super loud.
3058000	3061000	Yes.
3061000	3064000	I will put my experiment results at the end.
3064000	3067000	No, that's called verifying your theoretical calculations.
3067000	3070000	No problem.
3070000	3073000	It should be downgraded.
3073000	3076000	I don't know.
3076000	3079000	I will talk about this later.
3079000	3082000	In fact, this size is very idealized.
3082000	3085000	In fact, our fabrication process...
3085000	3088000	I think I showed the diameter.
3088000	3091000	How much is it?
3095000	3098000	This simulation case is an idealized case.
3098000	3101000	If the motion is circular,
3101000	3104000	it means the radius is close to the height.
3104000	3107000	There will be a circular mode.
3107000	3110000	But in fact,
3110000	3113000	the material cannot be made so small and so thick.
3113000	3116000	So it will become like a disk.
3116000	3119000	If I simulate with a disk,
3119000	3122000	its mesh will become very complicated.
3122000	3125000	Because its width and thickness are a bit different.
3125000	3128000	You may have a very fine mesh here.
3128000	3131000	Then your mesh element will become a lot.
3131000	3134000	Then the calculation will be very long and not very accurate.
3134000	3137000	So you will see some strange results.
3137000	3140000	If it is a circular motion of a disk,
3140000	3143000	is it really feasible?
3143000	3146000	I think I have some problems with simulation.
3146000	3149000	Anyway, let's do it.
3149000	3152000	So the first version,
3152000	3155000	I asked UCL to make a chip.
3155000	3158000	This chip is the bow antenna in front.
3158000	3161000	In order to feed a 90-degree angle,
3161000	3164000	I made a coupler.
3164000	3167000	Then it will feed a 90-degree angle.
3167000	3170000	This is the proportion map.
3170000	3173000	Then I made a matrix.
3173000	3176000	One is nickel.
3176000	3179000	They used nickel earlier.
3179000	3182000	But in fact, nickel cannot be used in high-frequency applications.
3182000	3185000	The material is also a big problem.
3185000	3188000	Then there are different radius sizes.
3188000	3191000	Then I use a home antenna in the far-field region to receive.
3192000	3195000	The one below is the magnetic field to be biased.
3195000	3198000	It's DC.
3198000	3201000	Then I use a patch antenna to compare.
3201000	3204000	This patch antenna is fabricated.
3204000	3207000	Its receiving wall and its noise
3207000	3210000	are about 20 dB different.
3210000	3213000	It's where the reflection coefficient is.
3213000	3216000	I want to compare it with the environment noise.
3216000	3219000	There should be a difference.
3220000	3223000	Anyway, this is the band I designed.
3223000	3226000	Theoretically, this is what you want to see.
3230000	3233000	This picture is S21.
3233000	3236000	This is patched.
3236000	3239000	This is patched.
3239000	3242000	This is patched.
3242000	3245000	This is its background noise, red.
3245000	3248000	This is where the signal strength is.
3248000	3251000	I want to see if it can be compared with the noise.
3251000	3254000	I want to see if it can be compared with the noise.
3254000	3257000	Obviously, S21 is patched.
3257000	3260000	Obviously, S21 is patched.
3260000	3263000	4-pole and low-pole,
3263000	3266000	I made another standard.
3266000	3269000	I soldered a small 50-ohm resistor.
3269000	3272000	I soldered a small 50-ohm resistor.
3272000	3275000	I soldered a small 50-ohm resistor.
3275000	3278000	I compared it with the resistance of the terminal.
3278000	3281000	I used a bandwidth.
3281000	3284000	I compared it with two things.
3284000	3287000	One is patched.
3287000	3290000	The other is the terminal resistor.
3290000	3293000	4-pole is the actual result.
3293000	3296000	4-pole is the actual result.
3296000	3299000	This picture is a little bit wrong.
3299000	3302000	This picture is a little bit wrong.
3302000	3305000	There is a false wire.
3305000	3308000	It is not corrected.
3308000	3311000	Blue.
3311000	3314000	My first measurement was 2 years ago.
3314000	3317000	My first measurement was 2 years ago.
3317000	3320000	It is not very successful.
3320000	3323000	Original antenna radiation.
3323000	3326000	The 4-pole and low-pole are not clearly visible.
3326000	3329000	The 4-pole and low-pole are not clearly visible.
3329000	3332000	Specific frequency band.
3332000	3335000	I compared it with the S11.
3335000	3338000	It is not very visible.
3338000	3341000	It is not very visible.
3341000	3344000	It is not very visible.
3344000	3347000	It is not very visible.
3347000	3350000	It is not very visible.
3350000	3353000	It is not very visible.
3353000	3356000	The other reference.
3356000	3359000	The showed is the difference.
3359000	3362000	The showed is the difference.
3362000	3365000	The shown is the difference.
3365000	3368000	The shown is the difference.
3368000	3371000	The shown is the difference.
3371000	3374000	The shown is the difference.
3374000	3377000	The shown is the difference.
3377000	3380000	The shown is the difference.
3380000	3383000	The shown is the difference.
3383000	3388000	So the final conclusion is
3388000	3391000	So the final conclusion is
3391000	3394000	My coupler itself has radiation
3394000	3399000	So how to eliminate coupler radiation
3399000	3402000	So the first step is
3402000	3405000	I don't want to do the original plan
3405000	3409000	I just look at one of its modes
3409000	3412000	For one mode, I just need to add an electrode
3412000	3416000	No need to fit such a large coupler
3416000	3418000	No need to fit such a large coupler
3418000	3420000	The second step is
3420000	3422000	Even if I want to look at radiation
3422000	3425000	I need to make sure the material has a circular mode
3425000	3428000	So what I'm doing now is
3428000	3430000	I need to look at the material
3430000	3432000	To see if it really has a circular mode
3432000	3434000	This can be done using some mechanics
3434000	3437000	To look at the vibration mode
3437000	3439000	After these two things are confirmed
3439000	3442000	We'll see if there's a circular mode
3442000	3444000	We'll see if there's a circular mode
3444000	3446000	In terms of mechanics
3446000	3449000	No one has ever discussed the circular mode
3449000	3451000	In terms of the circular mode
3451000	3454000	If it's for a system with poor signal quality
3454000	3456000	It's very important
3456000	3458000	Because using the circular mode
3458000	3462000	Improves the transmission of data
3462000	3466000	But in the end, this is a bigger problem
3466000	3471000	In addition to the theoretical questions I mentioned earlier
3471000	3473000	And the structure
3473000	3477000	Which application can actually be used
3477000	3480000	To achieve this performance
3480000	3484000	At the moment, I'm doing some extensions on this work
3484000	3488000	But this is actually a pretty new topic
3488000	3491000	There's still a lot to explore
3491000	3493000	That's all for my speech
3497000	3499000	Thank you
3504000	3507000	Does anyone have any questions?
3512000	3515000	If not, I'll ask a question
3515000	3519000	I have a question about
3519000	3525000	The working mechanism of your system
3525000	3528000	Can you go back to the structure diagram
3528000	3530000	There's a piezoelectric
3530000	3533000	And there's a ferroelectric on top
3537000	3540000	Can you explain a little bit
3540000	3543000	How this thing
3543000	3546000	Generates and receives signals?
3550000	3553000	Let's look at this diagram
3553000	3558000	If we look at the diagram on the right
3558000	3562000	The first thing that the piezoelectric material does
3562000	3564000	Is that there's an electrode on both sides
3564000	3566000	And there's a voltage difference
3566000	3569000	Which creates an electrode
3569000	3571000	And this electrode
3571000	3573000	The alternating electrode
3573000	3578000	Will produce a deformation in the opamp material
3578000	3582000	And this deformation creates a resonance
3582000	3585000	So this is an electrical field
3585000	3589000	Which becomes a resonance through the piezoelectric electricity
3589000	3592000	The resonance of the structure
3592000	3596000	Will cause a change in the stress
3596000	3599000	And in the magnetostrictive material
3599000	3601000	Its characteristic is
3601000	3603000	If it has an applied stress field
3603000	3608000	The magnetization or magnetic dipole moment
3609000	3612000	Or its internal magnetic field
3612000	3620000	Will have something to do with the applied stress
3620000	3625000	So its magnetization will change
3625000	3630000	But this is also a problem and challenge
3630000	3632000	Because the piezoelectric electricity
3632000	3634000	Has a commercial application
3634000	3637000	So its behavior is well known
3637000	3640000	But in the magnetostrictive material
3640000	3644000	Its theory is not so complete
3644000	3647000	We should have
3647000	3649000	Also been related to G.E.F.
3649000	3651000	When they discovered this phenomenon
3651000	3655000	And it's more primitive
3655000	3657000	If you apply a stress
3657000	3659000	It will cause deformation
3659000	3665000	And the magnetic field of its beam will change
3666000	3673000	So they want to use this design
3673000	3679000	To produce dynamic magnetization in the resonance
3679000	3682000	Theoretically, dynamic magnetization
3682000	3684000	Is equivalent to magnetic current
3684000	3688000	Just like AC current
3688000	3690000	If you have AC magnetic current
3690000	3693000	It will also produce electromagnetic radiation
3693000	3694000	That's about it
3694000	3695000	But the problem is
3695000	3700000	There are many discussions about this material
3700000	3701000	For example
3701000	3704000	What is the effect of its power absorption
3704000	3707000	And what is the efficiency of its coupling
3707000	3709000	And so on
3709000	3712000	What is the acoustic buffer?
3712000	3714000	This thing
3714000	3719000	They want the fundamental mode
3719000	3721000	The standing wave
3721000	3726000	This is related to their theoretical prediction
3726000	3728000	When you are in the resonance
3728000	3731000	For example, you must be 2 times the wave
3731000	3733000	2 times the 3rd wave
3733000	3740000	Is the second wave the stress wave?
3740000	3745000	Yes, it's the mechanical stress resonant wave
3745000	3749000	So that thing is to form a cavity
3749000	3752000	Yes, it's to make the standing wave
3752000	3754000	The strongest stress field
3754000	3758000	To work on the magnetic material
3758000	3760000	Theoretically, we apply the strongest stress field
3760000	3766000	It should have the strongest magnetic field change
3766000	3770000	So they added this acoustic buffer
3771000	3781000	Is the magnetic radiation as strong as the electrical radiation?
3781000	3784000	I rarely heard of someone
3784000	3788000	It's usually an electric dipole
3788000	3793000	It's rare to have a real magnetic dipole
3793000	3797000	There is a type of antenna
3798000	3800000	It's called loop antenna
3800000	3803000	It's like a donut
3803000	3806000	Loop antenna is a loop current
3806000	3808000	We know that according to
3808000	3810000	I forgot the current
3810000	3812000	Anyway, it's a loop current
3812000	3815000	It's equivalent to a magnetic dipole
3815000	3817000	Alternative magnetic dipole
3817000	3819000	So there is a design called loop antenna
3819000	3821000	When we calculate
3821000	3823000	Sometimes we use this equivalent theory
3823000	3826000	To calculate its radiation with magnetic dipole
3826000	3828000	Its characteristics are indeed different
3828000	3830000	For example, it may be more inductive
3830000	3832000	Or some characteristics are different
3832000	3834000	But it does have this
3834000	3836000	It's called loop antenna
3836000	3838000	OK
3838000	3841000	Another question I'm interested in
3841000	3843000	You just mentioned
3843000	3847000	This is the original signal
3847000	3850000	It will make your transmission better
3850000	3853000	It should be better than signal to noise
3853000	3854000	Yes
3854000	3856000	Why is this?
3856000	3858000	Well
3858000	3860000	One is
3860000	3862000	Under this architecture
3862000	3866000	Because it's a longitudinal magnetic current
3866000	3869000	According to image theory
3869000	3871000	If it's on a
3871000	3873000	Infinite metal surface
3873000	3875000	Actually its direction
3875000	3877000	Its radiation will cancel
3877000	3878000	Their original design
3878000	3880000	They didn't consider this problem
3880000	3882000	Of course, if you don't need to put it on any metal plane
3882000	3884000	You won't have this problem
3884000	3886000	But it's possible that
3886000	3889000	Your antenna is still placed on some metal
3889000	3891000	So you will have this problem
3891000	3893000	In longitudinal
3893000	3896000	This is the antenna design itself
3896000	3899000	I didn't put it in the video
3899000	3901000	It's
3901000	3903000	Originality
3903000	3906000	It's usually used in satellite communication
3906000	3907000	Why?
3907000	3909000	Because satellite communication
3909000	3911000	Has very high requirements for sensitivity
3911000	3912000	In fact
3912000	3914000	General antenna
3914000	3916000	If you don't use originality
3916000	3918000	But random or linear
3918000	3921000	There will be some problems when it's transmitted
3921000	3922000	For example
3922000	3923000	The first one is
3923000	3924000	If you want to receive
3924000	3926000	You need alignment
3926000	3928000	Then you need to align the antenna
3928000	3929000	That's a lot of trouble
3929000	3931000	Originality won't have this problem
3931000	3933000	The second one is
3933000	3935000	For example, in many architectures
3935000	3937000	When it's reflected and transmitted
3938000	3942000	The loss of originality will be much smaller
3942000	3943000	OK
3943000	3947000	So there may be differences between S and P in the antenna
3948000	3949000	S and P
3949000	3951000	Like booster angle
3951000	3953000	S-Wave or P-Wave
3953000	3955000	The reflection rate is different
3955000	3957000	Or
3957000	3960000	I didn't understand this in detail
3960000	3961000	But
3961000	3963000	They will talk about something called
3963000	3964000	Faraday effect
3964000	3965000	What else?
3965000	3967000	Multipath loss
3967000	3970000	But if you have very high requirements for the system
3970000	3972000	I usually want to use originality
3972000	3975000	Just because of our mobile phones and Wi-Fi
3975000	3977000	There is no such thing as system requirements
3977000	3978000	Just say whatever
3978000	3979000	But if you are
3979000	3981000	To satellite or military
3981000	3983000	If the sensitivity requirement is very high
3983000	3985000	I would prefer to use originality
3985000	3986000	It also has
3986000	3988000	Linearity is a direction of modulation
3988000	3991000	Originality can also double its capacity
3992000	3995000	It's kind of like a better choice
3995000	3997000	But it's usually more difficult to implement
3997000	3999000	OK, I see
3999000	4000000	Thank you
4007000	4009000	Is there any other questions?
4012000	4014000	May I ask
4014000	4017000	What is the thickness of the electrode?
4017000	4019000	Between the piezoelectric
4019000	4021000	And magnetostrict layer
4023000	4025000	What material is it?
4025000	4031000	The thickness of the electrode here
4031000	4036000	I think it's about
4036000	4037000	It should not be
4037000	4038000	It should be 0.1 micrometer
4038000	4039000	It's very, very thin
4039000	4041000	Then my material
4041000	4043000	Color is according to them
4043000	4045000	That is, the process
4045000	4047000	They should be using
4048000	4051000	They started with PT
4051000	4056000	But the last fabricated thing
4058000	4062000	This is where it connects to the electrode above
4062000	4065000	I remember they used PT
4065000	4066000	It's thin
4066000	4068000	And then the electrode
4068000	4070000	Will affect its resonance
4070000	4072000	There will be some
4072000	4073000	Mod
4073000	4074000	Resonance mod
4074000	4076000	And then there will be some loss
4076000	4077000	But relatively speaking
4077000	4078000	Not so serious
4078000	4079000	but
4079000	4081000	If you want to optimize
4081000	4084000	Electrode factors will also need to be considered
4084000	4087000	Because it may be like a buffer
4087000	4088000	So you
4088000	4090000	Your stress may not necessarily
4090000	4092000	Will affect the
4092000	4095000	Magnetostrict material
4102000	4105000	I understand what you mean
4106000	4108000	Because if you want
4108000	4112000	Resonance stress field
4112000	4116000	It needs an air cavity design
4116000	4119000	That is
4119000	4121000	In bioacoustic wave resonator
4121000	4124000	It will have different designs
4124000	4126000	You will reduce
4126000	4128000	There is a kind of
4128000	4131000	You have to try to keep
4131000	4133000	Its energy in this structure
4133000	4134000	To correct
4134000	4135000	It may have an air cavity
4135000	4139000	Or a reflector design
4144000	4147000	Because your theory is
4147000	4149000	I hope your strain
4149000	4151000	Can cause a magnetic field
4151000	4153000	Change
4153000	4154000	but
4154000	4155000	I'm talking about your buffer layer now
4155000	4157000	Because your government
4157000	4158000	Must be small
4158000	4160000	Because it is a p-zoid material
4160000	4162000	Maybe less than
4162000	4164000	One nanometer
4164000	4165000	Yes
4165000	4166000	Then you have a layer on top
4166000	4168000	Such a thick metal
4168000	4170000	I don't know
4170000	4173000	Magnetostrict
4173000	4176000	How much magnetic field
4178000	4180000	The electrode he used
4180000	4183000	That is
4183000	4185000	The electrode he actually fabricated
4185000	4188000	Not as thick as intended
4188000	4190000	But indeed
4190000	4191000	In fact, how much
4191000	4193000	Magnetization change
4193000	4195000	Also
4195000	4197000	Still studying
4197000	4198000	That is
4198000	4201000	Either you look at its power absorption
4201000	4202000	Or look at it
4202000	4204000	At least you have to make sure
4204000	4205000	It has power absorption
4205000	4207000	You can look at its radiation
4207000	4210000	That is
4210000	4211000	Now is
4211000	4212000	For example, this
4212000	4213000	Magnetostrict
4213000	4216000	Some characteristics of power absorption
4216000	4218000	Everyone is still studying
4219000	4221000	I'm just curious
4221000	4223000	Like your structure
4223000	4224000	How do you design
4224000	4226000	The frequency of your work
4226000	4228000	Basically just
4228000	4230000	That depends on
4230000	4233000	Is the thickness of the material of the magnetostrict
4233000	4235000	No, it's the total thickness
4237000	4239000	Roughly speaking
4239000	4240000	That's right
4240000	4244000	But I use COMSOL first
4244000	4245000	That is
4245000	4247000	In theory, each mode of it
4247000	4249000	It should be able to calculate
4249000	4250000	Geometric
4250000	4251000	Some relationships
4251000	4252000	Resonance
4252000	4254000	But roughly the thickness
4254000	4256000	The main thing is to determine its resonance frequency
4256000	4258000	That's right
4258000	4262000	How many modes do you want it to work
4262000	4263000	That is
4263000	4264000	Fundamental mode
4264000	4266000	That is
4266000	4267000	I see
4267000	4268000	OK
4268000	4270000	Thank you
4270000	4272000	Then
4272000	4273000	At first
4273000	4274000	I will use COMSOL first
4274000	4276000	To simulate
4276000	4277000	Maybe this
4277000	4278000	The mode you want
4278000	4280000	Its characteristic mode
4280000	4282000	What frequency is it
4292000	4294000	I have a question
4294000	4295000	Yes
4295000	4296000	That is
4296000	4298000	Where is your device
4298000	4301000	You said you are teaching UCLA, right?
4303000	4304000	I am with
4304000	4305000	That is
4305000	4307000	They are a center called
4307000	4309000	California
4309000	4310000	Nano system
4310000	4311000	What
4311000	4312000	Then it is actually
4312000	4314000	Someone is responsible for theoretical
4314000	4315000	Someone is responsible for fabrication
4315000	4317000	Someone is responsible for material development
4317000	4318000	Then I am with them
4318000	4320000	Fabrication group
4320000	4321000	Cooperate
4321000	4322000	So I put my design
4322000	4323000	Draw a layout for it
4323000	4324000	Then he helped me make it
4324000	4325000	Then send it to me
4325000	4326000	Then I measure
4326000	4328000	But I am now
4328000	4330000	I hope I can be in Taiwan directly
4330000	4332000	To develop these materials
4332000	4334000	You finished answering my question
4334000	4335000	That is
4335000	4336000	I want to ask Taiwan
4336000	4337000	Can you do this in Taiwan
4337000	4338000	Oh yeah
4338000	4339000	I am now
4339000	4340000	Because actually
4340000	4341000	Like Taichung Institute of Technology
4341000	4342000	They may
4342000	4343000	Someone was studying before
4343000	4345000	Surface Acoustic Wave Filter
4345000	4347000	Or something
4347000	4348000	But as far as I know
4348000	4349000	All over Taiwan
4349000	4350000	No one is studying now
4350000	4352000	No one is doing
4352000	4353000	That is
4353000	4355000	BoFilter with commercial application
4355000	4356000	But in fact
4356000	4357000	BoFilter this thing has been
4357000	4358000	What brocon
4358000	4359000	Avago
4359000	4360000	They are already
4360000	4361000	It is already
4361000	4364000	Commercial
4364000	4366000	But Taiwan does not have this technology now
4366000	4367000	That is
4367000	4368000	BoFilter
4368000	4369000	In fact, it is for
4369000	4370000	Compared with SoFilter
4370000	4372000	Its high-frequency performance
4372000	4374000	Is much better
4374000	4376000	It can be up to 6GHz
4376000	4379000	It can be a good filter
4381000	4382000	Then very small
4382000	4384000	Probably
4384000	4385000	1mm
4385000	4387000	Or smaller
4388000	4390000	1mm2
4392000	4393000	Next I have a
4393000	4395000	It's my little suggestion
4395000	4397000	It's not common
4397000	4398000	It's not a problem
4398000	4399000	That is
4399000	4401000	I guess Ted should be the same as me
4401000	4402000	That is, we may all have a little
4402000	4403000	Occupational disease
4403000	4404000	There is a little bias
4404000	4405000	I think this
4405000	4406000	You
4406000	4408000	Measure this thing for the first time
4408000	4409000	To verify its quality
4409000	4410000	Or to deny
4410000	4411000	That
4411000	4412000	Northeastern quality
4412000	4413000	I think this
4413000	4414000	This may be you
4414000	4415000	Not only do you have to go to the light table
4415000	4416000	You still have to low temperature
4416000	4417000	You may have to give it a cover
4417000	4418000	That
4418000	4419000	New Metal Cam
4419000	4421000	What to cover the magnetic field of the earth
4421000	4422000	Should be
4422000	4424000	You really have to be able to control your
4424000	4425000	Your
4425000	4426000	That field
4426000	4427000	You should say you have to control your
4427000	4428000	Background
4428000	4429000	To be very low
4429000	4431000	May be able to see
4431000	4433000	Yes, that's right
4433000	4435000	I think you have to vacuum
4435000	4436000	Of course
4436000	4437000	You have to vacuum at low temperature
4437000	4439000	Otherwise you have to turn the air into ice
4439000	4440000	Put it in
4440000	4441000	Yes, it should be
4441000	4442000	Should be
4442000	4443000	I think so too
4443000	4444000	So Ted, do you think so?
4445000	4446000	Yes, it is
4446000	4447000	Because
4447000	4449000	Something with wind power is
4449000	4451000	I think it needs
4451000	4453000	How much 4K
4453000	4454000	At least
4454000	4456000	I think this is my opinion
4456000	4457000	Is
4457000	4458000	You
4458000	4459000	I'm talking like this now
4459000	4461000	Oh, you have to control your environment
4461000	4462000	To do this
4462000	4463000	This measurement
4463000	4465000	It feels like it's not commercializable
4465000	4466000	Or
4466000	4467000	More practical
4467000	4468000	Technology
4468000	4470000	But I think this is the first step
4470000	4471000	So I don't think he
4471000	4473000	It's impossible to pull up in the future
4473000	4474000	But I
4474000	4475000	I look at it now
4475000	4477000	You have to do the first measurement now
4477000	4478000	May be
4478000	4479000	It's not that your device is bad
4479000	4481000	Or your simulation is wrong
4481000	4482000	Or something
4482000	4483000	I think it may be
4483000	4484000	Measurement
4484000	4485000	Not easy to do
4485000	4486000	But there should be a chance
4486000	4487000	Yes
4487000	4488000	Yes
4488000	4490000	Like that
4490000	4491000	Northeastern
4491000	4492000	The two of them
4492000	4493000	That thing
4493000	4494000	Since 2017
4494000	4495000	There is no more
4495000	4496000	Repeat work
4498000	4499000	Because I know how to do
4499000	4501000	Graduate from graduate school
4501000	4502000	Ha ha ha ha
4505000	4506000	Is
4506000	4508000	They switched to low-frequency applications
4510000	4511000	Then
4511000	4512000	Yes
4512000	4513000	So
4513000	4514000	I don't know
4514000	4515000	Anyway, I just
4515000	4517000	Keep going
4519000	4520000	OK
4521000	4523000	Is there any other questions?
4528000	4529000	If not
4529000	4530000	Then I'll put that first
4530000	4531000	Recording
4531000	4532000	Turn it off
