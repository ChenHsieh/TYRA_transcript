1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today, I am very honored to invite Dr. Yu Song-Huan, our speaker, to give us an online presentation.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dr. Yu Song-Huan's school and research unit is the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
His main research area is focused on bioinformatics.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today, he is going to talk about the topic of

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Energizing the Three-Arm Knife for RNA-Seq-Based Entotation of Bacterial Archaeogenomics.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, Dr. Yu Song-Huan, please introduce the topic to us.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you for the introduction.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Basically, what I am going to talk about today is a tool for analyzing biological information.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This tool is mainly used in the analysis of large data, which is often used and very important.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It is mainly used in RNA sequencing.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Later, I will introduce the basic background.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We are focused on the providence of gene assistance for bacteria and fungi.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I believe that not all the audience comes from biology.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, I will briefly introduce the background.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I believe that quite a few speakers have talked about the background.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If I am not clear enough, you can also go back and look at the part of the speakers.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They are all very good.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The whole organism needs to undergo a process of normal metabolism growth.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That is, all their genes need to function normally.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We all know that genetic material is actually stored in DNA, which is the gene we are talking about.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
DNA is a structure of double-bone spiral.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can see that there are two bones here.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When the DNA is copied, it will be like a zipper.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
These two bones will be released.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then one of them will be used as a template.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
According to this template, we will have DNA polymerase.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It will read the genetic code above and then copy another bone to form a new DNA.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
However, in order for the DNA to function properly,

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in most cases, it still needs to reach the protein level.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There is a middle product called RNA in the middle.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
From DNA to RNA, we call it transcription.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's very simple.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
DNA will decompose into a single bone.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
RNA polymerase will be combined with the single-bone DNA.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It will read their genetic code and produce another single-bone structure.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We call it RNA.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
RNA can interact with the ribosome.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This process is called translation.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
These RNAs will be compared with the correct amino acid.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then it will be combined into a functional protein.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the case in most cases.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A very important topic in recent years is that

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
biologists use big data to analyze some of the phenomena of biologics.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Or to understand the situation of biological manipulation.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We can also roughly divide it into these three levels.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
DNA level, RNA level, and protein level.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
These big data studies are called biologics.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In English, it's omics.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
DNA can form genomics.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
RNA has transcriptomics.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Protein has proteomics.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Basically, it's like this.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is omics data.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They all have different levels of omics data.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We can study different projects at different levels.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Or different studies.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
For example, if we want to know the situation of the sample we get.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Maybe we need to go to DNA level.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's see if there is any change in the genome.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If we want to see if some gene mutation

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
will cause the sample we want to study

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to have a morphological change.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then we might have to do proteomics.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Different omics data have different uses.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Different research directions.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Speaking of omics data, we need to talk about

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
several important technological developments in recent years.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This led to the emergence of omics data.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
At the beginning, around the 1970s,

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
there was the first generation of sequencing.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's mainly focused on DNA.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Simply put, because when DNA is copied,

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
it needs to use nucleic acids.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Four different nucleic acids.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Simply put, C, G, A, T.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
These four different letters represent four different nucleic acids.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When copying these nucleic acids,

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
it should be said that in this DNA,

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the four nucleic acids have different sequences,

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
which leads to a difference in genetic code.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then different products will be produced.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sanger is a scientist.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He used different lights to mark these four different nucleic acids.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So you can imagine that when this DNA is to be copied,

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
this single cell will receive these fluorescent nucleic acids.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After these fluorescent lights are emitted,

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
we can use this fluorescent light.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
By detecting this fluorescent light, we can know

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
what the sequence of this gene looks like.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What is its genetic code?

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Simply put, it's like this.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is the first generation of sequencing.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The problem now is that the first generation of sequencing,

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
of course, is also used a lot.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Even now it is still in use.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But it has a few shortcomings.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The first one is that it can't be automated.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Because when we want to do this sequence,

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
we need to amplify our sample first.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Then we can do the sequence.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In the first generation,

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
it can't be automated.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The second one is that its genes need ...

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There is no way to do the overall gene.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't take all the DNA out of a cell

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and do the sequencing directly.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There is no way.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So we need to have an assumption first.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We know that this gene may ask

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
what we want.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So we do the sequence.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The third one is that

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in terms of gene sequence,

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
our target gene usually has a certain length.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So when we do the sequence,

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
there is a high probability of error.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We can imagine that

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
if we have a shorter sequence,

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
there is less chance of error.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But if our target gene is longer,

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
there is a greater chance of error.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So if there are people doing experiments,

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
we know that

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
if we do the sequence again,

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
sometimes at the end,

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
there is a lot of quality drop.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The reason is the accumulation of error.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So there are these problems.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Although there are these problems,

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
people still use it quite often.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So in the early 2000s,

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
there was another one.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We call it Next Generation Sequencing.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It is to solve the shortcomings of the first generation sequence.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Next Generation Sequencing can be done at different levels.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
For example, it can do DNA sequencing,

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and it can do RNA sequencing.

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Then it can automatically copy a large number of samples that we are interested in.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not just to get a specific gene,

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but we can get all the genes.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There is no problem with sequencing.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So it solves this problem.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How does it do it?

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's very simple.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
DNA and RNA are actually similar.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Simply put,

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
we take a cell,

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and then we lysate the outside.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then we extract the genetic material we want,

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
whether it's DNA or RNA.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Then we break it into pieces,

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
which is a relatively small piece,

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
usually 200 to 300 nucleic acid lengths.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Then we will connect the two ends with the adapter.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This adapter can be glued to the flow cell,

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
which is on this piece.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It can stick a lot of DNA.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
After that,

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
after it is glued,

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and then we go to the primer,

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
it can be easy to copy.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can see that there is a lot of DNA here.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then we use the machine to read.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We can know a lot of different DNA fragments at once.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Suddenly we may have millions,

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
even tens of millions of DNA fragments,

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
which can be sequenced by us.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
These things are good tools for us to do analysis.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Maybe it's still not clear here.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What is it for?

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I simply use a very simple example,

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
let everyone understand the use of this technology,

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
or its strength.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Simply put,

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
if we have two people today,

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
one is normal,

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
which is generally not sick,

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
nor have any bad habits.

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The second is a person who has a smoking habit.

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Then we go to take their genome cells,

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
then we go to take the genome,

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
then we go to take the genome,

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
then we go to do the sequencing.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The data we get may look like this.

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
These two are actually histograms.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can imagine the height,

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
in fact, how many DNA fragments,

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
we call DNA reads,

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
it accumulates on it.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So the higher,

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
it means that the more DNA accumulates here.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It means that its performance is higher.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Just here there is a gene A,

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
in the case of normal people,

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
it does not have a very high level of performance.

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But on people who have smoking,

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
it has a very high level of performance.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It is said that smoking will affect this gene,

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
will make this gene alive,

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
or make it perform more.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It may cause some diseases,

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
it may cause cancer, etc.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then you compare gene B,

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
there is no such situation.

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It is said that gene B is not the key gene.

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then we do not use

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
next-generation sequencing technology,

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
we may need to determine first

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
that gene A is the gene we want to study,

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
then we do the sequencing.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But in next-generation sequencing is different.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We can have no hypothesis.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We can do it in a data-driven way,

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that is, we do the sequencing first.

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We know these two people,

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
they must have something different,

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
but we do not know what gene,

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
it does not matter, we do the sequencing,

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and then we do the comparison.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
From this direction of comparison,

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
we can find a lot of candidates,

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and then we do downstream analysis.

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That is, we use next-generation sequencing,

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
we can start from hypothesis-driven,

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
sorry, I should say,

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
assumption or hypothesis-driven study,

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
into a data-driven study.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So that is,

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
we can use next-generation sequencing,

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
this way of big data,

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
to enhance or help us do biological research.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But in fact,

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
there is still a problem with this sequencing.

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
For example, we got today,

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we finished the experiment,

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
we got our data,

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and then we go to read.

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We found that there are indeed two blocks,

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
it has a high level of performance.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Now the question is,

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
we do not know what these two blocks are.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If we do not know what protein it is,

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
or do not know what gene it is,

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
we can not do downstream analysis.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So, is it possible,

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we directly use these sequencing,

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
what I do,

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
what I do now,

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
this tool is focused on RNA.

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Can we directly use RNA sequencing data,

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
we automatically find out,

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we want the genomic features.

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Where is the gene?

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What is this gene?

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Where is the protein?

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What is this protein?

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Is there a way to do this kind of thing?

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If so,

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we can do downstream analysis.

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The advantage is,

261
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
in fact,

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
how to say,

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but now,

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
of course,

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
there are a lot of public databases,

266
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
have stored the information of these annotations.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
In fact,

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
we can easily read it to our,

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
with our RNA sequencing to compare.

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
For example,

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
this CDS,

272
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that is,

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the meaning of coding sequence,

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
that is,

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the meaning of protein.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There is a protein here.

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Then we know,

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
this segment,

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
it is actually the protein performance.

280
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
OK, good.

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But now the question is,

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
RNA sequence,

283
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
in fact,

284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
contains or contains more information.

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Some useful information,

286
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
in fact,

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
not necessarily stored in these databases.

288
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The second is,

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
usually stored in these databases,

290
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
are the wild type,

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
sequencing,

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or wild type,

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
wild type annotations are more.

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But you may be in this experiment,

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
your condition is different.

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We did some of the mutation,

297
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
we did some of the different training,

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
resulting in our data may be different.

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
These annotations may not necessarily be used.

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So,

301
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
for example,

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
we are in this data,

303
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
can not see more hidden information.

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For example,

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
here is a starting value,

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
transcript starting sign,

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
abbreviated TSS.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
On both sides of the two sides,

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
there are 5' UTR and 3' UTR,

310
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that is,

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
will not be transferred out of the region.

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Look here,

313
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
there is actually a section of the transfer block,

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
but only here is the protein,

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
that is,

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
this section and this section,

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
will not be transferred into protein.

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But recently,

319
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
a lot of research has been found,

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
in fact,

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
these two blocks,

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
it may be some,

323
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
uh,

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
controlled protein,

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
where they will interact,

326
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
it will affect the later protein transfer.

327
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is a very important block,

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
but most databases

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
will not provide this information.

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There is another one here,

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
very high expression of the block,

332
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that may be a non-coding RNA,

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
we will introduce this thing in detail later.

334
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
In terms of cells,

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
we call it small non-coding RNA or SRA.

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So,

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
is there any way we can

338
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
integrate these

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
multiple genomic features,

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and then we will produce a

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
high-quality annotation

342
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
to help everyone,

343
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
so that users can use it?

344
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And is it possible to customize,

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
that is,

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
what is my RNA sequence,

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
based on my sequence data

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
to do annotation?

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Is it possible

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that we can not only know these genes,

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
we can also know its function?

352
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
These questions are our motivation

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to design this tool.

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
In fact, there are many,

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
in fact, there are many tools

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that can do these,

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
uh,

358
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
do annotation.

359
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But they all have some,

360
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
uh,

361
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
shortcomings.

362
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Most of the tools,

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
they are all based on

364
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
genome sequence.

365
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What does it mean?

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That is, they only refer to

367
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
this,

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
there are some,

369
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
uh,

370
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
for example,

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
we do bacteria,

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
some bacteria,

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
it already knows

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
what the gene code looks like.

375
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So it only based on this gene code,

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and then do the analysis.

377
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It will not look at

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
how many reads to,

379
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to, uh,

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
compare to the position we want,

381
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
or the gene we want,

382
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
these information,

383
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it will not consider.

384
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So it leads to,

385
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
this prediction,

386
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
uh,

387
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
things are not necessarily

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
in line with our needs,

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and the accuracy rate is usually

390
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
not so high.

391
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The second,

392
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
they also lack a systematic comparison.

393
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
For example,

394
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
we use a tool,

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
we go,

396
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
uh,

397
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
to predict,

398
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
uh,

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
a part of the starting point,

400
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and then we use another tool,

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we go to predict,

402
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
this,

403
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
the part of the terminus.

404
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
As a result,

405
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
we find that these two

406
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
predict the result

407
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
is contradictory.

408
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Often there is such a thing

409
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
to happen.

410
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That is to say,

411
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
they will not systematically

412
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
to compare.

413
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay.

414
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So this is,

415
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
uh,

416
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
we want to do this,

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
the reason for the analgesic,

418
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
uh,

419
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
it is the first tool,

420
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
we are using RNA sequencing,

421
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
the data,

422
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to do the genome notation.

423
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That is especially for bacteria,

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and archaea research.

425
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Now introduce the analgesic,

426
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
this tool,

427
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
uh,

428
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
its several features,

429
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
the first is that we can

430
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
analyze different protocols,

431
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
RNA sequencing data.

432
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
RNA sequencing,

433
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
it has a lot of different protocols,

434
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in order to do different purposes.

435
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Uh,

436
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
we can,

437
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
we integrate

438
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
many different

439
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
RNA sequencing protocols.

440
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The second,

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
we compare a lot of existing,

442
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
uh,

443
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
biological information tool.

444
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Then,

445
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
we do the combination,

446
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
even,

447
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we do,

448
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the optimization of variables.

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Then,

450
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
we even,

451
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
if some of the,

452
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
uh,

453
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
methods are not too good,

454
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
we do improve.

455
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If the features we want,

456
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
it does not have,

457
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
the existing tool can predict,

458
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
then we will create a new one.

459
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is a modular tool,

460
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
that is to say,

461
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
it is very flexible.

462
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The user can,

463
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
for their own needs,

464
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and then build,

465
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
build the tool you want,

466
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and then do the analysis.

467
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Then,

468
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the interface is consistent.

469
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Finally,

470
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
we will also provide some statistics,

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and visualization,

472
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
so that everyone can see,

473
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
to analyze,

474
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
your,

475
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
uh,

476
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
generated notation,

477
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
some accuracy,

478
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and information.

479
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So,

480
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the overall purpose is,

481
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
we hope to be able to produce a,

482
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
systematized,

483
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and high-quality notation,

484
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and then be able to include,

485
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
different genomic features,

486
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and then let the user can,

487
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
overall,

488
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
to see,

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
to analyze their data.

490
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Simply put,

491
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
for example,

492
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Lego,

493
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
piece by piece,

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Lego piece,

495
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that is,

496
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
RNA sequencing reads.

497
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Then,

498
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
of course,

499
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
we can add other information,

500
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
but it is not necessary.

501
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
After that,

502
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
we can assemble,

503
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
into a variety of different models.

504
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
These models,

505
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
can be tailored to the user's needs,

506
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
you can assemble,

507
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the model you want,

508
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and then do your prediction.

509
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In the end,

510
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
it will give you a,

511
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
high-quality notation.

512
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
At present,

513
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Jessica has been able to predict,

514
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
more than 20 different features,

515
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the accuracy rate,

516
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
is about 80% or more.

517
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Today,

518
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
because it is impossible to introduce so much,

519
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
we will focus on a few,

520
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
core features,

521
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
to introduce to everyone.

522
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
These features,

523
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
these core features,

524
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
in fact,

525
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
we often use,

526
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
to predict other things,

527
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
a core.

528
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Before introducing,

529
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Jessica,

530
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
introduced two protocols,

531
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
two RNA sequencing protocols.

532
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
These two sequencing,

533
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to do annotation,

534
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
is very helpful.

535
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Of course,

536
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
if the audience of biologists,

537
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
if you want to directly use,

538
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
traditional RNA sequencing,

539
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to do analysis,

540
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
there is no problem at all.

541
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's just that we think,

542
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
these two protocols,

543
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
can help to do annotation.

544
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The first one is,

545
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Differential RNA Sequencing,

546
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
called D-RNA-Seq.

547
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
In fact,

548
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the number of applications is also very wide.

549
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Simply put,

550
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
RNA reads,

551
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
it can be divided into two different types.

552
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
One is called Primary Transcript,

553
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
that is,

554
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Triphosphate Binds,

555
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
at the front.

556
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The second is called Processing RNA,

557
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
that is,

558
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it does not have Triphosphate Binding.

559
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What is Primary Transcript?

560
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you look at this picture,

561
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
this red line,

562
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
is actually reads.

563
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That is,

564
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
it is in this,

565
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
will shift the starting value,

566
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
part.

567
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If it is included in the starting value,

568
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
it will have this Triphosphate,

569
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
here.

570
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If not,

571
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
like these,

572
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
these five different,

573
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
these five reads,

574
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
it is the middle part.

575
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
OK.

576
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Then we add an element,

577
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
called Tags.

578
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It will degrade the Processing RNA.

579
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So,

580
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
with no Tag Tree Library,

581
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
its Primary Transcript,

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and Processing RNA,

583
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the ratio will not change.

584
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But in Tag Tree Library,

585
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the whole ratio,

586
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Primary Transcript,

587
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
the ratio will be,

588
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
will be Enriched,

589
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
will be improved.

590
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So when we do RNA Sequencing,

591
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
we compare these two libraries,

592
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we will find that,

593
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
at the starting point,

594
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
this Tag Tree Library,

595
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
will be significantly,

596
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
higher than the Non-Tag Tree Library.

597
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This will allow us,

598
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to quickly determine,

599
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
where is the starting point,

600
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the starting point of the transition.

601
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If we know the starting point of the transition,

602
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
it can help us to determine,

603
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
there will be,

604
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
there may be some genes,

605
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
there may be some UTRs,

606
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
some very important information.

607
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OK.

608
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And this Resolution is very high,

609
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
can go to Single Neutral Type.

610
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The second Protocol is,

611
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
RNA Sequencing with Transcript Fragmentation.

612
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
General RNA Molecule,

613
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
is about what I just said,

614
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
about 200 to 300 Nucleotides.

615
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If we do directly,

616
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
sequencing,

617
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
this situation will often occur,

618
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that is, we will lose,

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
3'N,

620
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
that is, the end of the information.

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What is the reason?

622
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Because our reads,

623
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
as I just said,

624
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the longer the length,

625
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the higher the probability of error,

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
or the higher the accumulation rate.

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
In order to,

628
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
sometimes the error,

629
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
the error ratio reaches a certain level,

630
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
we are very difficult to use these,

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
to help these reads to detect,

632
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it is in,

633
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
which position of the genome.

634
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Because,

635
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
this score,

636
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the score of the mapping is not high.

637
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So, when we are doing the mapping,

638
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
we will do a Quality Trimming,

639
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
is to put these,

640
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
error rate,

641
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
or when doing sequencing,

642
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the quality is relatively poor,

643
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
we cut it off,

644
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
remove it,

645
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and then only use the remaining part,

646
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
to do the sequencing.

647
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Because it was cut off,

648
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
so 3'N information,

649
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
will be lost.

650
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If we do a,

651
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Fragmentation,

652
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
to make this RNA reads shorter,

653
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
usually we will set to 80 to 100.

654
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
At this time,

655
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
it will make this,

656
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
the number of neutrophils that have been sacrificed,

657
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
can be reduced.

658
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That will make us able to,

659
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
detect the whole gene transcription location,

660
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
from the beginning to the end,

661
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
maybe we can detect it.

662
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
This can help us to see,

663
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
which are the real areas,

664
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
this transition,

665
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
where is the transition area.

666
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
OK, those are the two protocols.

667
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
OK,

668
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
to enter this,

669
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
our core feature,

670
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
our most important feature,

671
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
called Transcript Boundary Detection.

672
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Because if we do not know,

673
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
where is the boundary,

674
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
we certainly have no way,

675
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
to easily judge,

676
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
the location of this gene,

677
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
or its length.

678
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So the boundary is very important.

679
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
This is the starting point,

680
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
TSS,

681
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
as we just said,

682
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
if we have the RNA-seq,

683
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
we can easily judge,

684
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
this place.

685
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Then,

686
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
this is more common,

687
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
we often use,

688
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
biological data analysis tool,

689
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
there are three,

690
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
called TSS Predictor,

691
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
TSS-SAR,

692
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
TSS-SAR.

693
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Then we have,

694
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
after comparison,

695
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
found that TSS Predictor,

696
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
is the best,

697
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
the highest accuracy tool.

698
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But the problem is,

699
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
it has a lot of parameters,

700
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and its parameters are very sensitive.

701
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
If we change a little bit,

702
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the whole result,

703
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
will be very different.

704
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So we have to do,

705
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
optimization.

706
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Then,

707
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I will introduce this part,

708
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
below later.

709
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Terminator,

710
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
is the terminal part,

711
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
there is a very common tool,

712
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
called TrenternHP.

713
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
This tool,

714
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but it has a shortcoming,

715
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
that is,

716
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
it only uses,

717
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
genome sequence,

718
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
to do,

719
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
reference sequence,

720
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
to do predictions.

721
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So the accuracy is not too high,

722
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
so we also made some improvements.

723
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Then,

724
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
if,

725
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
our,

726
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
sample,

727
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
in,

728
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
database,

729
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
has stored,

730
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the information of the protein,

731
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
we can directly read.

732
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If not,

733
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
we can use,

734
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
RET,

735
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
this tool,

736
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
it can,

737
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
this,

738
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
use,

739
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
clean source,

740
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and,

741
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
annotation,

742
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
sample,

743
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
or,

744
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
how to say,

745
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
species.

746
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Then,

747
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
we transfer it,

748
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
to our target,

749
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
species.

750
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Then,

751
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
we have,

752
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
this,

753
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
just mentioned,

754
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
fragmentation,

755
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
RNA sequence,

756
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
we can also easily,

757
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
read,

758
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
where is transcript.

759
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Then,

760
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
finally,

761
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
we compare,

762
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
we have starting value,

763
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
we have protein value,

764
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
we have transcript,

765
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
we have terminator,

766
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
naturally,

767
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
then this is,

768
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
simply to see,

769
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
how we can achieve,

770
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Boundary.

771
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Then,

772
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
let's take a closer look at,

773
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
these,

774
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
feature prediction.

775
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The first one is,

776
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
TSS.

777
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I just said,

778
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
TSS,

779
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
is,

780
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
tool,

781
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
is TSS predictor.

782
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Then,

783
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
in order to do,

784
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
parameter optimization,

785
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
we use,

786
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
a machine learning based,

787
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
optimization method,

788
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
called,

789
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Genetic Algorithm.

790
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Genetic Algorithm,

791
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
this is morphology,

792
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I will introduce later.

793
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Simply put,

794
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Genetic Algorithm,

795
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
uses,

796
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
two different,

797
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
changes,

798
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
to achieve,

799
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
the purpose of optimization.

800
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Simply put,

801
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
for example,

802
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
we have,

803
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
today,

804
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
this black line,

805
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
represents,

806
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
all the results,

807
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
that is,

808
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
all of our,

809
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
parameter,

810
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
array combination,

811
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
all the results,

812
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
are just,

813
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
make up this line,

814
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
every point,

815
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
it is a,

816
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
parameter result.

817
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Then,

818
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
the lower part,

819
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
means the worse,

820
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
the performance is worse,

821
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
the higher the performance,

822
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the better.

823
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Then,

824
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
we will,

825
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
randomly choose,

826
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
a point,

827
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
then,

828
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
we may,

829
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
add one,

830
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
then we find,

831
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
oh,

832
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
two results,

833
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
better than one,

834
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
we keep two,

835
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
then we add one,

836
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
find three,

837
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
better than two,

838
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so we keep three,

839
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
this traditional,

840
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
algorithmic method,

841
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
keep doing,

842
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
will do this point,

843
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
right?

844
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Then we add one,

845
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
we will find,

846
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
hey,

847
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the result,

848
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
seems not as good as before,

849
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
we will leave the previous,

850
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
then we will keep doing,

851
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
will find,

852
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
not as good as this,

853
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
this is the best,

854
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
optimized point,

855
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
but we,

856
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
there is another point,

857
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
actually better than it,

858
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
then we,

859
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
so it can not,

860
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
really find,

861
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
optimization,

862
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
what is the optimized part,

863
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
how,

864
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that,

865
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
genetic algorithm,

866
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
what is the concept,

867
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
that is,

868
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
we also,

869
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
randomly take a point,

870
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
but we have a,

871
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
huge change,

872
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
that huge change,

873
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
will randomly,

874
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
run,

875
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
assign parameter,

876
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
so you do not know,

877
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
run to where,

878
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
may run to this point,

879
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
then we find,

880
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
hey,

881
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
better than this,

882
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
then,

883
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
next,

884
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
we adjust a macro,

885
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
add 1,

886
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
we find,

887
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
3,

888
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
better than 2,

889
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
we take 3,

890
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
then add 1,

891
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
add 1,

892
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
add 1,

893
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
naturally,

894
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
we will slowly run here,

895
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
so simply,

896
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that is,

897
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
through this global change,

898
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
we can help us find,

899
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
global optimization,

900
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
that,

901
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
macro adjustment,

902
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
help us find,

903
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
local optimization,

904
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
so that,

905
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
after we combine the two,

906
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
we can find,

907
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
the best,

908
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
optimization method,

909
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
that because,

910
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
TSS predictor,

911
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
too much,

912
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
so,

913
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
we,

914
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
transform a little bit,

915
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
this,

916
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
genetic algorithm,

917
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
that is,

918
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
we have one more step,

919
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
we have a global change,

920
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that is,

921
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we randomly assign,

922
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
all parameters,

923
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
that,

924
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
we do evaluation,

925
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
then,

926
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
we only take a few parameters,

927
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
to change,

928
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the same,

929
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
randomly assign,

930
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
a few,

931
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
not all,

932
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
that,

933
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
will be large change,

934
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
then,

935
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
we do evaluation,

936
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
then,

937
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
we do macro,

938
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
then do evaluation,

939
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
so,

940
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
we will get,

941
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
our optimized parameters,

942
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
OK,

943
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that,

944
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
this is our result,

945
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
we use,

946
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
in three different,

947
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
bacteria,

948
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
bacteria,

949
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
bacteria,

950
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and so on,

951
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
we will find,

952
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
that,

953
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
after optimization,

954
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
the sensitivity,

955
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
are largely,

956
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
have increased,

957
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
especially,

958
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
this,

959
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
we have increased,

960
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
about 30% sensitivity,

961
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
that,

962
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
in the specificity part,

963
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
it is difficult to see,

964
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
what changes,

965
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the main reason,

966
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
is because,

967
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
data sets,

968
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
this,

969
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
this,

970
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
bacteria,

971
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
may have 100,

972
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
nucleic acid,

973
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
but its starting value,

974
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
may be only 1000,

975
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
that is to say,

976
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
there are more than 900,000,

977
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
nucleotide,

978
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
it is actually,

979
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
not the starting value,

980
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
so it is 900,000,

981
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
than 1000,

982
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
this is very,

983
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
unbalanced,

984
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
will lead to,

985
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
its specificity,

986
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
has always been very high,

987
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
because you,

988
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
as long as you,

989
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
always say,

990
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
it is not the starting value,

991
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
it is actually,

992
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
prediction accuracy,

993
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is also very high,

994
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
so,

995
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
this is the problem,

996
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
but,

997
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
the number of,

998
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
golden grape bacteria,

999
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
here,

1000
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
has dropped,

1001
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
about 2000,

1002
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
we can,

1003
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
remove 2000,

1004
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
nucleotide,

1005
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
ok,

1006
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
this is,

1007
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
the starting value part,

1008
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
let's look at,

1009
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
this transcript,

1010
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
is the part of the transition block,

1011
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
because,

1012
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
we have sequencing data,

1013
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
so,

1014
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
we can easily,

1015
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
see,

1016
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
its,

1017
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
gene performance,

1018
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
so,

1019
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
we can set,

1020
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
a cut-off,

1021
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
as long as,

1022
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
higher than this cut-off,

1023
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
we will determine,

1024
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
we will determine,

1025
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
it has performance,

1026
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
so,

1027
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
the reason for the cut-off,

1028
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
is actually,

1029
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
some mapping,

1030
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
it is noise,

1031
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
it is random mapping,

1032
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
so,

1033
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
we do not need to deduct these parts,

1034
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
so,

1035
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
we set a cut-off for it,

1036
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
then,

1037
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
in addition,

1038
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
we also set a tolerance,

1039
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that is,

1040
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
if this performance,

1041
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
has a,

1042
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
temporary,

1043
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
short-term decline,

1044
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we can tolerate,

1045
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
then,

1046
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
we can connect,

1047
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
a few,

1048
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
transcripts,

1049
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
out,

1050
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
then,

1051
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
we can compare,

1052
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
with our genes,

1053
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
because usually,

1054
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
a gene,

1055
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
so,

1056
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
we can use,

1057
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
this gene,

1058
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
information,

1059
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
to help us,

1060
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to connect,

1061
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
this is,

1062
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
we do,

1063
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
this,

1064
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
transcript,

1065
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
block,

1066
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
this,

1067
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
prediction,

1068
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
way,

1069
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
then,

1070
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
finally,

1071
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
talk about,

1072
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
this,

1073
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
terminal,

1074
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
then,

1075
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
actually,

1076
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
terminal,

1077
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
there is,

1078
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
a common tool,

1079
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
called,

1080
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
TrenturnHP,

1081
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
but,

1082
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
we found,

1083
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
when we use,

1084
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
very intuitively,

1085
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
to,

1086
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to judge,

1087
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
if this is,

1088
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
a terminal,

1089
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
point,

1090
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
then,

1091
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
its performance,

1092
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
should be,

1093
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
significantly,

1094
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
down,

1095
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
or end,

1096
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
is no longer,

1097
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
right,

1098
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
so,

1099
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
we went to see,

1100
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
this highest point,

1101
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and the lowest point,

1102
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
it should have,

1103
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
a decreasing,

1104
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
if there is,

1105
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
we say,

1106
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
this is the correct,

1107
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
terminators,

1108
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but,

1109
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the problem is,

1110
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
some,

1111
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
TrenturnHP,

1112
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
it predicts,

1113
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
this terminator,

1114
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
or,

1115
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it is false,

1116
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
or,

1117
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
it is in this,

1118
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
uh,

1119
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
condition,

1120
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
in this sample,

1121
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
it has no effect,

1122
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
or,

1123
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
there is no performance,

1124
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
this,

1125
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
basically,

1126
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
this CDS,

1127
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
has no performance,

1128
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
then,

1129
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
this terminator,

1130
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
naturally,

1131
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
has no function,

1132
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
so,

1133
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
by this way,

1134
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
we can increase,

1135
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
our specificity,

1136
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
then,

1137
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
we can remove,

1138
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
some of the,

1139
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
but,

1140
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
how do we increase,

1141
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
sensitivity,

1142
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
uh,

1143
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
for example,

1144
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
if today,

1145
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
we have two proteins,

1146
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
uh,

1147
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
it,

1148
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
the direction is relative,

1149
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
then,

1150
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
naturally,

1151
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
there should be,

1152
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
a terminal,

1153
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
otherwise,

1154
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
it will be like this,

1155
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
turn,

1156
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
turn,

1157
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
turn,

1158
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
turn,

1159
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
turn,

1160
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
turn,

1161
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
turn,

1162
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
turn,

1163
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
turn,

1164
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
turn,

1165
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
turn,

1166
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
turn,

1167
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
turn,

1168
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
turn,

1169
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
turn,

1170
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
turn,

1171
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
there's hairpin loop,

1172
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
we're talking,

1173
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
about hairpin,

1174
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
so,

1175
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
it has two-level structure,

1176
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
very stable,

1177
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
so,

1178
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
we're going to search,

1179
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
this part,

1180
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
this position,

1181
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
this,

1182
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
the middle of two proteins,

1183
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
do we have,

1184
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
this two-level structure,

1185
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
if yes,

1186
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
then,

1187
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
uh,

1188
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
this,

1189
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
performance,

1190
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
this RNA,

1191
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and sequencing the,

1192
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
this performance,

1193
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and there are these,

1194
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
deterioration pattern,

1195
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
we will judgment,

1196
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
it is a terminator,

1197
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
then,

1198
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
thus,

1199
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
the sensitivity,

1200
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
so,

1201
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
the whole terminator,

1202
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
prediction accuracy,

1203
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
can be mentioned,

1204
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
about 80% or so,

1205
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
good,

1206
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
then,

1207
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
this is our,

1208
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
a real example,

1209
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
this is,

1210
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
uh,

1211
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
a golden grape ball,

1212
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
an example,

1213
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
you can see,

1214
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the red,

1215
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
this histogram,

1216
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
it is,

1217
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
we're talking about,

1218
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
fragmentation RNA-seq,

1219
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
you can see,

1220
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
it covers,

1221
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
the whole transcript,

1222
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
can cover,

1223
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
this block,

1224
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
then,

1225
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
general RNA sequencing,

1226
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
this is differential RNA sequencing,

1227
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
you can see,

1228
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
this information,

1229
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
good,

1230
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
then,

1231
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
we just talked about,

1232
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
this dRNA-seq,

1233
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
through this text tree,

1234
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and non-text tree comparison,

1235
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
we can know,

1236
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
TSS,

1237
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
uh,

1238
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
where is the starting point,

1239
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
you can see,

1240
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
obviously,

1241
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
there is a text tree library,

1242
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
obviously,

1243
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
higher than non-text tree library,

1244
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
so,

1245
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
this is a TSS,

1246
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
here,

1247
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
then,

1248
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
we use,

1249
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
terminator prediction,

1250
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
we find TSS,

1251
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
terminator is here,

1252
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
then,

1253
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
CDS,

1254
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
protein is here,

1255
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
then,

1256
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
naturally,

1257
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
then,

1258
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
with this feature,

1259
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
we can,

1260
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
extend,

1261
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
to predict more things,

1262
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
for example,

1263
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
we can predict,

1264
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
where is the transition,

1265
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
where is the operon,

1266
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
you can see,

1267
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
for example,

1268
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
this example,

1269
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
there is a transcript,

1270
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
there is a whole transition block,

1271
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
then,

1272
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
there are two proteins in this block,

1273
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
meaning,

1274
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
these two proteins,

1275
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
they are together,

1276
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
transferred and transferred,

1277
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
so,

1278
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
these two proteins,

1279
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
it is possible,

1280
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
they are related in public use,

1281
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
then,

1282
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
we can also find promoter,

1283
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
then,

1284
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
promoter,

1285
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
it will accelerate,

1286
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
or promote,

1287
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
this,

1288
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
we do the transition,

1289
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
this,

1290
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
this,

1291
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
process,

1292
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
so,

1293
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
usually,

1294
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
it is in TSS,

1295
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
which is the front of the starting point,

1296
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
about 35 to 50,

1297
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
this nucleic acid,

1298
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
this position,

1299
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
so,

1300
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
when we,

1301
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
we already have TSS information,

1302
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
naturally,

1303
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
we can extract,

1304
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
extract the front,

1305
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
or extract the front,

1306
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
these sequences,

1307
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
then,

1308
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
we do,

1309
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
this,

1310
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
this promoter,

1311
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
analysis,

1312
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
then,

1313
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
we can find,

1314
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
oh,

1315
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
indeed,

1316
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it has a very specific,

1317
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
sequence,

1318
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
code,

1319
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
TA,

1320
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
TAAT,

1321
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
this,

1322
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
in bacteria,

1323
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we call it pre-know box,

1324
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
it is a promoter,

1325
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
ok,

1326
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
good,

1327
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
now,

1328
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
we have,

1329
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
this,

1330
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
transcript boundary,

1331
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
then,

1332
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
sometimes,

1333
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
it is very interesting,

1334
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
that is,

1335
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
what we just said at the beginning,

1336
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
sometimes,

1337
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
we will find,

1338
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
it has a very high expression block,

1339
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
but,

1340
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
it is not a protein,

1341
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
so,

1342
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
this is a very common,

1343
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
a topic,

1344
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
called non-coding RNA,

1345
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
no matter in which field,

1346
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
you do nucleation,

1347
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
you do,

1348
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
cell,

1349
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
bacteria,

1350
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
will,

1351
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
will be involved,

1352
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
will want to do this,

1353
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
what is non-coding RNA,

1354
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
that is,

1355
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
we just said,

1356
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
traditional,

1357
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
in fact,

1358
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
it should be DNA,

1359
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
into RNA,

1360
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
RNA into protein,

1361
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
but,

1362
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
there is,

1363
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
there is a special case,

1364
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that is,

1365
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
DNA into,

1366
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
into RNA,

1367
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
it will produce,

1368
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
a very interesting,

1369
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
secondary structure,

1370
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
that is,

1371
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
it can interact,

1372
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
it can interact with,

1373
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
with this RNA,

1374
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
it can control,

1375
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
a lot of different things,

1376
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
you can see,

1377
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
in,

1378
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
in this bacteria,

1379
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
in the research of,

1380
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Sermal RNA,

1381
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
from 2000 to,

1382
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
2000,

1383
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
2016,

1384
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
this publication,

1385
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
the number,

1386
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
is an increase in the number,

1387
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
say,

1388
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
it is a very important,

1389
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
topic,

1390
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
so,

1391
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
we use,

1392
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
analgesic,

1393
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
you can also read,

1394
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
non-coding RNA,

1395
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
how to do it,

1396
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
because,

1397
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
non-coding RNA,

1398
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
in it,

1399
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
there is a type,

1400
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
this type,

1401
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
we can use an example later,

1402
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
very simple,

1403
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
let everyone see,

1404
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
that simply speaking,

1405
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
that is,

1406
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
intergenic,

1407
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the,

1408
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
the position,

1409
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that is,

1410
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
it is like an island,

1411
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
not with any protein,

1412
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
there is a connection,

1413
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
that this,

1414
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
if this part,

1415
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
we can,

1416
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
directly judge,

1417
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
it is very likely to be Sermal RNA,

1418
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
of course,

1419
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
we will look at its length,

1420
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Sermal RNA length,

1421
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
usually,

1422
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
within 300 to 500 nucleotides,

1423
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
so,

1424
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
if it does not have any,

1425
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
with protein,

1426
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
any contact,

1427
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
high,

1428
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
high expression,

1429
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and then there is the starting value,

1430
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
the length,

1431
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
again,

1432
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
less than 300 to 500,

1433
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
then we can directly judge,

1434
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
it is very likely to be,

1435
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Sermal RNA,

1436
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
non-coding RNA,

1437
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
if its distance is too long,

1438
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
we will go to see,

1439
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
is there a part of the part,

1440
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
a,

1441
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
a,

1442
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
a point,

1443
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
is that it has this,

1444
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
obvious,

1445
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
large magnitude,

1446
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
expression of the decline,

1447
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
if there is,

1448
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
it is very likely,

1449
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
this paragraph,

1450
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
is that we did not predict,

1451
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
the Terminator,

1452
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
so,

1453
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
here may be,

1454
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Sermal RNA,

1455
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
or is there,

1456
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
is there a possibility,

1457
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
it is a process inside,

1458
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that is,

1459
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
process inside,

1460
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that is,

1461
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
it has enzyme,

1462
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
it will cut the gene,

1463
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
let it,

1464
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
this paragraph,

1465
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that is,

1466
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
take it to do,

1467
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
do prediction,

1468
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that is,

1469
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
it will cut this paragraph,

1470
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and then this paragraph,

1471
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
becomes a functional Sermal RNA,

1472
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
if this situation,

1473
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
we also think,

1474
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
it is possible,

1475
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
that another location,

1476
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
is in UTR-derived,

1477
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that is,

1478
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
it will,

1479
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
it will be with protein,

1480
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
together,

1481
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
transition,

1482
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
sorry,

1483
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
but it will not transition,

1484
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
into the protein area,

1485
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that is,

1486
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
at the end of the part,

1487
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
if it has TSS,

1488
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
that is,

1489
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
already to the end,

1490
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
obviously to the end,

1491
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
but it has a start value,

1492
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
or it has a process inside,

1493
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
will cut it,

1494
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that it is very likely,

1495
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
in fact,

1496
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
it is Sermal RNA,

1497
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
at the end,

1498
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
that is,

1499
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
if it has a start value,

1500
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that end,

1501
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
in,

1502
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to reach,

1503
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
protein time,

1504
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
it has a process inside,

1505
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
here,

1506
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
or it has an expression,

1507
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
a significant decline,

1508
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
we also think,

1509
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
it may be Sermal RNA,

1510
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
the other is,

1511
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Interstitial,

1512
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that is,

1513
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
it is two proteins,

1514
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
transition,

1515
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
as mentioned earlier,

1516
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
it is a transition together,

1517
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
two proteins,

1518
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and then in the middle,

1519
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
this block,

1520
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
with 5'-LUT is very similar,

1521
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
if it has a start value,

1522
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
because there is a process inside associate,

1523
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
or its end,

1524
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
it has a significant decline,

1525
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
that it may also be Sermal RNA,

1526
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
good,

1527
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
let's take a look,

1528
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
this,

1529
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
our algorithm,

1530
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
will not work,

1531
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
so we apply it,

1532
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
in several,

1533
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
uh,

1534
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
uh,

1535
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
strands,

1536
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
several proteins,

1537
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
first of all,

1538
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
this is a,

1539
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Intergenic Sermal RNA,

1540
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
you can pay attention to see,

1541
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
in this,

1542
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
uh,

1543
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
uh,

1544
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
transcript is very obvious,

1545
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
high expression,

1546
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
then there is TSS,

1547
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that is,

1548
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
start value here,

1549
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
then we go to take this sequence,

1550
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
we go to the data base to compare,

1551
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
it is a known Sermal RNA,

1552
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
that we can not only find the known,

1553
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
we can find some unknown,

1554
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
some novel,

1555
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
for example,

1556
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
here,

1557
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
it is the same expression,

1558
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
that is,

1559
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
there is TSS here,

1560
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
it has not been reported,

1561
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
it is Sermal RNA,

1562
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but it is obvious,

1563
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
if it has expression,

1564
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
there must be something there,

1565
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
so it is very likely,

1566
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
it is not found,

1567
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Sermal RNA,

1568
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
that is,

1569
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
in 5'UTR,

1570
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you can see,

1571
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
about the front part,

1572
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
it is a transition,

1573
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
here,

1574
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
protein here,

1575
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that front un-transition block,

1576
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
there is a very extreme,

1577
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
high expression,

1578
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
block,

1579
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
then we go to cut it to see,

1580
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
then here,

1581
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
there is a very fast decline,

1582
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
we go to cut it to see,

1583
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
found that it is,

1584
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
a known Sermal RNA,

1585
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
that is,

1586
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
3'N,

1587
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
has reached the end,

1588
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
there is a very high expression,

1589
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
then we go to see,

1590
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
it is also a known Sermal RNA,

1591
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
that is,

1592
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
inter-CDS,

1593
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
these two CDS,

1594
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
it is a transition,

1595
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
you can see,

1596
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
it is a transition,

1597
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
in the middle part,

1598
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
there is a sudden high expression,

1599
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
there is also a TSS,

1600
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
then we go to see,

1601
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
it is also a known Sermal RNA,

1602
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
that is,

1603
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
antisense,

1604
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I just did not talk about antisense,

1605
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
basically,

1606
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
it is in a direction,

1607
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
there is protein,

1608
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
for example,

1609
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
it is in this direction,

1610
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
from right to left,

1611
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
this direction of the transition,

1612
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
it is going down,

1613
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
it means it is in this direction,

1614
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
then it is a protein,

1615
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but in its relative direction,

1616
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
from left to right,

1617
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
it also has a block is expressed,

1618
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
they are overlapping,

1619
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
then we go to see,

1620
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
found that here,

1621
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
in fact,

1622
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it is also a Sermal RNA,

1623
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
then we call it antisense,

1624
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Sermal RNA,

1625
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
that is,

1626
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
it is different from the protein in the direction,

1627
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
overlap each other,

1628
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
OK,

1629
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
then,

1630
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
since we have seen these cases,

1631
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
we want to know,

1632
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
what is the accuracy rate?

1633
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So,

1634
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
we went to compare four different bacteria,

1635
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
they all already have a known Sermal RNA list,

1636
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
then we go to predict,

1637
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
we found that our detection rate,

1638
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
probably up to 80%,

1639
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
according to different species,

1640
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
different percentages,

1641
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but 80% to 90%,

1642
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
we can detect all of them,

1643
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
known Sermal RNA,

1644
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
that is,

1645
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
there is no problem,

1646
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that unknown,

1647
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
we will not have a lot of mutations?

1648
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So,

1649
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
we have a cooperation with NIH,

1650
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
then they use our tool to analyze,

1651
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Bordetella pertussis,

1652
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
is also a bacteria,

1653
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
then he found 15,

1654
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
they think it is possible,

1655
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Sermal RNA candidate,

1656
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
some of which,

1657
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
they think it is possible,

1658
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
but,

1659
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Energetic did not predict,

1660
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
if you see the ID,

1661
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Energetic ID,

1662
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
we have predicted,

1663
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
that is not,

1664
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
we do not think it,

1665
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Energetic,

1666
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
do not think it is,

1667
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
that result,

1668
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
that is,

1669
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
there are about 10,

1670
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
is the correct prediction,

1671
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that is,

1672
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
really is Sermal RNA,

1673
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
or really is not Sermal RNA,

1674
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so,

1675
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
there is about 70% accuracy,

1676
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
that we simply introduce a case,

1677
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
we think,

1678
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
we all think very interesting case,

1679
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
that this is,

1680
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
two proteins here,

1681
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
in the middle,

1682
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
there is a very high expression of Sermal RNA,

1683
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
we predict it is Sermal RNA,

1684
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
OK,

1685
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
its length is about 67 nucleotides,

1686
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
is 67 nucleotide length,

1687
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
then,

1688
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
we know that this is very interesting,

1689
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Maxine fat burning,

1690
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
it is known to suppress,

1691
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the expression of the cause of the disease,

1692
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
so,

1693
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
if we do not add Maxine fat burning,

1694
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
you will find that this Sermal RNA exists,

1695
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
67,

1696
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
there is a very strong signal,

1697
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
that is,

1698
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
this Sermal RNA really exists,

1699
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it really will function,

1700
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
but,

1701
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
if we add Maxine fat burning,

1702
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
because the cause of the disease was reduced,

1703
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
you will find that the expression of this Sermal RNA is also reduced,

1704
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
it is said that this Sermal RNA,

1705
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
it is related to the disease,

1706
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
OK,

1707
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
then,

1708
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the study has found that,

1709
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
BVG-AS,

1710
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
it is two,

1711
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
called two-component system,

1712
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
they will interact,

1713
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
then,

1714
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
how to say,

1715
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
will promote the expression of the cause of the disease,

1716
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
when we,

1717
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
if we go to mutate,

1718
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
this BVG-AS,

1719
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you will find that,

1720
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
no matter if you add Maxine fat burning,

1721
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
this,

1722
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Sermal RNA,

1723
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
its expression is reduced,

1724
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that is to say,

1725
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
this Sermal RNA,

1726
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
it will also be,

1727
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
this,

1728
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
BVG-AS,

1729
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
two-component system,

1730
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
control,

1731
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
in addition,

1732
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
there is a thing called,

1733
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
HFQ,

1734
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
it is a global,

1735
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Sermal RNA binding chaperone,

1736
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
that is,

1737
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
it will be with many,

1738
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
different Sermal RNA,

1739
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
do the interaction,

1740
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that,

1741
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
the purpose is to help these Sermal RNA,

1742
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
to,

1743
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
find,

1744
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
to,

1745
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
its target,

1746
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
above,

1747
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
so,

1748
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
when this HFQ,

1749
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
when this HFQ,

1750
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
is mutated,

1751
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
you will find,

1752
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Sermal RNA,

1753
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
reduced more,

1754
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
so,

1755
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
here,

1756
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
it is very simple,

1757
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
to launch a,

1758
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
hypothesis,

1759
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
that is,

1760
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
this Sermal RNA,

1761
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it is related to the cause of the disease,

1762
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
it will do the interaction with HFQ,

1763
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
to find its target,

1764
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
to,

1765
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
target gene,

1766
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
that,

1767
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
it will also be,

1768
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
BVG-AS,

1769
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
control,

1770
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
so,

1771
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
from here,

1772
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
we can see that,

1773
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
in fact,

1774
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
analgesic,

1775
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
we have predicted,

1776
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
novel Sermal RNA,

1777
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
with a certain accuracy rate,

1778
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
good,

1779
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
in addition to Sermal RNA,

1780
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
we can also,

1781
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
as we just said,

1782
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
predict 20,

1783
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
20 different genomic features,

1784
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
so,

1785
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
we will compare,

1786
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
each different,

1787
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
feature,

1788
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
their database,

1789
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
that,

1790
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
most of the database,

1791
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
it has Ecoline,

1792
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
large-sensitivity data,

1793
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
so,

1794
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
we use large-sensitivity to do,

1795
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
that,

1796
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
we have differential RNA sequencing,

1797
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
or,

1798
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
we only use traditional RNA-seq,

1799
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that,

1800
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
most of the accuracy rate,

1801
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
can reach about 80%,

1802
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the prediction accuracy rate,

1803
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
but,

1804
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
there are two,

1805
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
very special,

1806
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
one is called TSS,

1807
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
which is the starting value,

1808
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
one is Promoter,

1809
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
one is only 6%,

1810
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
one is 39%,

1811
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
but, of course,

1812
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
we can also understand,

1813
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
because Promoter and TSS,

1814
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
are related,

1815
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Promoter is usually,

1816
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
on the top of TSS,

1817
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
35 to 50,

1818
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
nucleotide length,

1819
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
so,

1820
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
TSS is not good,

1821
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Promoter,

1822
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
of course,

1823
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
will not be good,

1824
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
so,

1825
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
why not,

1826
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
we will see,

1827
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that,

1828
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
this is,

1829
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
in Public Database,

1830
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
RegulonDB,

1831
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
three,

1832
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
RNA sequencing data,

1833
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
they,

1834
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
then,

1835
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
you will find,

1836
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
they have,

1837
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
very large,

1838
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
sequence,

1839
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
only 43,

1840
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
starting value,

1841
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
they are,

1842
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
can be found,

1843
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
that,

1844
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
there are many,

1845
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
most of them,

1846
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
they are self-evident,

1847
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
there is no overlap,

1848
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
then,

1849
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
we suspect,

1850
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
this data,

1851
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
there should be a problem,

1852
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
because,

1853
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
they are all Ecoline,

1854
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
how can the difference be so big,

1855
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
so,

1856
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
we want to say,

1857
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
then,

1858
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
we put,

1859
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
all,

1860
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
these three,

1861
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Database,

1862
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
plus,

1863
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
these data,

1864
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
these TSS data,

1865
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
we all go forward,

1866
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
to find Promoter,

1867
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
see if we can find Promoter,

1868
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the result,

1869
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
is like this,

1870
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
these three,

1871
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Database,

1872
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Dataset,

1873
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
they have no way,

1874
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
to find,

1875
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
the existence of Promoter,

1876
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
but,

1877
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
in Energetic,

1878
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
80% of TSS,

1879
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
can find,

1880
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
with this Promoter,

1881
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Association,

1882
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
so,

1883
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
we can know,

1884
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
these three,

1885
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Public,

1886
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
these three,

1887
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Public Dataset,

1888
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
actually,

1889
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
there is a problem,

1890
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
then,

1891
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Energetic,

1892
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
it is actually,

1893
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
accuracy,

1894
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
in providing,

1895
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Annotation,

1896
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
it is a,

1897
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
high-quality,

1898
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Annotation,

1899
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
OK,

1900
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
then,

1901
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I want,

1902
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to introduce here,

1903
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
then,

1904
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
other Features,

1905
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
if you are interested,

1906
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
we can discuss,

1907
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
we can discuss,

1908
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
no problem,

1909
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
then,

1910
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
finally,

1911
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I want to,

1912
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
give you a little,

1913
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
report,

1914
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
give you a little,

1915
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
advertising,

1916
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
welcome everyone to use,

1917
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
basically,

1918
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
it is like this,

1919
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
this,

1920
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
our,

1921
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Energetic,

1922
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
has been,

1923
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
integrated,

1924
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
to NIH,

1925
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
biological information,

1926
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
list,

1927
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
inside,

1928
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
so,

1929
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
NIH,

1930
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
can also be very free,

1931
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
they are also very,

1932
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
often use our tool,

1933
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
then,

1934
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
the second is,

1935
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
LabOne,

1936
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
it is a,

1937
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
organization,

1938
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
it will collect,

1939
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
various,

1940
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
different,

1941
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
biological information,

1942
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
software,

1943
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
they are,

1944
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
when they collect,

1945
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
software,

1946
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
they will do,

1947
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
voting,

1948
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
will let this,

1949
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
they can vote,

1950
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
they feel better,

1951
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
then,

1952
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
we were,

1953
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
recorded that week,

1954
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
voting,

1955
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
we are,

1956
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
top three,

1957
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
position,

1958
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
then,

1959
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
the other Energetic,

1960
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
was also reported,

1961
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
by RNA-seq blog,

1962
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
then,

1963
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
when we have preprinted,

1964
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
we will be reported,

1965
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
to RNA-seq blog,

1966
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that blog,

1967
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
is also a lot of people,

1968
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
in addition,

1969
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
we are now,

1970
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
this Energetic,

1971
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
has been applied to,

1972
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
very,

1973
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
very,

1974
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
different,

1975
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
very,

1976
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
different,

1977
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
bacteria,

1978
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
so,

1979
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
a lot of,

1980
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
published,

1981
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
paper,

1982
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
then,

1983
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
some,

1984
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
tools,

1985
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
also started to use,

1986
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
our tools,

1987
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
as a,

1988
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
standard,

1989
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
because we are,

1990
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
the first tool,

1991
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
to use RNA-seq,

1992
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
to do,

1993
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
non-coding RNA,

1994
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
prediction,

1995
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
so,

1996
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
they also started,

1997
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
to integrate,

1998
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
these Energetic,

1999
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
tools,

2000
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
or compare,

2001
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
our tools,

2002
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
then,

2003
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
recently,

2004
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
a lot of,

2005
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
papers,

2006
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
have been published,

2007
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
so,

2008
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I will,

2009
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I will also,

2010
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
reply,

2011
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
if I have a bug,

2012
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
welcome to tell me,

2013
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
then I can also,

2014
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
correct,

2015
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
so,

2016
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
this is,

2017
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
our GitHub,

2018
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
basically,

2019
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Energetic,

2020
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
is stored here,

2021
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
it is an open source,

2022
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
everyone can,

2023
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
use at will,

2024
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
you want to modify,

2025
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
or how,

2026
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
there is no problem,

2027
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
if there is any problem,

2028
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
this issue,

2029
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
you can also open,

2030
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
then I can also,

2031
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
go to see,

2032
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
to upgrade,

2033
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
OK,

2034
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
good,

2035
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
finally,

2036
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Energetic,

2037
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
is the first,

2038
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
modular,

2039
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and systematic,

2040
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
RNA-seq-based tool,

2041
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
to do,

2042
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
genome annotations,

2043
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
mainly for,

2044
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
bacteria and archaea,

2045
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
then we compare,

2046
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
a lot of different tools,

2047
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
then we integrate,

2048
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the best one,

2049
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
then,

2050
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
we also create,

2051
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
then improve,

2052
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
these methods,

2053
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
we not only integrate,

2054
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
we also improve,

2055
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
then we can,

2056
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
systematically,

2057
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
to compare,

2058
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
to detect,

2059
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
many different,

2060
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
genomic features,

2061
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
then we also,

2062
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
optimize,

2063
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
necessary to optimize,

2064
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
these parameters,

2065
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
so,

2066
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
users can freely,

2067
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
to use,

2068
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
to do,

2069
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
you want to do,

2070
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
feature detection,

2071
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
then we provide,

2072
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
statistics,

2073
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and visualization,

2074
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
for your reference,

2075
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
OK,

2076
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
finally,

2077
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
is to give you a,

2078
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
high-quality annotations,

2079
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
then,

2080
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
in the future,

2081
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
we hope to continue,

2082
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
is,

2083
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
to use deep learning,

2084
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
to improve,

2085
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
our predictions,

2086
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
deep learning,

2087
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
it is a,

2088
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
up-to-date,

2089
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
machine learning method,

2090
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
then the other is,

2091
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
we also hope,

2092
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
to integrate more,

2093
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
RNA-seq protocol data,

2094
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
to help us,

2095
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
improve,

2096
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
our prediction accuracy,

2097
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
we also hope,

2098
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
to extend,

2099
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
our function,

2100
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
to,

2101
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
virus,

2102
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and,

2103
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
biological research,

2104
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
above,

2105
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that,

2106
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
finally,

2107
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
thank you,

2108
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
my,

2109
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
this is my,

2110
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
subject,

2111
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
although,

2112
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I have left,

2113
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
for a while,

2114
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
but,

2115
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
this,

2116
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
we have been updating,

2117
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
that,

2118
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
this is my,

2119
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
boss,

2120
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
then his,

2121
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
people below,

2122
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
help me,

2123
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
experiment data,

2124
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
that,

2125
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
this is our,

2126
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
bioinformatics team,

2127
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
that,

2128
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
NIH,

2129
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
help us,

2130
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
experiment,

2131
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
cooperation subject,

2132
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
that,

2133
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
this is my boss now,

2134
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
although,

2135
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I have jumped to,

2136
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
proteomics,

2137
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
and,

2138
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
multiomics,

2139
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and,

2140
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
single cell,

2141
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
less touch,

2142
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
RNA-seq,

2143
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
this,

2144
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
bacteria,

2145
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
RNA-seq part,

2146
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but,

2147
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
he still,

2148
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
give us a lot of freedom,

2149
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
can go,

2150
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
maintain,

2151
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
my tool,

2152
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
probably,

2153
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
that,

2154
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
if there are any questions,

2155
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I am very,

2156
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
welcome,

2157
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
then,

2158
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
we can discuss together,

2159
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
thank you.

2160
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
OK,

2161
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
thank you,

2162
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Songpan,

2163
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
help us do such a wonderful speech,

2164
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
OK,

2165
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
now,

2166
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
audience,

2167
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
is there anyone who has any questions,

2168
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
you can turn on your microphone,

2169
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
then,

2170
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
ask questions,

2171
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
OK,

2172
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
if not,

2173
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I will,

2174
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
have,

2175
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
OK,

2176
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
hello,

2177
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I am,

2178
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
British,

2179
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Bristol University,

2180
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
first time,

2181
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
to attend,

2182
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
this conference,

2183
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
thank you,

2184
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
have you heard,

2185
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
yes,

2186
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
yes,

2187
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
yes,

2188
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
thank you,

2189
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
one question,

2190
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
you mentioned,

2191
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
that,

2192
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
there is a,

2193
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
TSS optimization,

2194
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
that is,

2195
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
parameter adjustment,

2196
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
that,

2197
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
myself,

2198
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
recently,

2199
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
was taught by the boss,

2200
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
to analyze,

2201
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
proteomics,

2202
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that adjustment,

2203
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
refers to,

2204
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
comparing,

2205
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
the RNA sequencing,

2206
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
with

2207
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
the Z-score,

2208
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
how do you,

2209
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
how do you say,

2210
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
that part is,

2211
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
relatively,

2212
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
not so,

2213
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
complicated,

2214
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
because,

2215
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
we are,

2216
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
our,

2217
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
we are,

2218
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
the WebLab,

2219
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
members,

2220
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
they are,

2221
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
seriously,

2222
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
to really

2223
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
use the meat of the body,

2224
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
to compare,

2225
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
this,

2226
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
RNA sequencing of data,

2227
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
so they are very certain,

2228
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
to find out the meat,

2229
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
after the comparison,

2230
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
set,

2231
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
so these sets,

2232
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
is our Golden Standard,

2233
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
so I'm going to compare,

2234
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
this set,

2235
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
and then calculate,

2236
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
sensitivity,

2237
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and specificity,

2238
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
right,

2239
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
so,

2240
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I did not use,

2241
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
P-value,

2242
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
this thing,

2243
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
right,

2244
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
but,

2245
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
if you are doing,

2246
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
proteomics,

2247
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
then,

2248
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
it is possible,

2249
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
you need to compare,

2250
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
P-value,

2251
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
but,

2252
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
how to do this in detail,

2253
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
we may,

2254
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
need to know,

2255
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
ah,

2256
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the purpose of your research,

2257
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and,

2258
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
optimization,

2259
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
or,

2260
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
you can do this,

2261
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
so,

2262
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
you need to know,

2263
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
how to do this,

2264
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
to determine,

2265
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
this,

2266
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
right,

2267
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
thank you.

2268
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Okay,

2269
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
so I have a question,

2270
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
which is,

2271
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
thank you for providing,

2272
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
this,

2273
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
this,

2274
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
this,

2275
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
this,

2276
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
this,

2277
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
this,

2278
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
this,

2279
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
this,

2280
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
this,

2281
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
this,

2282
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
this,

2283
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
this,

2284
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
this,

2285
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
this,

2286
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
this,

2287
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
this,

2288
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
this,

2289
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
this,

2290
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
this,

2291
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
this,

2292
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
this,

2293
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
this,

2294
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
this,

2295
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
this,

2296
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
this,

2297
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
this,

2298
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
this,

2299
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
this,

2300
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
this,

2301
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
this,

2302
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
this,

2303
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
this,

2304
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
this,

2305
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
and this.

2306
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So,

2307
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
the question I want to ask you is,

2308
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
about your research,

2309
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I did,

2310
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
some solar star system complexes,

2311
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
what are the general characteristics of this solar star system,

2312
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
and how do you determine

2313
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
the individual characteristics,

2314
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
for example,

2315
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
we have different,

2316
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
uh,

2317
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
patients,

2318
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
their,

2319
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
for example,

2320
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
we want to know,

2321
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
we want to know,

2322
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
does it change the pathology of the pathology,

2323
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
that this thing,

2324
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
for,

2325
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
for annotation,

2326
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
the requirements are relatively low,

2327
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
so they will usually,

2328
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
usually go to see the pathology of the change,

2329
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
to do statistics analysis,

2330
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
right,

2331
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
but he,

2332
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
this method,

2333
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
he can study some of these pathologies,

2334
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
that is,

2335
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
the performance of RNN,

2336
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
uh,

2337
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
polygons,

2338
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
or,

2339
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
does he have any RNA performance?

2340
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Can you use this tool?

2341
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
There may be no way,

2342
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
because if you want to do,

2343
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
look at the performance of RNA,

2344
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
in fact,

2345
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
we do,

2346
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
simply do mapping,

2347
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
we can get this,

2348
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
uh,

2349
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
that is,

2350
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
we generally talk about this,

2351
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
we just said,

2352
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
at the beginning of this histogram part,

2353
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
that is,

2354
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
you can get,

2355
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
you can get this thing,

2356
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
that,

2357
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
usually we do,

2358
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
will not do,

2359
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
there is a need to see,

2360
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
non-coding RNA,

2361
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
UTRR,

2362
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and so on,

2363
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
less,

2364
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
but of course,

2365
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
if they,

2366
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
someone wants to use,

2367
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
there is no problem,

2368
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
it can also be done,

2369
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
it can also be analyzed,

2370
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
absolutely no problem,

2371
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
can be used,

2372
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
just that I am,

2373
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I am just less,

2374
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
almost did not see anyone,

2375
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
will do,

2376
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
to do,

2377
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
want to go to see,

2378
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
non-coding RNA,

2379
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
or go to see,

2380
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
this UTRR,

2381
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
or look at the binding type,

2382
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
and so on,

2383
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
less,

2384
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
usually go,

2385
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
directly to see,

2386
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
UTRR,

2387
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
will be more,

2388
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
understand,

2389
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
good,

2390
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
thank you,

2391
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
that,

2392
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
there are people,

2393
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
any questions?

2394
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
OK,

2395
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
if not,

2396
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
then we thank,

2397
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Songwan today,

2398
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
to give us this speech,

2399
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
that we look forward to next time,

2400
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
if you still have a chance,

2401
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
can come again,

2402
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Taiwan,

2403
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
update the latest research,

2404
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
thank you,

2405
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
thank you,

2406
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
thank you,
