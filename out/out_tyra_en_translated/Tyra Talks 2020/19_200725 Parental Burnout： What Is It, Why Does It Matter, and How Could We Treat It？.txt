Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's presentation by Project Tara.
I'm your host, Suyi An.
First of all, I'd like to thank our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,
for being our speaker today.
I'm also very happy to have people from all cities
and towns join us in this online academic presentation.
I'm going to spend a minute or two to introduce our speaker, Lin Gaoxue,
and then I'm going to talk a little bit about today's event.
I'm really happy that Gaoxue can be our speaker today.
Gaoxue and I met in NTU.
Gaoxue's background is very, very special.
Gaoxue graduated from NTU's Department of Chemistry,
so she didn't major in psychology.
Later, she studied at NTU's Psychological Institute,
which is a laboratory in the field of development.
She had a very special experience.
After Gaoxue studied at the Psychological Institute,
she didn't give up her original chemistry major.
Instead, she studied at NTU's Counseling Center.
After graduation, she even became a full-time high school chemistry teacher.
Gaoxue is currently studying in the Ph.D. class of the Catholic University of Belize.
As far as I know, she also studies in the field of psychological development.
When I was preparing for this presentation, I was actually quite nervous.
Because Gaoxue herself sent me a very rich CV.
At first glance, I thought she was a god.
Gaoxue, if I say something wrong, you can correct me at any time.
I was thinking about what to prepare.
The information is too rich.
Gaoxue has won many research-related awards,
including the Best Dictionary and Dictionary Award
at the Taiwan Psychological Institute,
as well as the Young Scholar Award
at the Taiwan Women's Studies Institute, etc.
I can't wait to be awarded.
Today, Gaoxue will mainly share with us
her speech on the topic of gender equality.
After all, I'm not an expert,
so I'll leave it to Gaoxue to explain it to us later.
But I think this topic, especially recently,
is particularly in line with the current situation.
During COVID-19, Taiwan may not be very obvious,
but abroad, there are indeed quite a lot of people
who are concerned about gender equality.
Many parents and children
may be stuck at home all day long
due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
So I'm really looking forward to Gaoxue's speech.

This is Gaoxue's brief introduction.
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.
Gaoxue can add her own self-introduction later.
So the format we're going to do today is
after I'm done with my presentation,
Gaoxue will start a one-hour speech.
Then there will be Q&A.
But the format of Project Hera is quite casual.
So if you have any questions,
you can just turn on your microphone and ask.
Or if you're a little shy,
you can leave a comment in the chat.
Or I may also collect them into the last Q&A.
Or I may also collect them into the last Q&A.
That's all for my introduction.
Gaoxue, I'll leave the rest to you.

Thank you, Annie, for the kind introduction.

But the training mode is mainly in Dutch and French.
After introducing our school,
let me introduce myself first.
Thank you very much for the introduction of Yi-An.
I have been in Taiwan University
from the university to the master's class for eight years.
At the university,
my major is chemistry,
and my minor is psychology.
At the master's class,
I completed my master's thesis
under the guidance of
the Department of Psychology.
My specialization in research
is the development of psychology
in general psychology.
In 2019,
as I just said,
I joined the Catholic University of Taiwan
to study for my doctorate degree.
My specialization in research is still developing psychology.
At the same time,
I also joined the two subfields of
cultural psychology and health psychology.
In the process,
as mentioned by Yi-An just now,
I used to be a full-time
chemistry intern
at Songshan High School in Taipei City.
I also served as a full-time research assistant
at the laboratory of Professor Cao Zhengcao
of the Department of Communication and Technology at the University of Taiwan.
Because of this more diverse
or different experience,
I am particularly interested in
the related emotional experiences
in my family.
Especially,
what I care about is a social culture.
I am particularly interested in the influence of
individuals and parents
in this social culture.
Some of my research themes
include parenting stress,
and emotional regulation
of how parents
deal with their emotions related to stress.
I particularly use
physiological indicators
to measure the stress of an individual.
I will use cultural perspective
or the network analysis
commonly used in communication psychology
to care about the relationship
between people
and the different phenomena
in people's minds.
At the beginning of the report,
I also introduced
my field,
the field of developmental psychology.
I referred to
the introduction made by
my master's class teacher,
Prof. Lei Ganlin,
in the online course of Coursera.
From his point of view,
before we get to know
the development of psychology,
we may need to understand
what psychology is.
Psychology cares about
the knowledge of people and their minds.
It also includes
the field of experimental psychology.
In this field,
we may want to care about
a person's cognitive,
our cognition,
our emotions,
our language,
and even our intuition.
We also include
social and personality psychology.
In this field,
we care about a person's personality,
the interaction between a person
and another person,
and social psychology.
This is a special cultural phenomenon
in a cultural community.
We care about the similarity
and interdependence
between different cultures.
Of course,
applied psychology is also
a major field in psychology.
For example,
criminal psychology,
which I mentioned before,
also includes
the interaction between
clinical psychologists
and our cases.
These are the topics
of clinical psychology.
Even in our educational field
or organizational field,
there are many topics
discussed in psychology.
However,
no matter what field we are in,
we must accept
the training provided by
the following three sets of knowledge.
The first is
physiological psychology.
No matter what field we are in,
we must understand
that there is a set of physiological mechanisms
behind everyone's behavior
and cognition.
In addition,
when we measure
the abstract phenomenon
in psychology,
we must be sure
that the phenomenon we measure
is what we think
in our mind.
This method
is usually a psychometric method.
It is the training
given to us
by the Department of Psychology.
The last is
developmental psychology.
Developmental psychology
provides us
with a holistic approach
that allows us to understand
that we are developing
with time.
The previous time point
will affect
my current behavior
at this time point.
My current time point
will also affect
my future time point.
We are all
constantly evolving
and developing.
In this case,
everyone will interact
with their society.
Therefore,
they will play different roles.
For example,
students,
partners,
friends,
and even parents.
Under these different roles,
there will be corresponding
cognitive development,
linguistic development,
personality development,
emotional development,
and even action development.
There are different issues
to discuss.
My own research
focuses on
the issues
related to
a person's role
as a parent.
In fact,
parenting psychology
is a very popular
research topic
in developmental psychology
in the past.
It is a very
new research topic.
I can't say it is new.
It is a very
popular research topic.
Some researchers even believe that
parenting's
related life experience
is a very central aspect
in our modern life.
The reason why
its experience
is so important
is that
after a person
becomes a parent,
he or she has done
a lot of things
and behaviors
that are driven
by parenting.

Parenting
is a wonderful experience.
As a parent,
we have experienced
a lot of things
that we have never experienced
in the past.
As a parent,
we have gained
a sense of meaning.

At the same time,
as a parent,
we have felt
a lot of pressure.
In my master's degree,
I have
focused on
general situations.

to discuss.
After I completed
a theoretical model
of a master's thesis,
I went to
Sousan High School
to be an intern teacher.
to be an intern teacher.
It's like
what I wrote on Facebook.
Maybe because
I graduated from
Taisa Psychology,
I am an intern teacher
in chemistry.
During the internship,
many parents
come to me
to discuss
the psychological development
of their children.
the psychological development
of their children.
We feel that
these parents
are not discussing
the development
of their children.
I feel that
these parents
need an ear
to listen to
their sufferings
in the past
ten years
or the past few years.
in the past ten years
or the past few years.
For example,
what they often tell me
is
Master,
I really don't know
what to do.
Can you help me?
We, as parents,
are really helpless.
We are really tired.
This group
is a group of
teenagers' parents
who told me
that
when they talk about
this paragraph,
they are crying.
They feel embarrassed
and
quickly wipe their tears
with their clothes.
and quickly wipe their tears
with their clothes.
During the internship,
during the internship,
I often
think again
and again
whether
my simple
daily
stress relief
model
is suitable
to explain
the strong depression
that these parents
feel.
to explain the strong depression
that these parents
feel.
At this time,
last year,
in 2019,
I met
my two bosses.
They are recruiting
PhD students
to discuss
the extreme
phenomenon
of parenting stress
especially for
parental burnout
.
Therefore,
I went from
NTU Psychology
to
the University of Paris
to discuss
a topic
specifically for
parental burnout
in my doctor's thesis
in more detail.
This brings me
to the main focus
of my report today,
parental burnout.
I will use
the five main aspects
to discuss
what parental burnout is.
I will discuss
this concept
from the historical background.
I will also
talk about
how we define
parental burnout
from the perspective
of psychology.
I will also ask
a question
about why
parental burnout
is so important.
It must be because
we consider
its consequences.
Finally,
we want to provide
a method
for parental burnout
to be treated.
Before treating it,
we must
have a clearer
understanding
of what
parental burnout
is.
If you are a parent,
you may have
experienced
these experiences.
If you are
a psychologist,
you may have
heard
these experiences
from your parents.
These experiences
are what we
visit
those parents
who have
been
traumatized
by parental burnout.
We visit them
and ask them
what their
experience
is.
They will
tell us
the same thing
that
their
experience
is
a
giant
fatigue.
They live
like a
robot
and deal
with
their
daily
life.
Their
daily
life
is
like
a
mess.
They
constantly
yell at
their
children
and
want to
take
care
of
their
children.
But they
realize
it's
hard to
control
their
children.
They
can't
stand
their
children.
The
worst
thing is
they
tell us
that
they
can't
imagine
them
becoming
their
child.
This
is
what
the
researchers
in
Sweden
found.
They
found that
if a
child
has
a
brain
tumor,
the
parents
tend to
have some
symptoms.
They
also
have
symptoms
in
other
children
with
a
brain
tumor.
If
a
child has
a brain
tumor,
the
parents
also
have
these
symptoms.
We
found this
in
families
with
special
children.
My
two
instructors
at
the
University
of
New
York
also
found
this
in
families
with
special
children.
Why
do they
ask this
question?
It's
because
they
observe
the
changes
in
the
culture
of
education.
The
first
thing is
that
the
parents
must
be
kind
and
supportive
and
sensitive
to
their
children.
If
you
have
seen
this
kind
of
propaganda,
you
can
see
that
there
are
positive
parenting
tips
in
Europe
and
the
EU.
There
is a
book
on how
parents can
teach
their
children.
One
of the
ideas is
positive
parenting.
In
Taiwan,
I've
seen
the
CDC
promoting
positive
parenting.
Another
thing is
that
children
are
under
the
government's
control.
For
example,
if
you
scold
your
children,
hit
them,
the
government
may
think
that
you
can't
teach
your
children
well
and
you
need
to
respect
your
children.
In
fact,
our
children
don't
respect
their
parents.
We
also see
that
our
husbands
still
maintain
their
jobs.
Many
women
are
working
now.
A
family
has
a
lot
of
time
to
take care
of
their
children,
so
the
time
they
have
to
take care
of
their
children
is
reduced.
It
is
easier
for
them to
feel
the
lack
of
time.
Because
of this,
I asked
if
we
might
see
parental
burnout
in
our
families.
In
our
recent
cross-cultural
research,
we
estimate
that
at least
5%
of
parents
in
the
United
States
have
parental
burnout.
We
have
seen
experts
talking
about
this.
We
have
seen
this
in
the
New York
Times,
CNN,
and
many
journalists
and
food
workers
talking
about
this.
We
have
seen
this
in
2017,
and
we
have
gathered
researchers
from
45 countries
and
more than
100 countries
to
talk about
what
is
parental
burnout.
We
are
concerned
about
whether
parental
burnout
is
something
we
should
be
concerned
about.
We
organize a
seminar
every year
to
share
the
results
of
parental
burnout.
We
held
the
first
conference
in
Belgium
last
year.
We
invite
you to
join
us
in
discussing
the
issue.
Let's
go back to
science.
To
discuss
parental
burnout,
we
need to
tell you
that
the
phenomenon
is
real.
We
define
parental
burnout
in
two ways.
The
first
is
the
concept
of
job burnout.
We
change it
into a
parenting
context.
The
top-down
approach
is
the
first
way.
The
second
way is
to
talk to
parents
with
parental
burnout
syndrome
.
We
define
it as
a
psychological
syndrome.
There
are four
symptoms.
The
first
symptom is
that
you feel
exhausted
by your
parental
role.
For
example,
I feel
completely
run down
by my
role as a
parent.
The
second
symptom
is that
you feel
emotionally
distant
from your
child.
For
example,
I do
what I
am supposed
to do
for my
children,
but
nothing
more.
The
third
symptom
is that
I
cannot
stand
my role
as a
mother
anymore.
I
don't
think I
am a
good
father,
mother,
like I
used to
be to
my
children.
After
defining the
four
symptoms of
parental
burnout,
we
asked
if the
concept
really
exists,
and
if it
is a
specific
concept.
We
took their
answers
and
did
a
factor
analysis,
and
we
found
that
the
model
that
separates
the
two
factors
is
more
suitable
than
combining
the
two
concepts
into
one
model.
We
found that
the
model
that
separates
the
two
factors
is
more
suitable
than
combining
the
two
concepts
into
one
model.

also
found that
