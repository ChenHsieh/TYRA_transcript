00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Hello everyone, welcome everyone to today's Tire Talk, we are very honored to invite Dr. Hong Shaoming today, he is now a post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology, and he is my colleague.

00:15.000 --> 00:31.000
He brought us today's speech topic is unconscious visual information processing, from sensory cells to language. If I'm not mistaken, most of the content of today's speech has been published recently.

00:31.000 --> 00:42.000
First of all, let me introduce Shaoming to you. Dr. Shaoming got his medical school degree from Duke University and the University of Singapore.

00:42.000 --> 00:56.000
When he was a doctor, his main job was to study the unconscious process. After he got his Ph.D., he came to Caltech.

00:56.000 --> 01:20.000
His current boss is Shinsuke Okada. His main job is to continue his Ph.D. research on the unconscious process. His main tools are psychophysics, fMRI, EEG, and eye tracking.

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
One thing that is different from the usual speech is that we now applaud and thank Shaoming for bringing us the speech, but we have to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear everyone's applause.

01:30.000 --> 01:45.000
Thank you for your introduction. I am Shaoming Hong. Thank you all for joining today's speech.

01:45.000 --> 01:53.000
Today I want to talk about a research topic that I am very interested in, which is unconscious information processing. I will focus on the visual level.

01:53.000 --> 02:02.000
As you can see from the title, there are two extremes, one is perception and the other is language. I want to tell you that unconscious language processing may cover a very large range.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
From perception, from light information to telemetry information, that is the first level of our visual and external world interaction.

02:09.000 --> 02:24.000
All the way to language, we usually think that language is a higher-level and more integrated message in the whole visual process. For example, you have to understand a sentence, you have to know the meaning of the words between them, and you have to know how different strokes work.

02:24.000 --> 02:35.000
Today I want to convey a message to everyone, that is, unconscious information processing may exist in different levels of visual information processing, which may cover a very wide range.

02:36.000 --> 02:51.000
What is consciousness? Until now, scientists have not been able to give a very good scientific definition. In this speech today, most people in the field of consciousness science use the definition that consciousness has sensory content.

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
For example, you can see the words on my slide now, which are in your visual consciousness. For example, you can hear my voice now, which is in your auditory sensory content.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
We say that you are aware of these auditory or visual stimuli and have sensory content.

03:04.000 --> 03:13.000
Is there any content? Do not be confused with the state of consciousness. What is the state of consciousness? For example, if you are too bored to talk about it, you may fall asleep and enter an unconscious state.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
What we are talking about today is not the state. What I am talking about today is the state of unconsciousness without sensory content.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
Is there any sensory content? You may often hear a metaphor. You can see the picture below. You may have seen it on the poster, which is a simple picture I drew myself.

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
Consciousness and unconscious processing seem to be just a corner of the iceberg. From the perspective of message processing, this may not be a big problem.

03:36.000 --> 03:45.000
Because we receive a lot of messages every minute and every second, but only a small part of the message is really presented in our consciousness.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
The rest of the messages that are not presented in our consciousness have always been a subject of research that I have been interested in.

03:51.000 --> 04:01.000
What happened to these messages? Did our brain ignore these messages and ignore them? Or can these messages still affect our brain and further affect our behavior?

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
There are three main questions to discuss today. The first question I want to ask is the question that I have been interested in since I was a classmate.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
What kind of information can be processed unconsciously? We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
The first is that simple, single-digit, and low-level messages can be processed in an unconscious situation.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
On the contrary, another hypothesis may be more complex, integrated, and high-level messages. These messages are more difficult to process, so they cannot be processed in an unconscious situation.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Or they can be processed. These are two opposing hypotheses.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
The second question I want to ask is whether unconscious processing is equivalent to automated processing.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
What does this mean? Once this process starts, it will not be disturbed by other external processes.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
We can have a very simple paradoxical hypothesis here.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
The first is that unconscious processing will not be affected by the difficulty of what we do consciously, or how we use our attention.

04:59.000 --> 05:11.000
On the contrary, another hypothesis may be that what we consciously process is more difficult, or what we do will interact with the unconscious message processing.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
These are two different hypotheses.

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
Finally, I want to turn to a completely different angle and discuss with you the neural basis of unconscious processing with the study of nucleus resonance and brain imaging.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Without further ado, let's move on to the first study.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
The first study I want to discuss with you is the integration relationship between sound and shape.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
We want to know if this integration relationship can be produced in an unconscious situation.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
If you look at the title, the title is actually a bit mysterious.

05:37.000 --> 05:46.000
What we want to say is that this word can sound round or sharp before we understand it.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
What does this mean?

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
If we want to answer this question, we may have to take a few steps back and think about what we originally wanted to ask.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
What we want to know is how we name an object.

05:59.000 --> 06:07.000
Imagine, for example, that 100,000 years ago, we may have some very basic language systems, but we do not have such complex grammar and structure as we do now.

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
When we go out to hunt, I see some objects, such as the stone on the left or the crystal on the right.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
When I go back to the group, I want to tell my master that the two things I see today are object A and object B.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
I must use two different sounds to express these two objects.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
In this case, what sound should we use to express these objects?

06:33.000 --> 06:44.000
A very famous contemporary linguist, Arthur Shearer, said that the process of using what sound or what object to express external objects is very likely to be arbitrary.

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
In other words, I use sound A to express the stone on the left, and sound B to express the crystal on the right.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
Perhaps another possibility is that different tribes or people with different languages ​​have a common connection.

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
They all tend to use a certain type of sound to represent the round object on the left, and then use another sound to represent the pointed object on the right.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
This means that there is a very strong connection between our sound and shape.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Does psychology have any evidence to support such a connection?

07:19.000 --> 07:28.000
In fact, we have a very famous cross-sensory sound and visual correspondence called Bubakiki Effect or Bubakiki Phenomenon.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
What is Bubakiki Phenomenon?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Those who have a background in psychology may be very familiar with it.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
If you don't have a background in psychology, imagine that you are an experimenter today.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
You walk into the lab and the experimenter tells you that what you are going to do today is very simple.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
We will show you two pictures, the round picture on the left and the pointed picture on the right.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
These two pictures are two words used by a remote African tribe.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
One of the words is called Bubakiki and the other is called Kiki.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Your job is very simple.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Your job is to tell us which one is Bubakiki and which one is Kiki.

07:56.000 --> 08:08.000
Even if you haven't heard of this phenomenon before, you may be able to guess what sound most people use to express the object on the left and what sound to express the object on the right.

08:08.000 --> 08:21.000
In fact, the answer is that people use a softer sound to express the round object on the left and a sharper sound to express the pointed object on the right.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
This is a phenomenon corresponding to sound and shape.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
This phenomenon is highly consistent.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Why do I say it is highly consistent?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
It is highly consistent that it can exceed the age.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
What does this mean?

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
In an experiment, they took a group of adults and a group of children under the age of three.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
They used different shapes on the right, round shapes, pointed shapes, and these words.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
The homework is the same as the homework you just did.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
They asked these children and adults to use these words to describe these shapes to name these shapes.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
They found that children under the age of three have a very similar pairing pattern with us.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
They also use a softer sound to describe these round shapes and a sharper sound to describe these pointed shapes.

09:07.000 --> 09:19.000
This means that the corresponding time between sound and shape can be very early, even before these children have a complete language training or a complete cultural experience.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
This is the first evidence.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
The second evidence is that this phenomenon is even a cross-language phenomenon.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
What does this mean?

09:28.000 --> 09:40.000
It means that regardless of whether your mother tongue is Chinese or Mandarin, English or German, the results of the experiment on different species are very similar.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
We use the sound of the round shape to represent the round shape, and vice versa.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
The real problem of our research is here.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Why does this happen?

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Here I provide two very intuitive hypotheses.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
The first hypothesis is that this is a conscious association.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
This consciousness is not the same as our whole speech to discuss consciousness.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
This means that we intentionally connect some things together.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
What does this mean?

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
It means that when I hear this thing, it sounds sharp and sharp.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
So this pattern is also sharp.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I want to connect these two things together.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
The original thing means the same.

10:16.000 --> 10:25.000
In other words, the reason why there is a connection between sound and shape is because everyone intentionally connects sound and shape together.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
This is a possibility.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But this possibility does not seem to be able to explain these past data very well.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Why are there such similar connections between children and adults?

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Or why do people who cross-language have such a connection?

10:38.000 --> 10:47.000
The second hypothesis is that perhaps the correspondence between sound and shape happened before these stimuli material entered our conscious state.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
So it is a very early processing process.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
This early processing process may be very common.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
So it can explain that we have seen these studies in adults and children, or in different languages.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You can find this Bubakiki effect.

11:03.000 --> 11:11.000
This whole study is used to test whether the Bubakiki effect can really occur in the unconscious state.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
So at the beginning, our research question is very simple.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
We want to know if the Bubakiki effect can occur in the unconscious state.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
The first experiment we did was very easy.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
We found some, for example, this round shape, and then paired with the word Bubu.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Then the pointed shape is paired with the word Kiki.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
These are the pair or congruent pairs we talked about.

11:34.000 --> 11:44.000
When you compare the word, the sound, and the shape, you will have an inconsistent pair.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
The question we want to ask is very simple.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
If we can make the receiver not see these pairs, and then we look at their reaction to these pairs.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
If it's still different, does that mean that they can still deal with sound and shape when they can't see these pairs?

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
The next question is, how do we make the receiver unable to see these pairs?

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Our approach is a technique called Continuous Flash Suppression.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
The concept is like this.

12:11.000 --> 12:19.000
In this case, if one eye shows you a very bright square, like these colorful squares, we call them Mondrians.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
When one eye looks at this colorful square, if the other eye lets you see a very bright square,

12:25.000 --> 12:35.000
it usually takes a few seconds for you to see the object on the other eye.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
In these few seconds, the object is basically unconscious to you or the visual material to you.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
What do we do at this time?

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
We put the congruent and incongruent pairs into your other eye.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
Then we measure how long it takes for the receiver to see.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
Our assumption is that if the congruence of sound and shape can be processed unconsciously or subconsciously,

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
the time when they see the higher congruence pair and the incongruence pair may be different.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
This is our assumption.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
I'll go into more detail about time.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
You'll see three different visual representations later.

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
Basically, one corresponds to their non-priority vision, one is the priority vision, and the other is the image that is closer to what they really see.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
At the beginning, there will be a random SOA.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
After the end, we'll show him two colorful flickering squares.

13:35.000 --> 13:43.000
What we're going to do is put a pair of congruence or incongruence in the other eye on the left or right.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
What they're going to do on this assignment is when they see any part of this pair,

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
press a button and we'll record the time it responds.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
So this is a detection task.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
We measure the time and we call it suppression time.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
It means that this pair can be suppressed.

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
How long can we keep it out of our consciousness?

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
Our assumption is that if the correspondence of sound and shape can exist before they enter our consciousness,

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
congruent pair and incongruent pair will spend different amounts of time.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
In order to make sure that the receiver has a good time doing this,

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
they see the stimulation material and then react, not just press a button.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
At the end of each trial, we also added a location task.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Basically, we just said,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Oh, you saw it.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Where did you see it?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Is it on the left or right?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
That's just to make sure that our receiver is a good receiver.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
You can see that the average accuracy rate is quite high here.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
When we analyze, we only analyze the trials that respond correctly.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Back to the question, what exactly did we find?

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
This is the 20 receivers we received in this experiment.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
There are a lot of things in this graph.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Let's look at the first column first.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
You can see a orange dot, which means that this is one of the receivers.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
The orange dot is the time it spends in incongruent pairs.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
The dark blue dot at the bottom is the time it spends in congruent pairs.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
The bar at the bottom is the difference between the two.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Its y-axis is on the right.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
So in other words,

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
this receiver needs to spend more time to see incongruent pairs.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
What we're doing here is very simple.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
We put these individual data together and make an average.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Then we see that this is the average of all people's data.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Then it's a positive bar.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
What does this mean?

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
We call it a congruency benefit.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
When the shape of the word and the outer circle is more consistent,

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
they will enter the state of consciousness of our receivers earlier.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
This means that the correspondence between the sound and the shape

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
seems to have been dealt with before entering the state of consciousness.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So in the first study,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
we pointed out to some extent that

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
it seems to occur before or before consciousness.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Then we found something called congruency benefit.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
When the sound and the shape are consistent,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
it will enter our state of consciousness earlier.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
For people who are more sensitive to experimental design or experiments,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
they immediately feel that it doesn't seem right.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
Let's take a step back and look at the relationship between the word and the shape.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
What we've been claiming is that the sound of the word,

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
the phonology of the sound, and the shape will have a congruency effect.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
When they are consistent, it's easier for you to see them.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
But the relationship between the word, the shape, and the inner circle

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
is the relationship between the word's word form, orthography, and shape.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
So in other words, if you look at these congruent pairs in our first experiment,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
they are not only correspondent between sound and shape,

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
they are also correspondent between shape and shape.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
In other words, the congruent pair looks more like it visually.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
In other words, we may have found some kind of integration phenomenon.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
But this integration phenomenon may not be cross-sensory,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
but only exists in the visual domain.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
So in other words, when the word looks very similar to the shape of the outside,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
the receiver will see it earlier.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
When it's not, the receiver will see it later.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
In order to prove that the sound really plays a very important role,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
we made some changes in the next experiment.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
We used some so-called neutral symbols or neutral text.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
These things look neither far nor near.

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
What we do is that we train the receiver to put the sound on these symbols.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
So the receiver will call these symbols bubu or kiki.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Then let's see if the symbols they trained

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
can produce the congruency benefit we just saw with a higher consistency shape.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
It's still a bit abstract, so I'll go straight into the details of our experiment.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
This time we really chose two languages from Africa,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
called bi-language.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
You can see that there are two different texts on the left.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Why did we choose this language?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Why did we choose these two different letters?

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Because in another study,

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
our collaborators found that

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
if you ask the receiver to pair the two different words on the left and right

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
with different sounds,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
the receiver basically has no preference.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
If you ask them to pair with a sharp sound or a round sound,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
their response is usually chance, 50%.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
So we defined these as neutral letters.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It's neither round nor sharp.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
What we do is very simple.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
We ask the receiver to connect this to the sound of kiki or bubu.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Let's take a sip of water.

18:37.000 --> 18:46.000
There are two stages in this experiment.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The first one is the training session.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
What we do in the training session is to let them do a very simple matching task.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
At the beginning, they will hear a sound.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
You can see that in the upper right corner, they hear the sound of bubu or kiki.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Then they see one of the words in the two words.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
What they have to do is tell us that this is matched or unmatched.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
At the end of each trial, we will tell them that what they did was right or wrong.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
So we didn't really tell them what was matched and what was unmatched.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
It's up to them to figure out what the composition between them is at the end of each trial.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Through this training method,

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
if they answer 20 questions in a row,

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
we assume that they have learned which word and which sound should be paired.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
In other words, in this experiment,

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
the consistency of things depends on what word is paired with what sound.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
For example, we collected two experiments here, two groups of subjects.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
In 2A, we asked them to pair this word with bubu and this word with kiki.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
In other words, these two pairs are congruent in 2A.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
In 2B, we collect another group of subjects and reverse the pairing relationship.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
At this time, the pairs in the lower right corner become incongruent pairs.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
As I just said,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
the congruency depends entirely on what the word represents.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
After the training, these subjects will move on to the next stage.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Basically, it's exactly the same as the experiment we did before,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
but now we use these neutral symbols.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
What did we find?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Let me recap for you.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
In the first time, we found this congruency benefit.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
When the shape of the word and the outside is more consistent,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
In 2A and 2B, we also found a very similar phenomenon.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
In other words, the point is not the shape of the word, but the sound represented by the word.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
As long as the sound and the shape of the outside are more consistent,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
After this experiment,

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
we found that a short training can cause a very similar unconscious phenomenon.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
That is, if the shape of the word is consistent with the outside,

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
If you follow this stage carefully,

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
you will find that there is no sound element in the formal experiment.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
How does our sound element come from?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Let's assume that after it sees the word,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
it will extract the sound of the word.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
If the sound is consistent with the shape of the outside,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
it will move on to our conscious state earlier.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
If the sound is inconsistent with the shape of the outside,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
it will move on to our conscious state later.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
So the sound is a bit like we assume that they will read the sound of the word.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
So in the next experiment,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
we want to directly introduce the sound component.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
If we directly introduce the sound component,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
according to the results we found before,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
this sound should help a shape you couldn't see originally.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
If they are consistent,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
it should help you see the shape you couldn't see originally.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
At this time, we turn to another paradigm,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
which is called the masking paradigm.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
This approach is like this.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
We will present a visual shape.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
This situation is also a pointed shape or a round shape.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The presented time is only 33 milliseconds.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So if you use a 60Hz monitor,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
it's about two frames.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
The time is actually quite short.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Before and after this time,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
we will put some noisy patterns.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
These noisy patterns are to make you unable to see the shape.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
In fact, the whole experiment is that the receiver will answer,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
oh, I saw it or I didn't see it.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
In the process of their answer,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
we will do some staircasing to adjust the brightness of this thing.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
So what we want to know is

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
what is the threshold for the receiver to see this shape?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
How high or low do we want to adjust the brightness?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
The receiver will just see this shape.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
The important thing at this time is that

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
we will play a sound at the same time,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
or 150 milliseconds before or after.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
This sound may be consistent with this pattern or inconsistent.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
According to our previous results,

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
if this sound is consistent with this pattern,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
it should help the receiver see this pattern.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Is that true?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
The answer is that this is true.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
We found that if the sound is played

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
at 150 milliseconds before the shape,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
the receiver will have a significant threshold reduction phenomenon.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
yx is the threshold.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
You can think of this as

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
how many luminance they need to see the shape.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
So the lower it is, the easier it is to see the shape.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
So when the sound is played at 150 milliseconds before,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
if the sound is consistent with the shape,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
the receiver will be easier to see the shape.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Again, it means that

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
the integration between the sound and the shape

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
is very likely to occur in a preconscious state

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
or unconscious state.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Through this series of studies,

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
the first thing we found was that

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
the effect of boobakiki

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
can occur in an unconscious state

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
or in a conscious state.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
We also explained that

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
the important thing is what the word itself represents,

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
what the sound is,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
not what the shape of the word is.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Finally, we found that

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
if you use a sound directly,

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
it will help a shape

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
that should have been hidden by the mask

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
to be seen more easily.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
So again, it proves that

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
the correspondence between sound and shape

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
is very likely to occur

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
before the conscious threshold.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
This is the first part of the experiment.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Do you have any questions?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
If it's too fast or too slow,

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
you can tell me.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
If you have any questions,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
you can type next to me,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
and I will help you ask.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
You can also turn on the microphone yourself to ask.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
But we set the microphone to silent.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
So if you didn't notice,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
you have to turn on the microphone

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
to ask questions.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I have a question.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Sorry.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Go ahead.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
In the picture of the contrast,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
does the contrast mean

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
that 22% and 23%

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
are gray and black?

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
The contrast is actually the alpha value.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
OK.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Isn't 22% and 23% very different?

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I can't see it with my naked eye.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Yes, it's very different.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
The unconscious effect is usually very small.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
One of the reasons is that

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
in the process of doing these experiments,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
we want to make the audience unable to see.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
For example, there are two ways.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
The first is to make it very dark.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
The second is to use masking or CFS

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
to make people unable to see.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
So we intentionally or unintentionally

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
make the amount of information very small.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Usually the effect will not be very large.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Of course, this is statistically significant.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
But it's hard to tell the difference

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
between the two.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
But this is actually the point.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
The point is that

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
in your consciousness,

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
you can't tell the difference.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
OK.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
But maybe your eyes

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
can still tell the difference.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
But we consciously eliminated it.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
So I can't feel it.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
You can say that.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
OK. Thank you.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
OK.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Let's move on to the next research.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
If you have any questions,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
we can come back and discuss.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
OK.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
In this experiment,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
we will explain to you that

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
the integration between sound and shape

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
can occur in the unconscious state.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
The next research I want to talk to you about is...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Sorry.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Someone has a question.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
He's next to me.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
OK.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
His question is this.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
He said he wanted to ask

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
how to test the difference between

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
the dominant eye

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
and the dominant eye.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
What part of the experiment will it affect?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
OK.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
This is a good question.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't have the official results

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
to support the second question.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
But if I remember correctly,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
the dominant eye is

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
when you put the design material

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
and what you want the other person to see,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
which we call the suppressor,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
in which eye?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
I remember doing it.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
The results are similar.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
So it's a bit like a convention.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
We put the suppressor on the dominant eye

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
because it's usually easier for you

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
to see what's on the other eye.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Because it's your superior eye.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
So relatively speaking,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
if what's on that eye is very salient,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
it's even harder for you to see

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
what's on the other eye.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
This is the reason.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
So how do we know the dominant eye?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
There are many ways to test it.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
The simplest way is that

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
you can, for example,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
form a small hole.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
You can stretch out your hand

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
and look at something through the hole.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Both of your eyes have to open.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
At this time,

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
you close one of your eyes,

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
and you'll find that

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
only one eye can see

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
what you're looking at.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
That eye,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
we usually call it the dominant eye.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
When I force you to use one eye,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
which eye will you look at?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
You can try it later.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Excuse me.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Can I ask a question?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Go ahead.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
My name is Wen Wen.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I'm from the University of Tokyo.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Hello.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I'd like to ask,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
will there be a discussion later

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
about why there's this

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
congruence benefit?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Why do consistent things

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
enter the conference earlier

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
than inconsistent things?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Because in different fields,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
sometimes inconsistent things

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
may be more salient.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
And consistent things

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
are not very attractive.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Why do consistent things

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
in perception

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
have a more attractive position?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
That's a good question.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
And I've been facing this question myself.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Because in my different experiments,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
sometimes consistent things

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
enter the state of consistency earlier,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
and sometimes inconsistent things

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
enter the state of consistency earlier.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
I'll come back.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
I'll come back to this question

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
after all three of my research is done.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Okay, thank you.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't know how you control your time,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
but I have a question.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
If you think this is too much,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
we can ask together at the end.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Okay, I'll speak faster.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
How do you control

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
the age and gender of the audience?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
There's no control in this study.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
So we basically collect young people,

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
18 to 35 years old.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
This is a visual study.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
It's a bit of a conventional convention.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And gender is balanced.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Age is that period.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Gender is balanced.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Okay, I'm going to move on to the next study.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
So in the next study,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm going to talk about a

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
unconscious science.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Everyone is relative.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Unconscious science is not a very popular science.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
But in unconscious science,

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
of course, there are also more popular things.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
That is,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
unconscious meaning or language processing.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Okay, I want to tell you that

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
this language processing

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
will still be controlled by

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
the high and low difficulty of what we do.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Okay, like I said,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Unconscious meaning or language processing

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
has always been a

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
prominent field in this field.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Why?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
In fact, intuitively speaking,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
if we find that there is unconscious processing today,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
the first thing I will be interested in is

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
that when I didn't see this word

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
or didn't hear this word,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
can I understand what it means?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
This is actually a pretty intuitive

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
and everyone wants to know the problem.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
That's true.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
This field has been studied for decades.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Everyone in different visual paradigms,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
including Mr. Ye Su-lin of the Taiwan Psychological Department,

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
also found that

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
the meaning of a word,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
even if you don't see it,

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
can also be read by you.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
It will even affect the judgment of another word.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Okay, as you can see,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
in the third Continuous Flash Suppression,

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
this is the paradigm we used

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
in the first experiment.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Okay, under this paradigm,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
unfortunately or even luckily,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
in fact, its results have not been stable.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Some experimenters found that

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
the meaning of the word can indeed

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
survive under this paradigm.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Even if the recipient can't see the word,

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
the meaning of the word seems to be able to be extracted

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
and then affect their judgment of another task.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Some of the experiments

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
did not work.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Okay, this experiment,

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
this study,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
the initial intention

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
is actually to know

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
why there is this difference.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
We want to make a big assumption

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
that maybe in different paradigms,

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
everyone uses the same paradigm,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
but some people find it,

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
some people can't find it.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
The reason is actually something else.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
The reason we want to mention here is

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
whether it is related to the difficulty of the task.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
What does this mean?

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
It means that

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
we assume that there is conscious processing

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
and unconscious processing.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Conscious processing

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
actually shares the same resources.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
You can think of it as attention.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
If they share the same resources,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
then conscious processing,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
if the task is more difficult,

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
then you spend all the resources.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Your unconscious processing

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
can't be produced.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
In other words,

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
if you do this conscious task now,

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
it's actually quite simple.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Then you have more resources

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
that can be distributed to unconscious processing.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Next, we want to discuss this study

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
with everyone

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
to see if this hypothesis is true.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
In order to test this hypothesis,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
we made a paradigm called

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Double Stroke Paradigm.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
What is this paradigm?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
For example, I will show you two words now.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
You may be very intuitive to read red and blue.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Of course, there are other reasons

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
why people don't read blue and red.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
But one of the reasons is

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
if I ask you to read the colors of these words now,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
the left is blue and the right is red,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
you will find that reading colors

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
is much more difficult than reading words.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Why?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Because when we read colors,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
we are easily disturbed by words.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
This is a famous

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Stroke phenomenon.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
You don't have to worry that

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
our readers will not read red and blue,

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
because we are doing research in English.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
So in the case of reading colors,

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
as I just said,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
usually the reader will have a higher

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
level of language interference,

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
so they want to read words.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Because reading words is a stronger process,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
and it is usually relatively automated.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
On the other hand,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
when they read words,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
they usually read better.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Because the color here

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
has a weaker effect.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
If there is an effect,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
it is usually called the Reverse Stroke Effect.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Let's define these two different conditions

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
as high-low and low-low.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
In the case of reading words,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
it is relatively simple, it is low-low.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
But in the case of reading colors,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
it is more difficult, it is high-low.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
What we want to know is

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
if we put another word

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
before they react to this word

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
so that they can't see it,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
will the consistency between the two words

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
affect their judgment of this word?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
If it does,

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
what should it be in?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Should it be in a high-difficulty situation

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
or a low-difficulty situation?

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
I will go into the details of our research.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
The same is used here

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
is the paradigm of double-eyed reading.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
So you will still see

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
three different strings later.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
At the beginning,

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
we just try to

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
keep the first word from being seen.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
This is a bit different from before.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Before, we wanted to measure

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
how long that thing would be seen.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
In this experiment,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
we don't want it to be seen.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
So let's show you again.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
This is actually a

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
slightly different paradigm.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
You will find that the way it flashes

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
is a bit different.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
If you want to know the technical details,

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
we can discuss it later.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
What we want to do

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
is just to make the receiver see this word.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
So the receiver in this process,

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
when we put the first word

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
prime,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
it can actually react.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
If it says, oh, I saw it,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
they press a button,

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
we will label this trial

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
as a conscious trial.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
These trials

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
will not be analyzed later.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
What we are interested in

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
is when they can't see this word,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
how do they affect the next word?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
In this process,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
they say they can see it.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
In the process of not seeing it,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
we will adjust the brightness of this word

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
to keep this word

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
always almost visible

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
and a little bit invisible.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
If they don't see the word

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
in this situation,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
we will move on to the next stage.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
We will present a word with color.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
We will teach it

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
to read words in some experiments.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
In some experiments,

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
we teach it to read colors.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
That's the case of low difficulty

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
and high difficulty.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
In the first layer,

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
when we say,

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
oh, it can actively report

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
that it has seen

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
or has not seen the word,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
that is a subjective report

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
that they have not realized this word.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
We also want to establish

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
an objective standard

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
that when it really

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
didn't see this word,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
what would happen?

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
What we do is

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
we add a location task.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
What is this?

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
At the end of each trial,

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
we ask it to judge

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
and ask it to guess

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
that you just didn't see that word,

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
that prime.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Please guess

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
whether the word

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
is above or below.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
That's the logic.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
If it really didn't see that word,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
then its performance on this task

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
should be chance,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
because it didn't see that word.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Indeed, across several experiments,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
we found in this study

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
that their performance

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
on the location task

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
is about chance,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
and there is no difference

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
with 50%.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
So we want to establish

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
that subjectively and objectively,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
it really didn't see that word.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
In the case that it didn't see

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
that word,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
if the two words

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
are not the same,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
will it affect you

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
to read words or read colors?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
The answer is yes.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
This is the case of reading words.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
The case of reading words

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
is a relatively low-difficulty situation.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
You can see that the left corner

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
is our result.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
This is when the two words

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
are the same,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
it is congruent.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
This is the case where the two words

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
are inconsistent.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
In an inconsistent situation,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
they will take about 5% of the time.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
This is a standardized

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
normalized RT,

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
because we put a lot of

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
blank trials

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
at the same time

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
in this experiment,

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
that is,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
in the case

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
where the word should be put,

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
the word should be put,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
we sometimes

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
didn't show anything.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
So that's our baseline.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
So compared to the baseline,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
if the two words are inconsistent,

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
they will take

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
about 5% of the time.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
This is a relatively simple

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
case of reading words.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
In the case of reading colors,

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
this is a high-low,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
a more difficult situation.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
We found that this effect

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
disappeared.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
So at least so far,

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
this seems to indicate that

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
unconscious processing

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
does not seem to be so automated.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Because the exact same design

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
is in one situation,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
there will be

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
unconscious interference.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
In another situation,

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
there will be

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
unconscious interference.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
What happened?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Just like we just said,

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
we just assumed at the beginning

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
that this was related to

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
the difficulty of the task,

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
the high and low.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
If it really has

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
something to do with

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
the difficulty of the task,

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
then think about it.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
This is a

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
reading color is

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
a relatively difficult task.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
If I keep training

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
the collector to do this task,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
let him do it for a long time,

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
do it to a level

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
that he becomes very powerful.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
In theory,

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
this high-difficulty task

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
becomes simpler and simpler,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
becoming a low-difficulty task.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
When this high-difficulty task

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
becomes a low-difficulty task,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
if we follow our theory,

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
it should have more resources

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
that can be distributed to

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
unconscious information processing.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
At this time,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
interference should be re-generated.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
If you have participated in

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
visual research,

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
you will find that

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
visual scientists love to

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
do a lot of trials.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
In fact,

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
at this time,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
we have also

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
taught everyone to do

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
about 350 trials.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
So they did

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
a total of

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
30-40 minutes.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
The first thing we want to do

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
is to see

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
if there is a difference

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
in the performance of the

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
previous trial and the

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
subsequent trial.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Compared with the

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
previous quarter trial

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
and the subsequent quarter trial,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
they are faster

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
in the subsequent quarter trial.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
We found that

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
this may mean that

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
the difficulty of this task

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
has relatively

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
become lower

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
because they do better and better.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
At this time,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
let's look at

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
the first

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
quarter trial.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Basically,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
their performance

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
is very similar

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
to that of all

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
trials.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
They will not be

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
interfered with

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
by

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
this

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
unconscious word.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
In the subsequent

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
quarter trial,

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
we found that

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
the original interference

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
phenomenon

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
was produced

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
when we

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
saw the

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
interference

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
phenomenon

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
when we

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
read the

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
words.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
At this time,

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
it conforms to

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
our assumption

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
that

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
when the

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
first

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
quarter trial

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
occurs,

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
the

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
second

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
quarter trial

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
occurs.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
The

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
combination of

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
the two

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
experiments

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
at least

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
explains

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
one thing,

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
which is

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
the

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
unconscious

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
prime

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
that

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
they can't

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
see,

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
and

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
the

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
unconscious

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
target

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
that

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
they

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
are reacting

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
to.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
When the

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
first

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
quarter trial

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
occurs,

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
they are

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
more likely

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
to be

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
interfered with

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
by

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
this

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
unconscious

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
word.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
When the

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
second

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
quarter trial

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
occurs,

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
they are

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
more likely

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
to be

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
interfered with

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
by

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
this

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
unconscious

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
word.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
When the

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
first

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
quarter trial

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
occurs,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
they are

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
more likely

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
to be

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
interfered with

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
by

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
this

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
cold

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
object

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
or

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
subconscious

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
object.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
When the

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
second

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
quarter trial

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
occurs,

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
they

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
are

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
more likely

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
to be

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
interfered with

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
by

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
this

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
unconscious

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
object before

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
the

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
first

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
trial.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
In fact,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
we call the

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
observer to pay

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
attention to the

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
meaning of the

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
word, so

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
we ask him to

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
pay attention to

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
the phenomenon

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
that we want

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
to see.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
That is a

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
speech interference

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
phenomenon.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
These two

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
things are

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
consistent,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
so we

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
say that

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
it is

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
cognitive

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
set

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
align or

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
task set

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
align.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
On the

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
contrary,

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
when we

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
see this

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
phenomenon,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
it is

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
likely that

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
it is not

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
a task

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
difficulty

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
adjustment,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
but a

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
different reason

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
for the

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
nature of

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
their

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
work.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
This

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
explanation

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
can also

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
explain

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
our

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
results.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Another

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
question you

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
may ask

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
is what

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
is the

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
consistency

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
that

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
causes

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
their

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
work

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
to

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
become

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
slower or

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
faster?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
We have

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
just mentioned

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
that it is

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
actually related to

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
the conflict

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
between the

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
meanings of

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
the two

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
words.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Another

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
possibility is

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
that our

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
prime word

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
is always

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
blue and

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
red,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
and our

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
target word

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
is always

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
blue and

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
red.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Maybe it's

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
related to

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
the conflict

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
between

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
the two

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
words.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
In order to

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
solve these

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
two problems

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
at the same time,

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
we did

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
two things

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
in the

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
following two

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
experiments.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
The first

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
thing is that

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
we replaced

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
the target

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
word with

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
these two

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
words,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Navy and

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Scarlet.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
These two

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
words still

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
have a consistent

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
or inconsistent

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
relationship

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
with the

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
original

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
word

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
meaning.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
A very

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
interesting phenomenon

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
is that when we

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
use these two

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
words as

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
target words,

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
when we ask

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
the user to

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
read the

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
color or

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
read the

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
words,

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
their difficulty

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
is completely

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
reversed.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
At this time,

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
when we

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
ask him to

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
read the

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
color,

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
he will not

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
be disturbed

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
by the

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
color.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
This is actually

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
also reported

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
in the text

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
file.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
In other

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
words,

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
in this

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
experiment,

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
if we

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
find any

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
interference,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
it will

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
come from

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
the word

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
meaning.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
If we

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
find interference

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
coming from

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
this new

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
low-difficulty

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
task,

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
that is,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
the task of

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
reading the

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
color,

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
it means that

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
the important

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
thing is

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
the difficulty

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
of the

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
task.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
If the

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
difficulty

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
of the

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
task is

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
easy to

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
be disturbed,

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
it means that

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
the important

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
thing is that

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
the thing

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
done by the

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
receiver is

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
consistent with

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
the interference

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
we want to

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
see,

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
that is,

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
the

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Cognitive

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Set is

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
aligned.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
What do

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
we find?

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
We found

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
no effect

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
in the

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
task of

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
reading the

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
word.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
This is a

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
new,

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
simple task.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
This is a

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
simple task.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
In this case,

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
without the

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
effect,

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
we found

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
a very similar

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
interference phenomenon

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
as before.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
When the

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
meaning of

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
these two

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
words is

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
different,

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
its reaction

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
will be slower.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Through

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
these two

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
experiments,

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
we can

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
tell everyone

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
that

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
only the

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
meaning of

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
the word

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
alone

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
can make

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
the receiver

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
see the

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
word

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
in a

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
consistent

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
way.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
We can

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
also say that

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
only the

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
meaning of

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
the word

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
alone

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
can

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
make

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
the receiver

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
see the

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
word

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
in a

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
consistent

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
way.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
We can

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
also say that

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
the

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
meaning of

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
the word

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
alone

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
is

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
not

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
consistent

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
with

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
the

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
meaning

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
of

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
the

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
word

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
in

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
a

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
consistent

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
way.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
We

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
can

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
also say

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
that

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
the

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
meaning of

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
the

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
word

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
alone

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
is

of

a

consistent

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000

We

can

also say
