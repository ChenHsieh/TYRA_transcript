0	17000	OK, thank you very much for being able to participate in the weekly speech of Taira today, and of course, thank you very much to our speaker today, Shen Mingxue, for sharing with us what she is going to talk about today.
17000	31000	Before we start, let me quickly introduce Ms. Mingxue. Mingxue is a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.
32000	41000	Next, we will continue to read about the details of space science related to the CU Boulder.
41000	48000	But I think the most interesting thing is that when I look at her introduction, it looks like a Star Trek fan.
48000	58000	This is the technology required for space exploration, as well as the research that needs to be solved, which is very exciting.
58000	67000	Without further ado, let's give the time to Mingxue, and then let me warmly welcome today's speaker, Shen Mingxue.
67000	77000	Shen Mingxue is a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.
77000	87000	She has a master's degree in aerospace engineering at Tsinghua University.
87000	114000	Today, I would like to introduce the measurement and exploration of cosmic dust.
114000	130000	If you can see my mouse on the right, we are using a lot of spacecraft.
130000	150000	What I do is related to space. When I was in college, I watched a lot of movies, so I wanted to know something about Star Trek.
150000	160000	There is a space engine in Star Trek, so I went to the teacher to ask him what kind of space engine could be used in space.
160000	170000	Later, I found that it was not practical, and when I was in the master's class, I was not good at it. There is an impulse drive on Star Trek, which is the so-called electric power engine.
170000	185000	So I went to the master's thesis and did an impulse drive. After doing it, I found that there were not many people using it in the world.
185000	198000	At that time, the propulsion in space was still a rocket or a coolant. My so-called rocket is only the chemical propulsion and combustion. This part is related to its propulsion or other things.
198000	205000	Another part is that you need to pay attention to the space environment where you are in the space when you are in space.
205000	215000	The space environment we are in today is very different from the one we are protected by the entire atmosphere. I went to do some research on the electric power layer later.
215000	227000	Now when I come here, we start to do star science and do some aspects related to cosmic dust. I have done some data analysis of Cassini.
227000	238000	What I have been doing recently is the Parker Solar Propeller and the Solar Orbiter. The one above is NASA, and the one below is a project mainly cooperated by ESA and NASA.
238000	250000	Both are orbiting within a solar unit within 1 AU near the sun. Why is it special? I want to mention this distance.
250000	265000	When we talk about cosmic dust later, the space environment is close to the distance of the sun, the position of the solar unit on the earth, and even the outer solar system.
265000	278000	The space environment is different. This will lead to the charging effect of our probe or spacecraft, that is, the charging effect on it or the position it is in is different.
278000	288000	It will have a different interaction with the surrounding background environment, which may lead to different things happening on both sides of cosmic dust.
288000	299000	The first thing we need to talk about is dust. When we go to the beach, there is also sand, or when you wipe the floor, there will be some dust. These are indeed called dust in Chinese.
300000	311000	But scientifically speaking, these dusts still have to start with the Big Bang, which is the large-scale theory we are talking about. After all, it is the source of all matter.
311000	327000	So the Big Bang is the beginning, and then it starts to gather or form some hydrogen or hydrogen, and then it slowly starts to have more and more ions, and then it finally forms more atoms and molecules.
327000	339000	In the end, it forms our galaxy or the entire universe. In the middle of this process, cosmic dust is often a very important role.
339000	353000	You often see some photos in astronomy about the nebula. The nebula is simply a cluster of clouds, which contains a lot of gas or dust.
353000	366000	When they gather together, they become such a nebula. But because there is density inside, so when they get denser and denser, another singular noun is dense molecular cloud.
366000	374000	It is also a part of the nebula, but it slowly, because at the beginning of the universe, we said there was a strange point, and it was very hot.
375000	386000	After it began to slowly expand, its temperature began to drop. After a long time, when its temperature became slightly less than high, and then slightly denser and denser, it began to form molecules.
386000	395000	In the process of these formations, it slowly began to evolve and form. When those heavier and heavier substances are formed, they slowly gather.
395000	402000	Because of some gravity, it will begin to form some possible stars that are going to form a star.
402000	413000	Next, another form will appear, which is the stellar nebula. It is really going to form our star. It will encounter some gravitational collapse and gather it up.
413000	420000	Then, its core will begin to heat up more and more until it begins to form a fusion state.
420000	442000	In the process of these, all of their molecules, atoms, and gatherings will begin to encounter some fine, iron, aluminum processes, plus some high-energy UV or other high-energy ions colliding.
442000	460000	It will produce some basic examples of cosmic dust. At present, it is still in a theoretical state, which means that its theory is not yet complete, and we do not yet know how they are produced.
460000	470000	After all, if we can be clear about this, we may be able to start thinking about how organic matter is produced, or how our life originates.
470000	481000	In the end, this whole situation will begin to form an original nebula. The center of the original nebula is a star, and then it will start to rotate around the orbit.
481000	491000	After the orbit, they will begin to gather into 10 stones, larger asteroids, and even form the eight stars we are in.
492000	515000	In these cases, it forms a so-called stable orbit, which means that when you have a star-shaped orbit like the Earth, we will roughly clear out the dust of these places around the distance of our astronomical unit, either gathered or sucked into the atmosphere.
515000	526000	If there is no gathering, there will be a small nebula between the Earth and Mars that we are familiar with.
526000	534000	After billions of years, when the sun is no longer the current yellow, it slowly becomes a red giant and slowly reaches the end of its life.
534000	543000	As soon as it explodes, it swallows all of our stars, and then it spits out those substances. It eventually becomes a small stone, becomes dust, and returns to the origin.
543000	553000	That is, in the end, this so-called planetary nebula is directly blown up, and then it becomes a very beautiful, clouded image.
553000	572000	That's why we usually say dust to dust. The reason we say dust to dust is because some of the cosmic dust that was created at the beginning, some small substances, and then slowly gather together to form bigger things, until they can become a solar system, a star system.
572000	589000	In the process, there will be some satellites, some small stars, and then interplanetary dust. In the end, after the whole explosion is blown up, it will all come back again.
589000	598000	In other words, all of us here are a part of the star system, and we are all their main components.
598000	612000	Okay, let's jump back. In the solar system, we have a lot of cosmic dust. In the upper left corner, this is our Cassini, which was on its way to Saturn.
612000	628000	It encountered a satellite in the middle called Enceladus. The interesting thing is that it will spray this kind of water ice dust in its south pole. We call it dust, or we call it a small particle, a small crystal.
628000	651000	Scientists are very interested in whether there will be any life on the surface of the ice. The other one is that it can produce Saturn's E-ring, E-ring, the little crystals that we can see, which are made up of these dust.
651000	665000	Or in the upper right corner, our moon also has a lot of dust, and then it will have some dust because of some magnetic field fluctuations and some external solar wind blowing.
665000	672000	That is, before the astronauts went up there to step on a footprint and stepped on that footprint, that was the dust.
673000	691000	There are also some very interesting examples, such as the Saturn satellite Io in the lower left corner. The volcano will erupt, and after it erupts, the particles that erupt into dust will start to go into the solar system after the gravity of Saturn's star group is finished.
691000	712000	So there will be a part of the group coming from there near our Earth. Or we used to have people, uh, Rosetta, right, uh, European probe, they went to this, uh, 67P to learn about these dust streams.
712000	726000	Or the Japanese who just came back, they just picked up some dust from the little stars of the Dragon Palace. Or the next new flagship plan is to go to another satellite in Jupiter, Europa, to measure some of the cosmic dust.
726000	738000	Okay, so is there anything closer? First of all, the cosmic dust is probably going to look like this, and it's probably within a few microns. Of course, if it's a little bigger, it's probably up to 100 to 1000 microns.
738000	753000	There is also a kind of classification, the so-called nanodust. The main thing is that if you are on our Earth, uh, I remember it was early in the morning to the east, uh, west to the east, to the west.
753000	769000	When you look to the west, you will see something like yellow light, and yellow light is interplanetary dust, which is the so-called dust in the solar system, which is constantly fixed by the gravity of the sun, and it has its own orbit.
770000	787000	It will scatter some of the sunlight, and what we see is the yellow light, and what we just saw is the bright E ring, which is what we just said, Enceladus, which is caused by the dust of those ice crystals blown out by the South Pole.
787000	798000	No, or when our comet usually passes by, we will see the dust tail, the dust tail, so the dust tail is the dust tail, which is our dust.
798000	816000	Well, since we have a lot of dust in our solar system, how do we measure it? There are a lot of measurements on the right side, including you can see the light, you can see the thermal emission, or someone can use the radar, even like Arecibo, Arecibo Astronomical Observatory, they can measure some, uh, some things about the comet.
816000	837000	Well, the main thing we do in space, if we use a satellite or a spacecraft to measure, it is the so-called impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization, which is the impact ionization.
838000	849000	Well, what about this thing? The impact ionization mechanism is directly related to the volume or weight of your dust.
850000	864000	So what is the mechanism of the impact ionization? If we have a high-speed L, which is generally considered high-speed, which is at least greater than 1 km per second, if our dust hits any surface,
864000	877000	then the first thing that comes out may be some neutral particles or ions or electrons, because we have tied it up, uh, to become impact ionization, which is ionization.
877000	888000	So there will be ions and electrons, and of course some solid pieces will be sprayed out, which is from those, from that spacecraft or anything else.
888000	902000	Then its formula, here you will mainly see that it is related to the weight of your cosmic dust and the speed of its impact, and the speed of this impact is even more powerful.
902000	915000	Okay, so why do we say this is important? The first one is that we can use this mechanism to understand the weight of your impact, and the weight will usually be directly or indirectly related to its volume.
915000	932000	The other one we can know its speed, so when we know its weight and speed, if we can use other methods to know the location or source of its impact, we can roughly simulate its orbit, its position, its size in the entire solar system.
932000	948000	If we go back, we can understand where it may come from, from Jupiter, from Saturn, or where it comes from. If we go back, we may understand, uh, or even know, uh, how long these dusts have lived in the solar system.
948000	970000	Can it tell us some information about life that happened a long time ago or something? What about the electromagnetic cloud generated by the impact plasma cloud? Some related formulas may be related to some temperature, some speed, and some other things.
970000	989000	So how can we measure it? Generally speaking, it is not measured by the antenna we are talking about. It is actually measured by some of these so-called, uh, a lot of electrical networks.
1020000	1037000	Then we can get some scale maps, and from the scale map, we can know that, uh, the ice or dust that hit it contains some, uh, gas, carbon, CH-related, or some silver, iron, uh, uh, gold, or something else.
1037000	1049000	Then these can help us understand that the components on it and even whether there are some organic matter. The one in the upper left corner is the Cassini project.
1049000	1064000	Well, the instrument it carries is something similar in the middle. There is another very interesting thing that, uh, they used to install some so-called PVDF, which is a very thin film.
1064000	1078000	That thin film is when there is ice or dust hitting it, it will also produce a similar electrical signal. This is just the difference between different instruments, but it is actually the same, uh, mechanism to measure.
1079000	1091000	Okay, so let's go back to how we use the antenna to measure. How does the antenna do the measurement? It must have a collision at the beginning to measure something.
1091000	1111000	After the collision, it is 5 to 10 or 12 kilometers per second because of the high speed. This is relative to the speed of our probe, which means that when the probe flies 100 kilometers per second, like Parker Solar Probe, it actually flies faster.
1111000	1128000	After the collision, it produces the electric field cloud of Impact Plasma Cloud. It will start to expand because it is going to leave. At this time, we will have the effect of charging on the probe or on our antenna.
1128000	1144000	In the end, it will be our background, because we are actually in the state of electric field in space. The electric field in our space mainly comes from some of the electrons, light, or other direct things brought by the solar wind.
1144000	1162000	Let's talk about the space environment a little later. So we mainly find that if a main instrument, like the one just now, is very expensive, several kilograms, 7, 8 kilograms, or even more than 10 kilograms, it can only be measured in such a small place.
1162000	1180000	But what about our antenna instrument? Our antenna instrument has a form called monopole. The difference in its measurement location is on the antenna and our probe. That is to say, anything can hit the antenna.
1180000	1204000	It can also hit any part of the body of the entire probe. In other words, the entire probe is the surface area that we can measure. Compared to this small, special one, we will tell people that, of course, what we can measure is definitely not as complicated as the design just now.
1204000	1225000	It may be more complicated to measure, and it may even be flat. But we can tell them more supplementary information and some basic features of Impact Plasma Cloud. So we will say that it is very sensitive because it has a very large measuring surface area.
1226000	1240000	When we do research, the predecessor must have done something. What the predecessors have done is probably to say that they found that they provided some theory that after the impact, they felt that all signals were only related to the antenna.
1240000	1264000	They did not consider the fact that they hit the probe, and they said that they felt that because the antenna was measuring something, it was just a probe, so it was only related to the antenna. The second person said that after the object hit it, I think it may be related to the antenna, but mainly because it hit the body, so its formula is only related to the spacecraft itself.
1264000	1282000	The third person said that I think what you said before is wrong. Since our formula is called the difference between the signal on the antenna and the signal on the probe, the two may be able to measure something.
1282000	1305000	So he used a correct idea to do it, but he did not know how to understand how this signal was, so he assumed some mathematical formulas and then did fitting, and then he found that the fitting was not very good, so he kept introducing new variables, and then after the introduction, he gave some experimental parameters, and finally found that it was OK.
1305000	1319000	So we will sum up the above, we will find that in fact, we may not know how the signal is produced, but we know that there is a signal, and there is no good qualitative model at present, which is what we want to do.
1320000	1338000	Fortunately, what the people in front of them do is to analyze two things in space. At Colorado University, we can not only do those analyzes, but we also have a so-called accelerator, we can simulate the impact of dust.
1338000	1350000	What kind of device is this? It is a peletron, which you can imagine as a static accelerator, which is what I call an electron cannon.
1350000	1364000	It will pass through some of our middle Particle Selection Units, which is the speed at which we can control the impact above. We can set our model to the lower left corner, which is a space probe model.
1364000	1379000	We can set its floating position on the body, which is about how much. We can know that different antenna configurations are actually different, and the impact position will be related later.
1379000	1393000	There is another one, because after we collide, we produce electrons and ions. If some of the students of the Institute of Engineering or the Institute of Physics know that electrons and ions, it will start to work with the battery factory, and it may rotate.
1394000	1408000	In this case, if we encounter a magnetic field, or some external magnetic field, the impact plasma that actually erupts will have a different shape.
1408000	1428000	Another one is that we find that the dust particles of different materials may have different reactions after they collide. This has a lot to do with the atomic mass contained in it, or some of its other substances on the surface of the probe surface.
1428000	1450000	Later, we will talk about this thing, which is more mathematical or physical. We will talk about Induced Charging and Direct Charging. In other words, if you imagine this yellow ball as a charge, you put a dot outside.
1450000	1469000	Finally, after we go through the so-called image charge method, we will sum it up. In other words, on this whole ball, in fact, this ball is the subsequent probe. What you measure will include the entire charge on this ball, your probe.
1469000	1486000	In addition, when the external charge is further away, it will have a 1 over r decay, which is a lot of electric field, or electric position, or something else.
1486000	1504000	When you are close to your parents, you have a greater limit, and when you are far away, the limit you are subject to is relatively small, and the impact you are subject to is relatively small. So what's on top of this is fixed, but what's far away from the dot will be reduced with the distance.
1505000	1516000	So what about our antenna signal? You will find that this is very similar to the thing I just drew, the Cassini number.
1516000	1531000	After we hit it, didn't we just say that there was a cloud, and then it went out? At this time, in general, the electrons will expand faster, and then the ions will expand slower.
1531000	1545000	In this case, it will produce a signal similar to the one in the lower left corner. The main source of this situation is because your spacecraft may be positive or negative.
1545000	1557000	If your probe is positive, you will absorb some negative electrons on the surface with positive electricity, and you may be negative.
1557000	1572000	Then all the ions will leave, and then these leave, which is what we just talked about. In the process of leaving, it will produce different positions on your probe correspondingly.
1572000	1592000	In general, you can imagine a situation, and then the electrons start to go out, so the electrons go out correspondingly to the ions that remain on your probe, so you are positive.
1592000	1608000	But in this case, because we are on both sides, we usually cut off the antenna signal and the probe signal. In this case, we generally think that when the antenna is far away, we simplify it as the oscillation of the position of the probe alone.
1608000	1621000	So we just said that the electrons ran away first, and the rest of the main positive on the probe, because of the negative number just mentioned, so it gets a feature of downward.
1621000	1634000	Then your ions are gone, and your probe is not so positive, so it is relatively negative. Negative plus a negative number, it becomes a positive, and then it comes down.
1635000	1645000	So in general, as long as you see a similar signal, in general, any beam probe in space, the signal of general dust is all like this.
1646000	1661000	This is a very complicated formula, mainly to tell us that when you have something hit your probe at the beginning, the thing that hits it will produce a charge because of the oil or electricity.
1661000	1669000	It is directly related to the quality and speed of the dust that hits it.
1670000	1677000	Next, because of the position of the probe, it may be positive or negative.
1678000	1688000	In contrast, your ions or electrons will be divided into those who have enough energy to escape, or those who are trapped on the surface.
1689000	1697000	Then we can get these different quantities and tell them that they are collected and stuck on it, or they can escape.
1697000	1706000	The charging equation will finally tell us which ones are on top, which ones are gone, and it is related to 1 over r decay.
1707000	1710000	There is also the so-called discharging, which is a very fun thing.
1711000	1717000	Discharging comes from the solar wind in the space environment, for example, when light hits, it produces a light-emitting effect and kicks out an electron.
1718000	1724000	Then your spacecraft will become positive, or the electron hits and is absorbed, and your spacecraft becomes negative.
1724000	1731000	So we will have a floating potential floating position in space, which is the meaning of this so-called discharging.
1732000	1740000	Finally, according to q is equal to cv conversion equation, we can get the floating picture of the position just now.
1741000	1753000	What we just talked about is the equation we came up with, and we found that the equation is the so-called red thing and the green experiment thing.
1754000	1760000	The so-called discharging feels pretty good, and it can provide us with some numbers or some information.
1761000	1774000	It tells us that after these impacts are collected, what are some of the characteristics of the electricity generation temperature, electron temperature and ion temperature?
1775000	1783000	Or after it produces the electron, how can it leave its speed or its background?
1784000	1791000	Because when we were experimenting, we knew the so-called position floating and we knew the speed of impact and mass.
1792000	1801000	So we can understand the following things, but on the other hand, in space, we actually don't know much about the above information.
1801000	1809000	So we are mainly from the following things, after you have finished, we can guess the position of the floating above.
1810000	1817000	Then according to our orbital mechanics calculation, we can guess that the speed of impact is about how much.
1818000	1827000	Then from the following data to rebut tell us that how much is the value of our dust?
1828000	1838000	So it is the so-called, we are generally talking about the measurement of the antenna instrument, it is similar to the supplementation or the measurement of a specific dedicated measurement.
1839000	1849000	Then we will think that we want to make a standard model, then you will find that this kind of thing looks like Sputnik, or it is very similar to the Pike solar propeller.
1849000	1858000	Because we want to know if it is hit in any place, its signal is the same, but we find that it is not the case.
1859000	1870000	So this is a top view, you will find that after the impact, if it corresponds to 45 degrees away from any antenna, you will find that it actually looks very similar.
1871000	1880000	That is, its signal may be almost the same, which is mainly what we said before, most of the reaction is on the probe, so it is caused by the probe charging.
1881000	1893000	But when we look to the right, we will find that if your impact is very close to a certain antenna, it will have a very special peak.
1894000	1903000	Then we think this is related to induced charging, because we have added this conductor antenna here, so we think it will affect this.
1904000	1908000	Then we think this is a very important reason, because the first thing you have to do is to make a box.
1909000	1917000	If this kind of thing just affects your box, in fact, the number of boxes here is not the real thing, it may actually be some fake things.
1917000	1929000	So we have to understand the location of the impact first, and then we can restore the real box process to get the real data hidden in it.
1930000	1937000	So the paper we are writing now is to tell you that we think we can simulate this situation.
1938000	1952000	That is to say, if you simplify what you just saw into a probe and an antenna, you will find that some of the boxes will be collected after the impact, and some will leave, as we just said.
1953000	1957000	Because they are not particles at all, they are electrons, so they are charged.
1957000	1967000	The charge will produce an electric field line, for example, at the beginning, when it is very close to the probe, it is all connected, slowly approaching the antenna.
1968000	1975000	It is actually closer to the antenna, which means it affects the antenna more, and then it slowly ends when it reaches infinity.
1975000	1989000	So when we simulate some of our problems, we can simulate some of this shape and tell people that, hey, actually, look, if this is an x-axis, it is a distance, and the y-axis is your location.
1990000	1998000	You will find that compared to this round probe, in fact, as long as your charge is away from it, it is a 1 over r decay.
1999000	2003000	That is, the further away you are from it, the less you feel its impact.
2004000	2008000	But the antenna is very strange, it comes out of this peak in the middle.
2009000	2014000	That's because at the beginning, the main thing that affects the charge particles is your probe.
2015000	2021000	But in the middle, your antenna is here, and it is more affected.
2021000	2031000	So you are in these two, because we measured the antenna, subtracted the spacecraft probe, you will get this particularly high peak in the middle.
2032000	2038000	That is to tell us that this is the reason, this is why we can get this peak.
2039000	2046000	So when we can simulate this situation, after the calculation of static electricity, we can go back and get those simulations.
2046000	2052000	So when we get those collision locations, we can start playing with all the probes in space.
2053000	2057000	For example, Cassini, or Stereo, this is for measuring the sun.
2058000	2063000	Or it's already far away from our ball shock, not ball shock, terminal shock.
2064000	2070000	It's already close to leaving our solar circle, the Voyager.
2070000	2075000	Or recently near the sun, the Parker Solar Probe, or the solar orbiter.
2076000	2078000	There was Wind and MMS earlier.
2079000	2083000	Then you will find that there seems to be something different.
2084000	2092000	If you cut it off here, we find that the reason why we are doing experiments is that these antennas are stuck on the side.
2093000	2095000	It's stuck with three of these antennas.
2096000	2098000	The signal it measures will be different.
2098000	2103000	That's a lot of trouble because it has something to do with some of the configurations on our circuit.
2104000	2107000	It's related to the C conductor between Q and CV.
2108000	2110000	That's what we're doing right now.
2111000	2116000	So you can imagine that when we have this method or technique,
2117000	2128000	We can measure from the inner solar system near the sun to 1AU, the so-called Stereo or Wind orbit around the Earth, or even MMS within the Earth's magnetic field.
2129000	2137000	Then all the way along, including Europa Clipper in Jupiter, Cassini in Saturn, or Voyager has left our solar circle all the way.
2138000	2150000	So after we have this method, we can analyze all the way from the inner solar system to the outer star Gaia, all the way to the outer solar system.
2151000	2156000	The distribution of our cosmic dust, or their orbit, or their source.
2157000	2163000	So to sum up, we're all sources of cosmic dust.
2163000	2171000	Of course, we know that we've heard of some space stuff, but we don't want to measure those ashes in outer space in the future.
2172000	2174000	But basically, these things are all dust.
2175000	2180000	The second thing is that the simulation we're doing right now and the model functions we're providing.
2181000	2189000	We found that it's actually a good way to analyze a signal of cosmic dust hitting your probe or antenna.
2189000	2197000	So with these things we provide, we can understand some of the hidden impact plasmas in the middle.
2198000	2204000	The inner characteristics of the impact probe to understand some of the temperature inside, its speed, its distribution.
2205000	2208000	And then after the application, we can get some impact locations.
2209000	2214000	And after we get these impact locations, we can find out where these dust comes from.
2214000	2222000	And then we can understand the characteristics of the location of that planet or the original dust, or its space environment.
2223000	2226000	And even some of the things that are measured on top may be organic.
2227000	2231000	So can they tell us some information about where our origin comes from?
2232000	2235000	Are we the only species in the universe?
2236000	2238000	So that's what we're doing right now.
2239000	2244000	Okay, I guess 40 minutes.
2247000	2249000	So, let's start the Q&A.
2250000	2254000	Is my microphone on? Okay, it's on.
2255000	2257000	The timing is just right.
2258000	2263000	Before we start the Q&A, let me give a warm round of applause to thank Mingxue for sharing with us today.
2264000	2269000	I personally think that the first part of the presentation was very precise.
2270000	2272000	The other part was very rich in content.
2273000	2275000	I tried my best to speak in Chinese.
2276000	2282000	All kinds of demonstrations and illustrations were very impressive.
2283000	2285000	Very clear.
2286000	2288000	Very good at explaining.
2289000	2291000	Very good at explaining.
2292000	2295000	Do you have any questions?
2296000	2300000	If you have any questions at this time, you can turn on the microphone and speak.
2301000	2307000	Before you speak, please tell us your name and affiliation so that we can get to know you better.
2311000	2313000	Hello, I'm Chengxin Da.
2314000	2315000	Can you hear me?
2315000	2317000	Hi, I'm Mingxue.
2318000	2320000	I'm a postdoc at UPenn Chemistry.
2321000	2322000	My name is Chengxin Da.
2323000	2325000	I have one last question.
2326000	2331000	You mentioned that you can analyze impact of a project.
2332000	2335000	Can you tell us where it comes from?
2336000	2337000	Yes.
2338000	2340000	That's a bit too...
2341000	2342000	That's a bit too...
2343000	2344000	That's a bit too far.
2345000	2350000	From the analysis of its composition,
2351000	2354000	I know you can know its mass and see if there's anything organic in it.
2355000	2357000	But how do you know where it comes from?
2358000	2359000	Okay, good.
2360000	2361000	First of all,
2362000	2364000	you can start by imagining if...
2364000	2368000	Let's say we launch a space shuttle from the Earth.
2369000	2371000	If you fly to the moon,
2372000	2375000	because first of all, any probe in any place,
2376000	2379000	we can basically calculate its orbit and speed.
2380000	2382000	After you know the orbit and speed,
2383000	2385000	if we can know the impact location,
2386000	2388000	we can probably know its origin and speed.
2389000	2390000	Right?
2391000	2393000	The first one is the origin and speed.
2394000	2396000	After the origin and speed,
2397000	2399000	we have a method to calculate the speed of escape.
2400000	2401000	So you can know the speed of escape.
2402000	2404000	You can know who might tie it up.
2405000	2406000	For example, is it tied up by the Earth?
2407000	2408000	Is it tied up by the Moon?
2409000	2410000	Or is it tied up by the Sun?
2411000	2412000	I think you can know...
2413000	2414000	For example,
2415000	2416000	your probe is between the Earth and the Moon,
2417000	2418000	so you can know where it comes from.
2419000	2420000	For example, if I fly to the Earth and the Moon,
2421000	2422000	I measure 8 km per second.
2422000	2424000	8 km per second is probably the escape speed of the Earth.
2425000	2428000	But it can't escape 30 km per second from the Sun.
2429000	2430000	At this time, we would say
2431000	2432000	it should be in the middle.
2433000	2435000	If you measure 5 km per second when you return to the Moon,
2436000	2437000	it won't be outside,
2438000	2440000	but the speed on the surface of the Earth.
2441000	2442000	It's about 2 km to 5 km.
2443000	2444000	So we can guess from here.
2445000	2447000	There's another one, like the Parker Solar Probe.
2448000	2449000	I can't show it,
2450000	2451000	but I can tell you that
2452000	2453000	when we measure,
2454000	2455000	we know that the closer we get to the Sun,
2456000	2457000	there will be a block,
2458000	2459000	that is, your impact will be higher and higher.
2460000	2461000	But when they...
2462000	2463000	In addition to the impact,
2464000	2465000	they found another unknown peak.
2466000	2467000	It's still being studied at the moment,
2468000	2469000	but they think that
2471000	2473000	in the measurement or non-passing process,
2474000	2475000	just at that time,
2476000	2477000	there was a comet passing by.
2478000	2479000	So they think it's related to the comet.
2480000	2481000	Yeah.
2482000	2484000	The comet is a dirty snowball.
2485000	2486000	There's water in it, and there's organic matter in it.
2487000	2488000	So we're always happy to say
2489000	2490000	that as long as the measurement is related to the comet,
2491000	2492000	will there be life in the universe?
2500000	2501000	So if we're talking about chemistry,
2502000	2503000	the latest thing we're going to do
2504000	2505000	is the Europa Clipper.
2506000	2507000	It's going to go to Jupiter.
2508000	2509000	If it used to be Cassini,
2510000	2511000	I'll zoom in for you.
2512000	2513000	If it used to be Cassini,
2514000	2515000	if it used to be Cassini,
2516000	2517000	oh, this is not zoom,
2518000	2519000	I can't draw this.
2520000	2521000	Wait a minute.
2522000	2523000	If it used to be Cassini,
2524000	2525000	its resolution would look like this.
2527000	2528000	OK.
2529000	2530000	Its resolution is really bad.
2531000	2532000	You probably know what it looks like.
2533000	2534000	But you don't know what's in the middle.
2535000	2536000	For example,
2537000	2538000	its isomers can't be seen.
2539000	2540000	Yeah.
2541000	2542000	But the latest one,
2543000	2544000	its resolution can be higher.
2545000	2546000	So we want to look at the middle,
2547000	2548000	especially some of the carbon dioxide compounds
2549000	2550000	to understand
2551000	2552000	if there's any life in it.
2562000	2563000	OK.
2564000	2565000	Does that answer your question?
2566000	2567000	Yes.
2568000	2569000	Very interesting.
2570000	2571000	OK.
2572000	2573000	Does anyone else have a question?
2574000	2575000	Or you can go ahead and ask.
2580000	2581000	Hello, I have a question.
2582000	2583000	OK.
2584000	2585000	Hi, I'm Zheng Yunting.
2586000	2588000	I'm a Ph.D. student at Caltech.
2589000	2590000	I do astronomy,
2590000	2591000	as well as cosmology.
2592000	2593000	I think your talk is quite interesting.
2594000	2595000	You see,
2596000	2597000	these things are
2598000	2599000	foreground for us.
2600000	2601000	We don't want them.
2604000	2605000	I have two questions.
2606000	2607000	The first one is
2608000	2609000	I want to know
2610000	2611000	how much
2612000	2613000	the rate of
2614000	2615000	cosmic dust
2616000	2617000	is in
2618000	2619000	Cassini.
2620000	2621000	Is it like
2622000	2623000	tens of thousands per second
2624000	2625000	or a few seconds per second?
2626000	2627000	We can say a few tens of minutes.
2629000	2630000	Sorry?
2632000	2633000	We usually say
2634000	2635000	a few tens of minutes.
2636000	2637000	A few tens of minutes?
2638000	2639000	Yeah.
2640000	2641000	If you want to get close to the sun,
2642000	2643000	at the nearest point,
2644000	2645000	at 340 solar radii,
2646000	2647000	that's 20 minutes per second.
2647000	2648000	As far as I know,
2649000	2650000	the New Horizons
2651000	2652000	is
2653000	2654000	I don't know if there's one per week.
2656000	2657000	That's the current rate.
2659000	2660000	But if you're talking about
2661000	2662000	Cassini
2663000	2664000	in Enceladus,
2665000	2666000	where it flies through the ice,
2667000	2668000	it's saturated.
2669000	2670000	It's like
2671000	2672000	a hundred or a thousand per minute.
2673000	2674000	So,
2674000	2675000	it's like
2676000	2677000	a hundred or a thousand per minute.
2679000	2680000	In this kind of place,
2681000	2682000	it's hard to measure
2683000	2684000	because the whole instrument is overloaded.
2685000	2686000	OK.
2687000	2688000	What if it's
2689000	2690000	outside of Mars?
2691000	2692000	What's that called?
2693000	2694000	The small star belt?
2695000	2696000	The small star belt is usually
2700000	2701000	If this is a small
2701000	2702000	Oh, the small star belt rate.
2703000	2704000	I'm not sure about this.
2705000	2706000	But
2708000	2709000	if you can get close to
2710000	2711000	these sources,
2712000	2713000	it should be pretty high.
2714000	2715000	But other than that,
2716000	2717000	if it's in a general empty space,
2718000	2719000	it's a few dozen minutes.
2720000	2721000	OK, OK.
2722000	2723000	Got it.
2724000	2726000	And my other question is
2727000	2728000	if you have
2728000	2729000	if you have
2730000	2731000	If your detector
2732000	2733000	is hit by Cosmic Ray,
2734000	2735000	will it affect it?
2736000	2737000	OK.
2738000	2739000	Good question.
2740000	2741000	If it's an antenna device,
2742000	2743000	it won't.
2744000	2745000	But if it's this kind of PVDF,
2746000	2747000	it will.
2748000	2749000	Because this kind of thing
2750000	2751000	for high-capacity ions
2752000	2753000	or even for temperature control,
2754000	2755000	it's going to give you a wrong signal.
2755000	2756000	But for a PVDF detector,
2757000	2758000	it will.
2759000	2760000	In this case,
2761000	2762000	if it's what we just talked about,
2763000	2764000	these two on the left,
2765000	2766000	this kind of dedicated dust analyzer,
2767000	2768000	UV will also be affected.
2769000	2770000	So it can't measure directly in front of UV.
2771000	2772000	It's usually sublim.
2773000	2774000	It's about 30 degrees to 45 degrees.
2775000	2776000	You can start measuring
2777000	2778000	to all the back sides can be measured.
2779000	2780000	But you can't go to the sun.
2781000	2782000	There's a problem with the sun.
2783000	2784000	Because it's got MCP
2785000	2786000	Yeah, that's a good question.
2787000	2788000	As for the antenna measurement we just talked about,
2789000	2790000	because this kind of thing
2791000	2792000	is something that can be hit.
2793000	2794000	There's no difference in UV.
2796000	2797000	OK, OK.
2798000	2799000	What if you look at the stars
2800000	2801000	and then reflect the light of the sun?
2802000	2803000	Will the UV be too strong?
2806000	2807000	Stars reflect UV?
2808000	2809000	Generally, it won't.
2810000	2811000	Because in general,
2812000	2813000	albedo,
2813000	2814000	what we usually hear is no.
2815000	2816000	It's not that exaggerated.
2817000	2818000	OK, OK.
2819000	2820000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2821000	2822000	OK, thank you.
2823000	2824000	You're welcome.
2825000	2826000	I know you guys,
2827000	2828000	there's a picture that looks like
2829000	2830000	something like that,
2831000	2832000	that size,
2833000	2834000	and then it goes down like this.
2835000	2836000	And then the lower part is the bigger star
2837000	2838000	or that kind of star.
2839000	2840000	And then in the middle is a small star.
2841000	2842000	And then the upper left corner is dust.
2843000	2844000	Is this albedo?
2845000	2846000	No, no, no.
2847000	2848000	In astronomy, when you measure,
2849000	2850000	you usually measure the bigger the better.
2851000	2852000	We measure where we don't want
2853000	2854000	the smaller the better.
2855000	2856000	Oh.
2857000	2858000	Yeah.
2859000	2860000	Because our experiment,
2861000	2862000	Zodiacal Light
2863000	2864000	is our biggest experiment.
2865000	2866000	Because we measure
2867000	2870000	near-infrared wavelengths.
2870000	2871000	And our main wavelengths
2872000	2873000	are actually
2874000	2875000	the reflections
2876000	2877000	of small stars nearby.
2878000	2879000	Yeah.
2881000	2882000	Got it.
2891000	2892000	OK.
2893000	2894000	Can I ask a question?
2895000	2896000	Sure, go ahead.
2897000	2899000	I don't know if this question
2900000	2901000	sounds unprofessional.
2902000	2903000	But when you were drawing
2904000	2905000	the rotation angle,
2906000	2907000	what did you say?
2908000	2909000	If the two antennae are in the middle
2910000	2911000	at 45 degrees,
2912000	2913000	it will look like this.
2914000	2915000	But if you put it on the antenna
2916000	2917000	from time to time,
2918000	2919000	it will look like this, right?
2920000	2921000	Yes.
2922000	2923000	OK.
2924000	2925000	That's the picture, right?
2926000	2927000	OK.
2928000	2929000	I was thinking
2930000	2931000	about the frequency problem.
2932000	2933000	It doesn't sound good
2934000	2935000	for two weeks.
2936000	2937000	But if today
2938000	2939000	it's a stable beam,
2940000	2941000	it's not one thing,
2942000	2943000	it's a beam,
2944000	2945000	and we assume it's a stable frequency.
2946000	2947000	At this time,
2948000	2949000	because we know
2950000	2951000	the rotation of the detector,
2952000	2953000	because the rotation
2954000	2955000	is on our machine,
2956000	2957000	we can record it.
2957000	2958000	Of course, there is an assumption
2959000	2960000	that the direction of the beam
2961000	2962000	is fixed.
2963000	2964000	In this case,
2965000	2966000	for example,
2967000	2968000	the first one looks like this on the left,
2969000	2970000	and the second one
2971000	2972000	has a different angle,
2973000	2974000	and it looks more and more
2975000	2976000	like the picture on the right.
2977000	2978000	When it hits the antenna,
2979000	2980000	it becomes the picture on the right,
2981000	2982000	and when it leaves the antenna,
2983000	2984000	it becomes the picture on the left.
2985000	2986000	There is an oscillation
2987000	2988000	that can be solved.
2989000	2990000	In other words,
2991000	2992000	it can be solved
2993000	2994000	what kind of frequency
2995000	2996000	it is now.
2997000	2998000	The first thing to know
2999000	3000000	is the frequency.
3001000	3002000	But the frequency knows
3003000	3004000	because it knows the frequency
3005000	3006000	every time it pauses.
3007000	3008000	So you can take this parameter
3009000	3010000	and use it.
3011000	3012000	But this is something
3013000	3014000	that needs a stable flow.
3015000	3016000	Can you do this?
3017000	3018000	I think I deleted something
3019000	3020000	and missed to tell you.
3021000	3022000	When we were doing the experiment,
3023000	3024000	we measured where the collision was.
3025000	3026000	There are 10 degrees, 30 degrees,
3027000	3028000	45 degrees, 60 degrees,
3029000	3030000	and then we went around like this.
3031000	3032000	So we measured a lot of things.
3033000	3034000	Of course,
3035000	3036000	for example, this is 10 degrees,
3037000	3038000	and 30 degrees may be in the middle.
3039000	3040000	Yes, yes, yes.
3041000	3042000	Yes.
3043000	3044000	What you just said is right.
3045000	3046000	When we do measurements,
3047000	3048000	generally speaking,
3049000	3050000	the main probe in space
3051000	3052000	is actually not fixed.
3053000	3054000	It's best to let it choose.
3055000	3056000	There is a frequency to choose.
3057000	3058000	Our attitude control system
3059000	3060000	will know its angle of rotation.
3061000	3062000	If you say today,
3063000	3064000	for example,
3065000	3066000	let's say we encounter
3067000	3068000	an Enceladus.
3069000	3070000	This is the one that keeps spraying ice.
3071000	3072000	It has a fixed
3073000	3074000	time rate.
3075000	3076000	OK,
3077000	3078000	what you want to talk about is this, right?
3079000	3080000	Yes, yes, yes.
3082000	3083000	You really know how to explain things.
3084000	3085000	After going around like this,
3086000	3087000	you will find that
3088000	3089000	if the original signal
3090000	3091000	is red,
3092000	3093000	you will see the blue signal
3094000	3095000	going up and down.
3096000	3097000	This is what you want to talk about, right?
3098000	3099000	Yes, yes, yes.
3100000	3101000	Yes, yes.
3102000	3103000	In this case,
3104000	3105000	we generally believe
3105000	3106000	our attitude control system.
3107000	3108000	In this case, it's really interesting.
3109000	3110000	We must believe
3111000	3112000	our attitude control system is correct.
3113000	3114000	So if our attitude control system is correct,
3115000	3116000	we can know that
3117000	3118000	suppose I want to change a color today.
3119000	3120000	Then I set it as the
3121000	3122000	pointing direction.
3123000	3124000	I might have known at the beginning
3125000	3126000	that my pointing is like this.
3127000	3128000	I think my first antenna points there.
3129000	3130000	The second antenna points there.
3131000	3132000	You will rotate like this, right?
3132000	3133000	Yes.
3134000	3135000	In this case,
3136000	3137000	we can solve the location of the collision.
3138000	3139000	But I have to say
3140000	3141000	there is a drawback in this case.
3142000	3143000	The first drawback is
3144000	3145000	our probe
3146000	3147000	will never be as beautiful
3148000	3149000	as this sphere.
3150000	3151000	This is the first one.
3152000	3153000	The second one,
3154000	3155000	even if this sphere
3156000	3157000	I draw a big probe now.
3158000	3159000	The middle one is called
3160000	3161000	your antenna.
3162000	3163000	I will face it directly at the top.
3164000	3165000	There is a drawback in this case.
3166000	3167000	You know its angle.
3168000	3169000	It's the distance
3170000	3171000	between you and it.
3172000	3173000	But the distance is
3174000	3175000	similar to the distance of a copper core.
3176000	3177000	Right?
3178000	3179000	You don't know
3180000	3181000	the distance.
3182000	3183000	If the distance is so close
3184000	3185000	and it's a perfectly fixed sphere,
3186000	3187000	the signal here
3188000	3189000	and here
3190000	3191000	look like this.
3192000	3193000	The distance is there.
3194000	3195000	You don't know if it's here
3196000	3197000	or here or there.
3198000	3199000	So we need to
3200000	3201000	develop a new model
3202000	3203000	or think about how to explain it.
3204000	3205000	It needs to be improved.
3206000	3207000	OK.
3208000	3209000	I just thought of another one.
3210000	3211000	Can't we just
3212000	3213000	hit the earth
3214000	3215000	and build the model first?
3216000	3217000	That's right.
3218000	3219000	So now we have a model
3220000	3221000	like the Pyke Solar Probe.
3222000	3223000	Cassini made a model.
3224000	3225000	This is a 20 to 1 model.
3226000	3227000	It's exactly the same.
3229000	3230000	So we later said
3231000	3232000	we have this model.
3233000	3235000	We have this physical model.
3236000	3237000	This doesn't seem right.
3238000	3239000	I mean
3240000	3241000	there is a formula for the physical model.
3242000	3243000	After we have this,
3244000	3245000	we take a physical model
3246000	3247000	which is also called physical model in English.
3248000	3249000	Laboratory model
3249000	3250000	to do this kind of simulation
3251000	3252000	of hitting the earth.
3253000	3254000	Then put the two together.
3255000	3256000	We just want to tell people
3257000	3258000	who wants to launch a thing with an antenna.
3259000	3260000	We can make a model
3261000	3262000	and then do this kind of simulation.
3263000	3264000	After knowing all the parameters,
3265000	3266000	when you get to the sky,
3267000	3268000	you are facing these databases
3269000	3270000	to correspond.
3271000	3272000	Then it's accurate.
3273000	3274000	Yes.
3275000	3276000	Got it.
3277000	3278000	Good question.
3280000	3281000	Any other questions?
3298000	3299000	You can ask anything.
3300000	3301000	If you don't want to ask about the universe dust,
3302000	3303000	you can ask about the electromagnetic dust.
3304000	3305000	Or you can ask about the particle promoter.
3306000	3307000	Since you mentioned it,
3308000	3309000	let me ask.
3310000	3311000	Why did you decide to
3312000	3313000	make an antenna?
3314000	3315000	Because the particle promoter
3316000	3317000	is a bit far away.
3318000	3319000	But it doesn't seem impossible.
3320000	3321000	It can't be done.
3323000	3324000	First,
3325000	3326000	in the US,
3327000	3328000	you can't make a promoter.
3329000	3330000	Second,
3331000	3332000	everyone knows
3332000	3333000	who gives you money,
3334000	3335000	just do it.
3337000	3338000	You said you can't make a promoter in the US?
3339000	3340000	What do you mean by that?
3341000	3342000	I don't know.
3343000	3344000	What does it mean?
3345000	3346000	As long as you come across
3347000	3348000	defense or military industry,
3349000	3350000	you can't do it.
3351000	3352000	Even if you are a foreigner in Taiwan,
3353000	3354000	you can't do it.
3355000	3356000	You can't do it as a foreigner.
3358000	3359000	Let's be official and scientific.
3360000	3361000	After I made the particle engine,
3362000	3363000	the particle engine
3364000	3365000	is related to the space environment.
3366000	3367000	In the space environment,
3368000	3369000	in addition to electromagnetic waves,
3370000	3371000	matter will collide.
3372000	3373000	So we need to make some cosmic things.
3374000	3375000	You can also understand the origin of your life,
3376000	3377000	right?
3378000	3379000	That makes sense.
3392000	3393000	Do you have any questions?
3394000	3395000	Let me see.
3396000	3397000	We are waiting
3399000	3400000	for one minute.
3401000	3402000	If you don't have any questions,
3403000	3404000	I'll end the recording.
3405000	3406000	Someone wants to ask a question
3407000	3408000	but doesn't want to be recorded.
3409000	3410000	You can ask after we're done.
3411000	3412000	I mean we'll end the recording
3413000	3414000	after one minute.
3452000	3453000	No problem.
3461000	3462000	Okay.
3462000	3463000	One minute is up.
3463000	3464000	On behalf of everyone,
3464000	3465000	let's give Mingxue
3465000	3466000	a big round of applause
3466000	3467000	before we end the recording.
