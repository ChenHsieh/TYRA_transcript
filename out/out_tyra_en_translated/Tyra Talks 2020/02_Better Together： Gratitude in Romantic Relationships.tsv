0	9000	Hello, everyone. I'm your host, Sui-An.
9000	16000	I'm very happy to have you all here today.
16000	21000	I'm very happy to have you all here today.
21000	25000	The topic is Better Together, Gratitude in Romantic Relationships.
25000	29000	Before we start, I'd like to talk about two things.
29000	34000	First, I'd like to briefly talk about how we're going to do the presentation.
34000	39000	Dr. Zhang will have a few segments in the presentation.
39000	45000	If you have any questions, you can leave them in the chat box.
45000	52000	Or during the presentation, the speaker may pause a few times.
52000	55000	You can ask questions during that time.
55000	65000	During the presentation, because we're live, I'm going to mute everyone's microphones.
65000	67000	Please understand.
67000	71000	Today's presentation is hosted by TAIRA.
71000	73000	TAIRA is a non-profit organization.
73000	78000	We hope that young Taiwanese scholars all over the world
78000	81000	will have the opportunity to share their research online.
81000	84000	Whether you're in the same field or in a different field,
84000	87000	you'll have the opportunity to discuss and learn from each other.
87000	91000	If you're not a TAIRA member yet,
91000	99000	please go to the TAIRA Project website to sign up to become a member.
99000	101000	If you're already a member,
101000	104000	we're recruiting speakers for the second half of this year.
104000	109000	Please feel free to register to become a speaker for the second half of this year.
109000	115000	This is the agenda for today's presentation.
115000	120000	I'm going to briefly introduce Dr. Zhang's academic experience.
120000	125000	Dr. Zhang currently serves as a post-doctoral postdoc researcher
125000	127000	at the Central Institute of Sociology.
127000	130000	Her current research project is called
130000	134000	Unmanned Mobility-Affected Experimental Situations.
134000	137000	Her main field of research is psychology.
137000	141000	Her research topics include emotions, interpersonal relationships, and culture.
141000	145000	Before she returned to Taiwan to serve as a post-doctoral postdoc researcher,
145000	148000	she graduated from the Department of Psychology at the National Taiwan University
148000	149000	and obtained a bachelor's degree.
149000	152000	She then continued to study at the National Taiwan University Psychological Research Institute
152000	153000	and obtained a master's degree.
153000	158000	The topic of her master's thesis is actually a continuation of today's topic.
158000	161000	Her topic is how to express gratitude and adapt to a partner's lifestyle.
161000	163000	After graduating from her master's,
163000	166000	she went straight to the University of North Carolina in the United States
166000	169000	to study for a doctorate degree at the University of North Carolina.
169000	172000	I find her research topics very interesting.
172000	175000	There are several main parts.
175000	180000	For example, if we express gratitude in our daily lives,
180000	184000	does it mean that people from different cultures have different cultural differences?
184000	190000	Or, can gratitude make us a better person, a better version of ourselves?
191000	195000	Or, if we talk about intimate relationships,
195000	200000	what kind of role do partners play in intimate relationships or physical contact?
200000	205000	Another part is the so-called self-exceeding emotion.
205000	212000	What does it have to do with a person's participation in society?
212000	216000	I find Dr. Zhang's research very interesting.
216000	219000	What's interesting is that it's not a research in a ivory tower,
219000	223000	but rather how we can apply theory in our daily lives
223000	227000	to make psychology a very practical and helpful science for humans.
227000	232000	Before I hand over to Dr. Zhang,
232000	235000	I have a personal story to share with you.
235000	241000	Dr. Zhang is a very important mentor who led me into the field of psychology.
241000	244000	When I was in college, I was his research assistant.
244000	248000	I think Dr. Zhang is someone who cares a lot about humans.
248000	253000	I think his research is not just about knowledge.
253000	260000	He really cares about how we can make humans a better human being.
260000	263000	So, I won't go into too much detail.
263000	268000	Let's welcome Dr. Zhang to share his useful speech with us.
268000	271000	Thank you.
271000	274000	Thank you, Yian, for the introduction.
274000	277000	It was a very complete speech.
277000	283000	I feel like I wasn't as serious as I was when I was a host last week.
283000	285000	Thank you very much.
285000	290000	Let's get started.
290000	294000	The topic of Yian's speech,
294000	296000	Gradually Romantic Relationships,
296000	297000	was written by me.
297000	298000	That's right.
298000	301000	You can see it on PowerPoint.
302000	305000	If there is an emergency,
305000	306000	let me talk about it first.
306000	308000	If there is an emergency,
308000	314000	like if I suddenly lose connection or can't see the slides or something,
314000	316000	but I can't see everyone's chat,
316000	319000	Yian, please send me a message.
319000	321000	My phone is next to me.
321000	322000	You can still see it.
322000	325000	If there is something like this, please let me know.
325000	327000	All right.
327000	329000	I wrote the topic myself.
330000	333000	What you see on PowerPoint now
333000	336000	is purely because the word romantic is too long.
336000	338000	It will squeeze the relationship to the next line.
338000	341000	I think it's ugly, so I changed it.
341000	348000	But most of today's content will still be in Romantic Relationships.
348000	351000	Although it's not just Romantic Relationships,
351000	353000	most of it will be here.
353000	354000	This is the first one.
354000	357000	The second one is
358000	360000	I don't have much content to prepare today.
360000	362000	So if you're in the middle,
362000	366000	is there anything you want to clarify?
366000	368000	Or I didn't make it clear.
368000	369000	Then you need to clarify.
369000	373000	Or is there anything you want to discuss?
373000	374000	Some ideas.
374000	377000	In fact, I welcome everyone to put it out in the middle.
377000	378000	As for the method,
378000	380000	Yian has already introduced it.
380000	382000	So you can put it out.
382000	383000	If we have a chance,
383000	386000	we can discuss it.
387000	390000	The third one is what Yian just said.
390000	392000	Like my master's thesis.
392000	395000	It's true that the content I'm going to talk about today
395000	398000	is what I've been doing all the way.
398000	400000	But I'm not going to talk about that today.
400000	403000	There are some other related studies.
403000	405000	But I welcome everyone to ask questions.
405000	408000	We may be able to talk about these past studies
408000	410000	during the time of questions.
410000	416000	I'm going to focus on a few new ones today.
416000	421000	And then we're actually halfway there.
421000	423000	The reason is because I don't want to...
423000	426000	Because I don't know if you've heard of my previous stuff.
426000	428000	I'm afraid I'll repeat it later.
428000	429000	It's a waste of time.
429000	430000	But if you don't know,
430000	432000	you're welcome to ask questions.
432000	435000	Then we can mention it by the way.
435000	441000	Okay, let's get started.
441000	445000	Okay, I'm going to talk a little slower now.
445000	448000	As Yian just said,
448000	452000	a large part of my research all the way
452000	456000	is about the feeling of gratitude.
456000	458000	In interpersonal relationships,
458000	460000	especially in intimate relationships,
460000	463000	there's a lot of influence
463000	465000	between people who are close to each other.
465000	467000	This kind of emotion,
467000	469000	which we usually call emotion,
469000	475000	is generated from intimacy
475000	476000	and how it can be reversed
476000	481000	to influence the quality of intimacy, etc.
481000	483000	In literature,
483000	487000	there is a major theory
487000	490000	that talks about the function of gratitude
490000	494000	in interpersonal relationships and intimacy.
494000	496000	From a functionalist perspective,
496000	498000	we're going to talk about its function.
498000	501000	The conclusion of this theory is actually quite simple.
501000	504000	Gratitude is...
504000	505000	The function of its evolution
505000	507000	is to help us promote
507000	515000	and maintain high-quality intimacy.
515000	517000	To be more specific,
517000	520000	this is how it works.
520000	522000	Let's imagine that
522000	525000	we're walking around like this in our daily lives.
525000	527000	Suddenly, one day,
527000	529000	at a certain moment,
529000	530000	a person,
530000	531000	no matter who it is,
531000	532000	a stranger, a close person,
532000	533000	anyone,
533000	537000	did something to us
537000	541000	that is worth praising.
541000	542000	For example,
542000	544000	today,
544000	546000	I forgot to bring my keys.
546000	547000	I forgot to bring my keys.
547000	551000	Then I called my wife.
551000	552000	She said,
552000	553000	wait for me.
553000	554000	I'm nearby.
554000	556000	I'll send your keys back.
556000	558000	She did this for me.
558000	559000	For me,
559000	561000	it's very...
561000	562000	In terms of evolution...
562000	563000	No, let's not talk about evolution.
563000	564000	For my life,
564000	566000	it's very useful.
566000	570000	It's a very effective thing.
570000	571000	In terms of evolution,
571000	572000	of course,
572000	574000	as an individual,
574000	579000	how can we recognize
579000	580000	that these people
580000	583000	will do something effective, useful, and helpful to us?
583000	584000	Some people won't.
584000	586000	We need to interact with these people for a long time.
586000	589000	Don't interact with another group of people for a long time.
589000	591000	This ability becomes very important,
591000	592000	very functional,
592000	594000	and very effective.
594000	597000	This is why gratitude appears.
597000	598000	Let's say my wife
598000	600000	brought my keys back today.
600000	601000	She just went out
601000	603000	and brought my keys back.
603000	607000	Then I'll have this emotion.
607000	609000	The emotion of gratitude.
609000	610000	It's a bit like
610000	613000	there's a light bulb in my head.
613000	615000	Then it lights up.
615000	619000	That light bulb is the feeling of gratitude.
619000	622000	It reminds me
622000	626000	that the person I'm interacting with
626000	628000	is a good social partner.
628000	630000	He is a person
630000	632000	who needs to interact well
632000	638000	in my future life.
638000	639000	This is the first step.
639000	640000	Okay?
640000	643000	My feeling of gratitude.
643000	645000	But just the feeling is not enough.
645000	647000	What I just said is important.
647000	648000	How do I fix this person
648000	650000	in my future?
650000	652000	So gratitude
652000	654000	will be very natural.
654000	656000	Everyone must have experience like this.
656000	658000	The feeling of gratitude
658000	660000	will naturally
660000	663000	produce a grateful expression.
663000	665000	For example, the simplest
665000	666000	I would say thank you.
666000	669000	This is a very natural expression.
669000	670000	Of course, everyone can think of
670000	673000	many different ways of expression.
673000	675000	This is what I just mentioned.
675000	677000	When I was doing cultural research,
677000	680000	I was doing cultural psychology research.
680000	682000	Cultural research is another
682000	685000	huge field.
685000	688000	So I'm not doing all of it.
688000	689000	When I was doing cultural psychology research,
689000	690000	I was looking at
690000	692000	people from different cultures
692000	695000	expressing their feelings of gratitude.
695000	697000	But no matter which culture it is,
697000	698000	no matter how it is expressed,
698000	700000	it is expressed anyway.
700000	703000	Through this expression,
703000	705000	what I want to do is
705000	708000	let my wife
708000	709000	know that
709000	711000	I am a person
711000	714000	who knows how to be grateful.
714000	715000	I feel it.
715000	717000	I let her know.
717000	720000	This is very important
720000	722000	because it will let my
722000	724000	social partner know
724000	725000	that this person
725000	728000	is a person who knows how to be grateful.
728000	731000	So she can recognize
731000	734000	that I am working hard for her.
734000	736000	My efforts for her
736000	738000	will not be in vain.
738000	740000	In the future,
740000	742000	she will want to
742000	744000	interact with me
744000	746000	in theory.
746000	748000	This is still theory.
748000	750000	She will want to interact with me.
750000	753000	Then we can form a...
753000	756000	I don't know if this example is good or not.
756000	757000	But you can imagine
757000	759000	that there are two atoms
759000	760000	and they are far apart.
760000	761000	It doesn't matter.
761000	763000	But slowly they will
763000	764000	get closer and closer
764000	767000	to each other.
767000	769000	Then they will be fixed
769000	771000	as a pair.
771000	772000	This is the concept.
772000	775000	Then they will be fixed.
775000	777000	This kind of pair
777000	780000	will help a lot
780000	783000	when facing
783000	785000	the risk of evolution,
785000	787000	environmental challenges, etc.
787000	791000	This is the phenomenal level.
791000	795000	On the psychological level,
795000	797000	there is a very important concept
797000	800000	in the literature.
800000	801000	It is used to...
801000	803000	It is a very strong concept
803000	805000	that predicts the quality of the relationship
805000	808000	and maintains it.
808000	809000	It is called
809000	811000	Perceived Partner Responsiveness.
811000	812000	TPRM.
812000	814000	How to translate this?
814000	815000	Actually, I'm not sure
815000	816000	how to translate this.
816000	820000	Perceived Partner Responsiveness.
820000	821000	What does this mean?
821000	822000	Let's talk about the first two words.
822000	823000	It's simple.
823000	824000	Perceived Partner.
824000	825000	I see a characteristic
825000	826000	in my partner.
826000	828000	This characteristic
828000	829000	is called
829000	833000	Perceived Responsiveness.
833000	835000	As a person,
835000	836000	I see this characteristic
836000	838000	in my partner.
838000	839000	The first two words,
839000	840000	Perceived Partner.
840000	842000	Something perceiving the partner.
842000	845000	What is Responsiveness?
845000	848000	Responsiveness is
849000	850000	my partner.
850000	852000	I see that my partner
852000	856000	wants to take care of me.
856000	858000	He wants to meet my expectations
858000	861000	and needs.
861000	863000	This motivation
863000	865000	is called Responsiveness.
865000	867000	If I see
867000	869000	a quality in my partner
869000	871000	that wants to take care of me,
871000	873000	then I perceive
873000	876000	some responsiveness in my partner.
876000	877000	This is it.
877000	879000	This is my subjective
879000	881000	perception of my partner.
881000	882000	What kind of person
882000	883000	is my partner?
883000	886000	This is my subjective perception.
886000	889000	This perception
889000	891000	can be found to be
891000	893000	a strong factor
893000	895000	in maintaining and stabilizing
895000	901000	the relationship.
901000	902000	So,
902000	903000	on a psychological level,
904000	907000	the expression of Gratitude
907000	909000	conveys
912000	916000	the feeling of Gratitude.
916000	917000	As I said,
917000	918000	the feeling of Gratitude
918000	919000	is to let me know
919000	920000	that my partner
920000	922000	is a good social partner.
922000	923000	Specifically,
923000	924000	what kind of partner is it?
924000	927000	It's a Responsive partner.
927000	928000	The feeling of Gratitude
928000	930000	is like
930000	932000	when you book online shopping.
932000	934000	When you book online shopping,
934000	936000	a box will be sent to your home.
936000	937000	The box is Gratitude.
937000	938000	When you open the box,
938000	940000	it's filled with Responsiveness.
940000	942000	It's like a carrier.
942000	943000	When you open the box,
943000	944000	you can see
944000	946000	the Responsiveness of your partner.
946000	947000	On the other hand,
947000	950000	the feeling of Gratitude
950000	951000	when we show it
951000	953000	to our partner,
953000	955000	it's the feeling of Gratitude.
955000	956000	However,
956000	957000	when the box is opened,
957000	959000	it's also the feeling of Responsiveness.
959000	964000	Through the exchange of Responsiveness,
964000	968000	the relationship stabilizes.
968000	969000	So,
969000	971000	I'm going to talk about some...
971000	972000	This is the theory part.
972000	973000	I'm going to talk about some
973000	974000	real-life research
974000	976000	to support this theory.
976000	977000	By the way,
977000	978000	I don't have a lot of videos.
978000	979000	It's usually like this.
979000	980000	I stop for a night
980000	981000	and then I keep talking.
981000	983000	So if you want this,
983000	984000	for example,
984000	985000	a citation
985000	988000	or related information,
988000	991000	you can ask me in person.
991000	993000	No problem.
993000	994000	Okay.
994000	995000	There is a research
995000	997000	that is done like this.
997000	1000000	I don't know if you know
1000000	1003000	the structure of
1003000	1007000	the American University Sisters' Association.
1007000	1010000	In the first week
1010000	1012000	of their freshman year,
1012000	1015000	at least in Virginia,
1015000	1017000	in the first week of their freshman year,
1017000	1020000	at the American University Sisters' Association,
1020000	1021000	the little sister,
1021000	1022000	the freshman,
1022000	1025000	will be assigned
1025000	1029000	to a big sister,
1029000	1030000	for example,
1030000	1031000	a sophomore,
1031000	1034000	a sophomore in college.
1034000	1035000	But
1035000	1037000	these sophomore students
1037000	1038000	are responsible for
1038000	1042000	taking care of their little sister.
1042000	1043000	But
1043000	1044000	the funny thing is
1044000	1046000	that the first week
1046000	1047000	is anonymous.
1047000	1048000	So the little sister
1048000	1049000	actually doesn't know
1049000	1050000	who their big sister is.
1050000	1051000	Only their big sister
1051000	1053000	has to take care of her
1053000	1055000	little sister in silence.
1055000	1058000	It's like the Little Angels.
1058000	1059000	This is the first week.
1059000	1060000	Then,
1060000	1061000	after the first week,
1061000	1064000	there is an opening speech.
1064000	1065000	It's like,
1065000	1068000	who is your big sister?
1068000	1069000	Then
1069000	1071000	they will become
1071000	1073000	a pair.
1073000	1074000	This research
1074000	1076000	uses this opportunity.
1076000	1077000	I'm going to talk about this research now.
1077000	1078000	This opportunity
1078000	1081000	during the first week
1081000	1084000	to ask these little sisters,
1084000	1086000	how much do you think
1086000	1088000	your big sister
1088000	1089000	takes care of you?
1089000	1091000	How grateful are you to her?
1091000	1092000	Even though you don't know who she is,
1092000	1094000	how grateful are you to her?
1094000	1096000	How much do you think she takes care of you?
1096000	1097000	These two phenomena,
1097000	1099000	one is the feeling of gratitude,
1099000	1101000	the other is
1101000	1103000	perceived responsiveness.
1103000	1106000	Then they measure this thing.
1106000	1107000	Then,
1107000	1109000	they use this thing to predict
1109000	1111000	and reveal
1111000	1113000	who your big sister is.
1113000	1115000	Who are the big sisters of these little friends?
1115000	1117000	After a month,
1117000	1120000	the satisfaction of the relationship between the two parties.
1120000	1122000	Then he found
1122000	1124000	in the first week,
1124000	1127000	the gratitude of the little sister
1127000	1129000	will predict
1129000	1132000	two people after a month.
1132000	1134000	Two people are
1134000	1136000	satisfied with the relationship between the two of them.
1136000	1138000	Then this degree is
1138000	1140000	the first week
1140000	1144000	little sister's perceived responsiveness
1144000	1147000	to terminate.
1147000	1150000	This is a
1150000	1152000	display of
1152000	1154000	gratitude can predict
1154000	1157000	subjective evaluation of the relationship,
1157000	1158000	stability,
1158000	1160000	some degree of stability indicators,
1160000	1162000	and is a long-term effect of a
1162000	1164000	related study.
1166000	1168000	In terms of intimacy,
1168000	1170000	there is another study,
1170000	1172000	which is very similar.
1172000	1174000	He asked the recipient
1174000	1176000	every day,
1176000	1178000	I remember it was 28 days,
1178000	1180000	3 weeks,
1180000	1182000	3 weeks,
1182000	1184000	21 days,
1184000	1186000	every day,
1186000	1188000	he asked the recipient to answer
1188000	1190000	gratitude,
1190000	1192000	did he express gratitude to you?
1192000	1194000	Did he express gratitude to you?
1194000	1196000	Did he express gratitude to you?
1196000	1198000	How grateful are you
1198000	1200000	to him?
1200000	1202000	Then
1202000	1204000	thank you?
1204000	1206000	This degree is a
1206000	1208000	display.
1208000	1210000	Finally,
1210000	1212000	how committed are you
1212000	1214000	to the relationship?
1214000	1216000	That is to say,
1216000	1218000	this is called loyalty.
1218000	1220000	I think loyalty is a bit strange.
1220000	1222000	How serious are you?
1222000	1224000	How convinced are you of this relationship?
1224000	1226000	Then put in this way.
1226000	1228000	Then you can imagine,
1228000	1230000	because it is a long-term
1230000	1232000	study of 21 days,
1232000	1234000	so every day,
1234000	1236000	if the data is drawn,
1236000	1238000	there will be ups and downs,
1238000	1240000	high and low.
1240000	1242000	So to some extent,
1242000	1244000	this study is actually a bit like
1244000	1246000	an experiment,
1246000	1248000	or what we usually call a type experiment.
1248000	1250000	Because if one day I write high,
1250000	1252000	that is, I am in the high
1252000	1254000	experimental group,
1254000	1256000	and then one day I write low,
1256000	1258000	that is, I am now in the low experimental group,
1258000	1260000	high, low, high, low,
1260000	1262000	I will have
1262000	1264000	all kinds of experimental situations.
1264000	1266000	Everyone can imagine this way.
1266000	1268000	So to some extent it is a bit like a type experiment.
1268000	1270000	Of course, such a situation is
1270000	1272000	there are many recipients,
1272000	1274000	each group will have many recipients.
1274000	1276000	What did they find?
1276000	1278000	They found that
1278000	1280000	the first study I just talked about
1280000	1282000	was about
1282000	1284000	grateful, grateful
1284000	1286000	side, accept the benefits,
1286000	1288000	grateful to this side of the person.
1288000	1290000	But my other
1290000	1292000	study, he found that
1292000	1294000	when my partner expressed gratitude to me,
1294000	1296000	I accepted the side of gratitude.
1296000	1298000	If my partner
1298000	1300000	expressed gratitude to me,
1300000	1302000	if my partner expressed gratitude to me today,
1302000	1304000	at the same time,
1304000	1306000	today I will have more
1306000	1308000	commitment to our relationship.
1308000	1310000	So
1310000	1312000	on the other hand,
1312000	1314000	he supported this theory,
1314000	1316000	Find, Remind, My Theory,
1316000	1318000	this theory,
1318000	1320000	it is true that expressing gratitude is effective,
1320000	1322000	it can help us fix
1322000	1324000	accept gratitude,
1324000	1326000	first good to us,
1326000	1328000	and then accept our gratitude
1328000	1330000	.
1330000	1332000	Then I will talk about the last
1332000	1334000	study,
1334000	1336000	the last study, it is a complete
1336000	1338000	experiment, the question he asked
1338000	1340000	was a little different,
1340000	1342000	instead of saying that he wanted to
1342000	1344000	examine the phenomenon of this theory,
1344000	1346000	that is, on the phenomenon of gratitude,
1346000	1348000	can it help us maintain our relationship?
1348000	1350000	What he wanted to ask more was
1352000	1354000	what kind of way
1354000	1356000	to express gratitude and maintain a relationship?
1356000	1358000	He revealed the past literature,
1358000	1360000	he said, you see,
1360000	1362000	gratitude can really maintain a relationship,
1362000	1364000	but what kind of behavior,
1364000	1366000	what kind of action,
1366000	1368000	you can even say that it is an action
1368000	1370000	to maintain a relationship.
1372000	1374000	In fact, it is a bit like the cultural research I did,
1374000	1376000	but he did not ask about culture,
1376000	1378000	he did not look at the difference between cultures,
1378000	1380000	he looked at whether there was
1380000	1382000	a general action.
1382000	1384000	In this
1384000	1386000	literature on interpersonal relationships,
1386000	1388000	everyone can try it later,
1388000	1390000	there is an action in the literature on interpersonal relationships
1390000	1392000	that can
1394000	1396000	predict the maintenance of
1396000	1398000	this relationship,
1398000	1400000	for example,
1400000	1402000	when I am talking,
1402000	1404000	I touch my nose while
1404000	1406000	I grab my nose like this,
1406000	1408000	or I will be used to grabbing my head,
1408000	1410000	or I am used to sitting on the chair,
1410000	1412000	what I am doing now is rotating,
1412000	1414000	rotating,
1414000	1416000	and these are not meaningful behaviors.
1418000	1420000	Everyone will have something like this
1420000	1422000	when they talk,
1422000	1424000	if we imitate this behavior of other people,
1424000	1426000	for example, I am talking now,
1426000	1428000	then I will grab my nose,
1428000	1430000	then you also listen and it seems to be
1430000	1432000	something like that.
1432000	1434000	It seems to have nothing to do with what we are talking about.
1434000	1436000	But they find that
1436000	1438000	when we have a conversation or
1438000	1440000	one talks, one listens,
1440000	1442000	to ask the speaker,
1442000	1444000	that is me,
1444000	1446000	for example,
1446000	1448000	ask me how much I like
1448000	1450000	the person in front of me
1450000	1452000	who listens to me or talks to me.
1452000	1454000	People who are imitated
1454000	1456000	will feel that they prefer the person in front of them.
1456000	1458000	It seems that he and this person
1458000	1460000	have the same pain.
1460000	1462000	The two people are
1462000	1464000	relatively close in frequency.
1464000	1466000	Then this research can
1466000	1468000	be done in the past.
1468000	1470000	You call a
1470000	1472000	experimental group,
1472000	1474000	then the professor will come
1474000	1476000	and ask him to give him a manuscript,
1476000	1478000	casually ask him to speak a little speech.
1478000	1480000	Then in the process of asking him to speak,
1480000	1482000	call the experimental group to imitate his actions.
1482000	1484000	Imitate his actions without discrimination.
1484000	1486000	Of course, this research will ask
1486000	1488000	the speaker
1488000	1490000	to say
1490000	1492000	how strange you think the other person is,
1492000	1494000	how deliberate
1494000	1496000	you have been,
1496000	1498000	how strange you are,
1498000	1500000	and if you notice that you are being imitated,
1500000	1502000	let's delete it first.
1502000	1504000	We only leave those who do not notice
1504000	1506000	and do not feel that they are being imitated,
1506000	1508000	but are actually being imitated.
1508000	1510000	As a result,
1510000	1512000	there is another group,
1512000	1514000	the control group,
1514000	1516000	which is not deliberately imitated.
1516000	1518000	The group of people who are being imitated
1518000	1520000	will prefer the experimental group,
1520000	1522000	and in the future
1522000	1524000	they will prefer the experimental group.
1524000	1526000	In the past research,
1526000	1528000	I found this.
1528000	1530000	Therefore,
1530000	1532000	I want to talk about this research,
1532000	1534000	probably everyone knows
1534000	1536000	what I am going to do.
1536000	1538000	It is to trigger the feeling of gratitude
1538000	1540000	in the laboratory
1540000	1542000	,
1542000	1544000	and then see
1544000	1546000	if the person who has the feeling of gratitude
1546000	1548000	will run to imitate other people's behavior.
1548000	1550000	Use this kind of
1550000	1552000	secretly imitating, subconsciously
1552000	1554000	imitate other people's behavior
1554000	1556000	to promote the relationship between the two people in the future.
1556000	1558000	Let's talk about the conclusion first.
1558000	1560000	The conclusion is, of course,
1560000	1562000	suppose
1562000	1564000	my wife sent me the key
1564000	1566000	and I felt very grateful,
1566000	1568000	then I said thank you to her.
1568000	1570000	In the process,
1570000	1572000	I may even forget to say thank you,
1572000	1574000	but I will start to subconsciously imitate
1574000	1576000	some of her actions.
1576000	1578000	After she gave me the key,
1578000	1580000	she was going to leave,
1580000	1582000	and I started to feel
1582000	1584000	that Zhang Yiping was more friendly,
1584000	1586000	and I felt better.
1586000	1588000	Something like this.
1592000	1594000	But the conclusion is this.
1594000	1596000	I like this research very much.
1596000	1598000	This is a team from Singapore
1598000	1600000	in 2015 or 2016.
1600000	1602000	He did it very,
1602000	1604000	very carefully.
1604000	1606000	This is also another feature of
1606000	1608000	good emotional research.
1608000	1610000	He will do things very carefully.
1610000	1612000	First of all,
1612000	1614000	although you can produce a group of
1614000	1616000	grateful groups,
1616000	1618000	for example,
1618000	1620000	when you give them some benefits
1620000	1622000	when the recipient comes,
1622000	1624000	for example,
1624000	1626000	give him some money,
1626000	1628000	let him feel more grateful,
1628000	1630000	then you ask him,
1630000	1632000	he will feel good,
1632000	1634000	someone gave me money,
1634000	1636000	I am very happy,
1636000	1638000	it feels like one group is more grateful,
1638000	1640000	the other group is more ungrateful,
1640000	1642000	but at the same time,
1642000	1644000	the money is not only grateful,
1644000	1646000	there must be some kind of luck,
1646000	1648000	or today the sun came out from the west,
1648000	1650000	and there are some
1650000	1652000	feelings of surprise,
1652000	1654000	but these feelings are not
1654000	1656000	grateful,
1656000	1658000	but other emotions.
1658000	1660000	So this research team
1660000	1662000	at the same time
1662000	1664000	created several
1664000	1666000	different experimental scenarios
1666000	1668000	to distinguish these different emotions,
1668000	1670000	the most important of which
1670000	1672000	is to feel very lucky
1672000	1674000	and feel very grateful.
1674000	1676000	The method is like this,
1676000	1678000	he first invites the recipient
1678000	1680000	to collaborate with the experimenter,
1680000	1682000	he tells the recipient that the
1682000	1684000	experimenter is another recipient,
1684000	1686000	but he is actually a collateral,
1686000	1688000	he plays a small game with the
1688000	1690000	experimenter,
1690000	1692000	and in the process,
1692000	1694000	the experimenter and the collateral
1694000	1696000	can work together to achieve the goal,
1696000	1698000	or they can compete with each other
1698000	1700000	and see who gets more points.
1700000	1702000	Then,
1702000	1704000	in one scenario,
1704000	1706000	he makes the collateral compete with the recipient,
1706000	1708000	so the collateral becomes
1708000	1710000	a jerk,
1710000	1712000	so everyone hates him,
1712000	1714000	this is the most basic baseline.
1714000	1716000	In another scenario,
1716000	1718000	the experimenter lets the collateral
1718000	1720000	cooperate with the recipient,
1720000	1722000	so the collateral becomes a good person,
1722000	1724000	but at the same time,
1724000	1726000	he also distinguishes two situations,
1726000	1728000	he tells the recipient that
1728000	1730000	whether the collateral wants to
1730000	1732000	cooperate with him or not,
1732000	1734000	he decides,
1734000	1736000	so if he cooperates today,
1736000	1738000	he is really a good person,
1738000	1740000	he intentionally wants to be good to you,
1740000	1742000	if he doesn't cooperate,
1742000	1744000	he is a bad person.
1744000	1746000	But in another situation,
1746000	1748000	he doesn't have much control,
1748000	1750000	he just randomly instructs the recipient
1750000	1752000	whether he wants to cooperate with him or not,
1752000	1754000	so even if he cooperates with you today,
1754000	1756000	his potential regret is that
1756000	1758000	if he cooperates with you,
1758000	1760000	it's not his credit,
1760000	1762000	it's just the order he received.
1762000	1764000	So,
1764000	1766000	here they have three groups,
1766000	1768000	the first group is the baseline,
1768000	1770000	which is a jerk,
1770000	1772000	you hate your collateral,
1772000	1774000	he doesn't cooperate with you,
1774000	1776000	you hate him.
1776000	1778000	If he cooperates with you,
1778000	1780000	you will feel grateful,
1780000	1782000	but if he happens to be instructed
1782000	1784000	to do good to you,
1784000	1786000	you will only feel lucky,
1786000	1788000	you will not feel grateful.
1788000	1790000	Then they continue to do this,
1790000	1792000	they tell the recipient that
1792000	1794000	this time is over,
1794000	1796000	we will go to the second stage,
1796000	1798000	it has nothing to do with the first stage,
1798000	1800000	but you and the collateral
1800000	1802000	are going to have a dialogue discussion,
1802000	1804000	then he is going to see
1804000	1806000	if the recipient is going to imitate
1806000	1808000	the action of this collateral,
1808000	1810000	and then he found that the lucky group
1810000	1812000	actually did not imitate the phenomenon,
1812000	1814000	only the grateful group has,
1814000	1816000	it shows that it is not as long as we are happy,
1816000	1818000	any positive emotion
1818000	1820000	will produce bonding,
1820000	1822000	social bonding behavior,
1822000	1824000	there will only be grateful,
1824000	1826000	at least luck will not have.
1826000	1828000	Then,
1828000	1830000	how do we measure this
1830000	1832000	imitation?
1832000	1834000	He asked
1834000	1836000	this
1836000	1838000	collateral
1838000	1840000	to touch his hair
1840000	1842000	if he had nothing to do,
1842000	1844000	and then count
1844000	1846000	the number of times
1846000	1848000	you touched your hair
1848000	1850000	during the second stage of the dialogue.
1850000	1852000	There is a
1852000	1854000	configuration here,
1854000	1856000	there are viewers who want to provide
1856000	1858000	that the experiment you are talking about
1858000	1860000	has been verified on the operation,
1860000	1862000	is there a check of manipulation?
1862000	1864000	Yes,
1864000	1866000	they just asked,
1866000	1868000	they later asked
1868000	1870000	at the end of the experiment,
1870000	1872000	because sometimes the check of manipulation
1872000	1874000	will not be in the middle of the test,
1874000	1876000	they will say at the end
1876000	1878000	what do you feel about this person,
1878000	1880000	what kind of emotions do you have,
1880000	1882000	and then there are about 20 emotions
1882000	1884000	to ask them to evaluate,
1884000	1886000	and then it is true that the grateful group
1886000	1888000	is grateful, the lucky group is lucky,
1888000	1890000	and then the baseline group
1890000	1892000	is the baseline,
1892000	1894000	so there is,
1894000	1896000	thank you,
1896000	1898000	and then he went to
1898000	1900000	count the number of times
1900000	1902000	he touched his hair,
1902000	1904000	and then it is true that he
1904000	1906000	touched his hair more than once,
1906000	1908000	but there is a confounding,
1908000	1910000	there is another possible
1910000	1912000	explanation,
1912000	1914000	he just feels grateful,
1914000	1916000	he just can't sit still,
1916000	1918000	he likes to move around,
1918000	1920000	so he just touched his hair more than once,
1920000	1922000	this may not have anything to do with
1922000	1924000	specifically imitating the other person's behavior,
1924000	1926000	do you understand what this means?
1926000	1928000	As long as I become very active,
1928000	1930000	and then touch my heart,
1930000	1932000	I will touch my hair more than once,
1932000	1934000	but it doesn't matter if the other person
1934000	1936000	is touching his hair,
1936000	1938000	how do you know that it is because
1938000	1940000	the other person is only touching his hair,
1940000	1942000	maybe it's just right,
1942000	1944000	so they used several different actions
1944000	1946000	, one group is touching his hair,
1946000	1948000	the other group is touching his nose,
1948000	1950000	and then one is touching his ears,
1950000	1952000	so what we want to see is
1952000	1954000	if today is going
1954000	1956000	this hyperactivation,
1956000	1958000	that is, this kind of
1958000	1960000	explanation that can't sit still,
1960000	1962000	then he just has to
1962000	1964000	touch his ears, touch his nose,
1964000	1966000	touch his eyes,
1966000	1968000	all of them have to go up together,
1968000	1970000	there is no variability,
1970000	1972000	but if it is an imitation behavior,
1972000	1974000	then there is also a variability,
1974000	1976000	that is, there is also a variability,
1976000	1978000	so much talk,
1978000	1980000	I found that I talk about this research,
1980000	1982000	how to the next page,
1982000	1984000	so much talk,
1984000	1986000	in fact, the conclusion is that
1986000	1988000	I just said,
1988000	1990000	gratefulness will be produced
1990000	1992000	through behavioral imitation,
1992000	1994000	this bonding effect,
1994000	1996000	this is a possibility,
1996000	1998000	that talk so much,
1998000	2000000	in fact, just want to demo,
2000000	2002000	then put it in a variety of ways
2002000	2004000	to control time,
2004000	2006000	finally to talk about
2006000	2008000	our own research,
2008000	2010000	we can pause
2010000	2012000	it,
2012000	2014000	because now just to a section,
2014000	2016000	then there are
2016000	2018000	viewers want to ask questions,
2018000	2020000	I directly open the microphone to ask him,
2020000	2022000	please,
2022000	2024000	you say,
2024000	2026000	he may just become very active,
2026000	2028000	I keep moving,
2028000	2030000	but you can not put him
2030000	2032000	the number of times,
2032000	2034000	normalize by the total movement,
2034000	2036000	that is to say,
2036000	2038000	he changed his hair
2038000	2040000	in all of his actions,
2040000	2042000	the proportion of the amount,
2042000	2044000	that does not matter,
2044000	2046000	he becomes very active,
2046000	2048000	this thing,
2048000	2050000	then you can not put him
2050000	2052000	the number of times,
2052000	2054000	then he becomes very active,
2054000	2056000	this thing,
2056000	2058000	this is actually a good practice,
2058000	2060000	it is also a practice that we often do,
2060000	2062000	but indeed this research,
2062000	2064000	not this research,
2064000	2066000	is the same team
2066000	2068000	of the last publication,
2068000	2070000	he did this way,
2070000	2072000	but the next one,
2072000	2074000	they tried to use the experimental way
2074000	2076000	to do the effect directly,
2076000	2078000	not just to control it in a statistical way,
2078000	2080000	that is,
2080000	2082000	in theory it is feasible,
2082000	2084000	but if you can do it,
2084000	2086000	that is, I am very powerful,
2086000	2088000	I can do it,
2088000	2090000	so more of that,
2090000	2092000	when you see his experimental design,
2092000	2094000	wow, this is so smart,
2094000	2096000	but you are right,
2096000	2098000	indeed a lot of people do this.
2098000	2100000	Hi,
2100000	2102000	my name is Steffie,
2102000	2104000	I am a PhD student at Nanjia University,
2104000	2106000	but I do not have a background in psychology,
2106000	2108000	but what I want to ask is,
2108000	2110000	you said gratitude,
2110000	2112000	this emotion,
2112000	2114000	this emotion,
2114000	2116000	and gratitude expression,
2116000	2118000	I think they may have a little different definition,
2118000	2120000	do these two have,
2120000	2122000	that is, there is research
2122000	2124000	that shows that they have a proportional relationship,
2124000	2126000	or is it possible that someone has this emotion,
2126000	2128000	but actually does not express it,
2128000	2130000	then it may be more like the definition part,
2130000	2132000	because I have read some
2132000	2134000	articles related to emotion,
2134000	2136000	and their definitions may be
2136000	2138000	different,
2138000	2140000	some people are more focused on
2140000	2142000	physical reactions,
2142000	2144000	or in the mind,
2144000	2146000	psychological feelings,
2146000	2148000	I do not know what you think of this,
2148000	2150000	and what you think the definition is.
2150000	2152000	OK,
2152000	2154000	let's talk about the simple one first,
2154000	2156000	or let's say the most difficult one,
2156000	2158000	this is the most difficult one,
2158000	2160000	because this is the most difficult one,
2160000	2162000	because this is the most difficult one,
2162000	2164000	or let's say the most difficult one,
2164000	2166000	the most difficult one is how to define the emotion,
2166000	2168000	then how do I define it,
2168000	2170000	I think only the subjective feeling,
2170000	2172000	I personally, I personally,
2172000	2174000	I believe that many people do not say this,
2174000	2176000	I personally feel that the emotion is the subjective feeling,
2176000	2178000	I feel very grateful today,
2178000	2180000	that thing is called grateful emotion,
2180000	2182000	I feel very angry today,
2182000	2184000	then
2184000	2186000	that subjective feeling,
2186000	2188000	I call it emotion,
2188000	2190000	the rest,
2190000	2192000	you can say, for example,
2192000	2194000	how do I express my anger,
2194000	2196000	that is called grateful expression,
2196000	2198000	how do I understand
2198000	2200000	the context of my anger,
2200000	2202000	or the context of gratitude,
2202000	2204000	that is my perception,
2204000	2206000	part of the emotional perception,
2206000	2208000	but I will not put all these things
2208000	2210000	are called grateful,
2210000	2212000	are called grateful,
2212000	2214000	are called grateful emotion,
2214000	2216000	because in fact there is no meaning,
2216000	2218000	and this is not the same as the general common people
2218000	2220000	is that there is a gap,
2220000	2222000	you have to define that word,
2222000	2224000	I do not care,
2224000	2226000	but this definition is very strange,
2226000	2228000	so I would say
2228000	2230000	only the emotional part is,
2230000	2232000	so this also,
2232000	2234000	in a way, I guess I also answer your
2234000	2236000	other question,
2236000	2238000	is grateful emotion and grateful expression,
2238000	2240000	why is it different,
2240000	2242000	grateful expression is focused on discussing
2242000	2244000	his physical actions,
2244000	2246000	but the emotional part is my subjective feeling,
2246000	2248000	okay,
2248000	2250000	that two things are not related to it,
2250000	2252000	I can,
2252000	2254000	the data shows that
2254000	2256000	my subjective report,
2256000	2258000	how grateful I feel,
2258000	2260000	this subjective report
2260000	2262000	with my grateful expression of behavior
2262000	2264000	is really related,
2264000	2266000	this is probably not very surprising,
2266000	2268000	and is highly relevant,
2268000	2270000	this is certainly not surprising,
2270000	2272000	but I think everyone may not be very surprised,
2272000	2274000	that is, this is definitely not related to
2274000	2276000	someone is fake,
2276000	2278000	in fact, you do not feel,
2278000	2280000	but you must
2280000	2282000	elders
2282000	2284000	give us some
2284000	2286000	gifts that we do not like,
2286000	2288000	we have to say thank you to the scalp,
2288000	2290000	this kind of thing we also have experience,
2290000	2292000	this kind of thing also exists,
2292000	2294000	it also explains why it is not related,
2294000	2296000	on the contrary, there are many times
2296000	2298000	grateful expression of the situation,
2298000	2300000	such as strangers do something to you,
2300000	2302000	then you feel very grateful,
2302000	2304000	for example, you do not even meet strangers,
2304000	2306000	for example,
2306000	2308000	he silently put this
2308000	2310000	community hall
2310000	2312000	very clean,
2312000	2314000	but you do not meet this person,
2314000	2316000	then how to express to whom,
2316000	2318000	so this situation is also there,
2318000	2320000	so there is no emotional expression,
2320000	2322000	so to answer your other question,
2322000	2324000	these two things will not be highly related,
2324000	2326000	whether it is related,
2326000	2328000	whether it can be divided,
2328000	2330000	so it is like this,
2330000	2332000	did I miss any questions?
2332000	2334000	No,
2334000	2336000	I do not think so,
2336000	2338000	I just want to say,
2338000	2340000	I know they define different,
2340000	2342000	I also understand those points,
2342000	2344000	I do not know if there is a overlapping part,
2346000	2348000	what is the overlapping part,
2350000	2352000	you are now a bit of it,
2352000	2354000	emotion is a subjective feeling,
2354000	2356000	so that person himself
2356000	2358000	knows if he has this emotion,
2358000	2360000	then the expression
2360000	2362000	may be external,
2362000	2364000	you can observe
2364000	2366000	behavior,
2366000	2368000	so the two are completely
2368000	2370000	completely separate two things,
2370000	2372000	in your mind,
2372000	2374000	I prefer to be like this,
2374000	2376000	I just look at it now,
2376000	2378000	that is to say, Mark said that emotion
2378000	2380000	is a system,
2382000	2384000	I know a lot of people have this
2384000	2386000	angle, but I do not
2386000	2388000	say that emotion is a system,
2388000	2390000	I would say that there is a system of
2390000	2392000	emotion around
2392000	2394000	gratitude,
2394000	2396000	I want to say that gratitude is a good emotion,
2396000	2398000	there is an expression next to it, there is an observation next to it,
2398000	2400000	there are cognitive components next to it,
2400000	2402000	there are context components,
2402000	2404000	there are even cultural components,
2404000	2406000	it has a system,
2406000	2408000	this is what I can agree with,
2408000	2410000	but emotion is a system,
2410000	2412000	I want to say this,
2412000	2414000	many people say this,
2414000	2416000	you walk on the road,
2416000	2418000	see how people use the word emotion,
2418000	2420000	no one uses it like this,
2420000	2422000	if you don't use it like this,
2422000	2424000	you have to define it like this,
2424000	2426000	I think it's a bit deliberate,
2426000	2428000	and
2430000	2432000	it's not necessarily helpful,
2432000	2434000	I think,
2434000	2436000	this is my own comment,
2436000	2438000	but I'm sure a lot of people
2438000	2440000	outside will say that emotion is a
2440000	2442000	system,
2442000	2444000	I think it's a bit different.
2444000	2446000	Yes, I probably understand that angle,
2446000	2448000	I have seen some related
2448000	2450000	articles before,
2450000	2452000	some people will argue that
2452000	2454000	sometimes emotions
2454000	2456000	appear subconsciously,
2456000	2458000	and sometimes they follow subjective feelings,
2458000	2460000	I have seen this kind of statement,
2460000	2462000	so I want to ask
2462000	2464000	what the people in the background really think, thank you.
2464000	2466000	But I can't
2466000	2468000	represent everyone
2468000	2470000	to talk about this matter,
2470000	2472000	but I personally
2472000	2474000	always feel that the field of
2474000	2476000	emotional research is independent
2476000	2478000	or has relative independence,
2478000	2480000	because it has feelings,
2480000	2482000	and it has very strong subjective feelings,
2482000	2484000	this is why we call it emotional,
2484000	2486000	if you say there is an emotion,
2486000	2488000	he can't feel it,
2488000	2490000	then we say that it is a different
2490000	2492000	psychological state,
2492000	2494000	no normal person would call it emotion,
2494000	2496000	it's weird,
2496000	2498000	I don't know what I mean,
2498000	2500000	so next I want to tell you
2500000	2502000	this research,
2502000	2504000	this is a more
2504000	2506000	exploratory research,
2506000	2508000	we want to
2508000	2510000	ask a question,
2510000	2512000	thank you,
2512000	2514000	indeed,
2514000	2516000	my partner and I,
2516000	2518000	both can promote interpersonal relations,
2518000	2520000	past research has also found,
2520000	2522000	past research has also found some
2522000	2524000	physical mechanism,
2524000	2526000	or
2526000	2528000	behavioral mechanism,
2528000	2530000	but these components
2530000	2532000	between
2532000	2534000	independence
2534000	2536000	how about it,
2536000	2538000	how much overlap between them,
2538000	2540000	so we have to ask this question,
2540000	2542000	in this research,
2542000	2544000	we found more than 200 couples,
2544000	2546000	I think it's
2546000	2548000	400 to 500 people,
2548000	2550000	we both
2550000	2552000	came early,
2552000	2554000	then ask them to
2554000	2556000	record every day,
2556000	2558000	did the other person
2558000	2560000	say thank you to me today,
2560000	2562000	pay attention to this behavior,
2562000	2564000	did you say thank you to me,
2564000	2566000	did I receive the other person's
2566000	2568000	gratitude, both
2568000	2570000	people hit, so you can see
2570000	2572000	received by me
2572000	2574000	and received by my partner,
2574000	2576000	then there is express,
2576000	2578000	it seems to be gone,
2578000	2580000	it's gone,
2580000	2582000	but I can't see the video,
2582000	2584000	wait a minute,
2596000	2598000	OK,
2598000	2600000	this is a slide,
2600000	2602000	so
2602000	2604000	in the 14-day process,
2604000	2606000	we ask both people
2606000	2608000	to record every day,
2608000	2610000	did you express your gratitude to me,
2610000	2612000	did you say thank you to me,
2612000	2614000	at the same time,
2614000	2616000	did you say thank you to your partner,
2616000	2618000	you can imagine,
2618000	2620000	I thank my partner,
2620000	2622000	I say thank you to my partner,
2622000	2624000	it's a pair,
2624000	2626000	it's just the same event,
2626000	2628000	then from two different angles,
2628000	2630000	two different people's
2630000	2632000	perspective,
2632000	2634000	so these four measurements
2634000	2636000	can be paired like this,
2636000	2638000	from me to my partner,
2638000	2640000	and vice versa,
2640000	2642000	my partner can also flow back like this,
2642000	2644000	so it's two pairs,
2644000	2646000	then we take these four
2646000	2648000	events
2648000	2650000	to predict every day,
2650000	2652000	we also ask the receiver
2652000	2654000	to answer every day,
2654000	2656000	how satisfied are you with
2656000	2658000	your relationship with you today,
2658000	2660000	and then there is,
2660000	2662000	yes, that's it,
2662000	2664000	and then we can calculate
2664000	2666000	ups and downs,
2666000	2668000	like the design of the experiment,
2668000	2670000	then we use these four events
2670000	2672000	at the same time to predict
2672000	2674000	every day,
2674000	2676000	ups and downs,
2676000	2678000	the result can be seen,
2678000	2680000	that is,
2680000	2682000	the same one,
2682000	2684000	let's say it's a gratitude episode,
2684000	2686000	I thank you,
2686000	2688000	then you are thanked,
2688000	2690000	the same episode,
2690000	2692000	you say I thank you,
2692000	2694000	I say I thank you,
2694000	2696000	from the perspective of two different people,
2700000	2702000	then we found that
2702000	2704000	this is what I say,
2704000	2706000	now the green one is what I say,
2706000	2708000	you thank me,
2708000	2710000	then I say I thank you,
2710000	2712000	then this is what you say,
2712000	2714000	I thank you,
2714000	2716000	then this is what you say,
2716000	2718000	you thank me,
2718000	2720000	we found that these four
2720000	2722000	are enough for my
2722000	2724000	prediction effect,
2724000	2726000	and it is an independent
2726000	2728000	prediction effect,
2728000	2730000	what does this mean?
2730000	2732000	Yes, I will feel better,
2732000	2734000	my relationship will be better,
2734000	2736000	what does this mean?
2736000	2738000	Let's talk about these two green ones first,
2738000	2740000	these two are more intuitive,
2740000	2742000	these two are
2742000	2744000	if you thank me, I will feel happier,
2744000	2746000	this is a bit of nonsense,
2746000	2748000	you thank me, I feel happier,
2748000	2750000	this is very intuitive,
2750000	2752000	if you thank me, I will feel happier,
2752000	2754000	this is very intuitive,
2756000	2758000	because there should be something good happened,
2758000	2760000	I have to thank you,
2760000	2762000	so I should be happier today,
2762000	2764000	but we found that
2764000	2766000	this green one
2766000	2768000	means
2768000	2770000	you thank me,
2770000	2772000	you say you thank me,
2772000	2774000	I will be happier,
2774000	2776000	and this thing is independent of
2776000	2778000	whether I say you thank me,
2778000	2780000	although I say no,
2780000	2782000	I did not notice,
2782000	2784000	do you thank me?
2784000	2786000	Although my reaction today is like this,
2786000	2788000	this invisible thank you
2788000	2790000	will still reflect
2790000	2792000	my satisfaction with my relationship today,
2796000	2798000	do you understand?
2798000	2800000	This is invisible,
2800000	2802000	because this thing is independent,
2802000	2804000	our research has made it independent,
2804000	2806000	I say you thank me,
2806000	2808000	although I say no,
2808000	2810000	the part you say will still reflect
2810000	2812000	my satisfaction with my relationship,
2812000	2814000	the more strange thing is that
2816000	2818000	the audience asked
2818000	2820000	how to record
2820000	2822000	or measure
2822000	2824000	the so-called thanks
2824000	2826000	, how to do
2826000	2828000	the more objective part
2828000	2830000	?
2830000	2832000	We use binary measurement,
2832000	2834000	so yes or no,
2834000	2836000	do you thank others?
2836000	2838000	Yes or no,
2838000	2840000	we let both of them answer,
2840000	2842000	so we can stack their data
2842000	2844000	from left to right,
2844000	2846000	it is a binary measurement,
2848000	2850000	this is more strange,
2850000	2852000	you say I thank you,
2852000	2854000	although I say no,
2854000	2856000	I do not remember,
2856000	2858000	this is strange,
2858000	2860000	because it is independent of my expression,
2860000	2862000	at the same time I will feel happier,
2862000	2864000	although you say I thank you,
2864000	2866000	but I say I do not remember,
2866000	2868000	I will feel happier,
2870000	2872000	we have an explanation for this thing,
2874000	2876000	because everyone can see
2876000	2878000	this relationship,
2878000	2880000	we draw it like this,
2880000	2882000	let it become a loop,
2882000	2884000	you think I thank you,
2884000	2886000	then you will express to me,
2886000	2888000	then you will do something
2888000	2890000	to make you a better partner,
2890000	2892000	so it will become,
2892000	2894000	I will get a better partner,
2894000	2896000	I will feel happier,
2896000	2898000	this is a long shot,
2898000	2900000	this is an explanation,
2900000	2902000	we have not tested yet,
2902000	2904000	but this is a possible explanation.
2906000	2908000	At the same time,
2908000	2910000	I finished this chapter to ask you a question,
2910000	2912000	at the same time,
2912000	2914000	we also measured
2914000	2916000	the relationship between
2916000	2918000	these beneficiaries
2918000	2920000	,
2920000	2922000	the degree of satisfaction
2922000	2924000	for their own lives,
2924000	2926000	not for this relationship,
2926000	2928000	but for the overall life,
2928000	2930000	there is the same effect,
2930000	2932000	and this effect is completely
2932000	2934000	terminated by relationship satisfaction,
2934000	2936000	here I want to stop
2936000	2938000	and ask you a question,
2938000	2940000	we have a question
2940000	2942000	here,
2942000	2944000	he wants to ask about the binary part,
2944000	2946000	then ask Felix directly,
2948000	2950000	is Felix there?
2960000	2962000	Hello,
2962000	2964000	I am Felix,
2964000	2966000	the question I want to ask
2966000	2968000	is related to the binary part,
2968000	2970000	because now the senior
2970000	2972000	is asking
2972000	2974000	if they feel it,
2974000	2976000	my question is
2976000	2978000	how many times a day
2978000	2980000	do you throw it out
2980000	2982000	and ask him
2982000	2984000	if he feels it?
2984000	2986000	Or ask him after the day
2986000	2988000	to recall how many times he received
2988000	2990000	and how many times he thanked?
2990000	2992000	This is a good question,
2992000	2994000	we only ask once a day,
2994000	2996000	before going to bed,
2996000	2998000	did this happen all day?
2998000	3000000	Okay, thank you.
3006000	3008000	Hello,
3008000	3010000	I have another question,
3010000	3012000	where is this done?
3012000	3014000	What is the background of the object?
3014000	3016000	These people
3016000	3018000	are in
3018000	3020000	Beka
3020000	3022000	Triangle
3022000	3024000	,
3024000	3026000	so the object
3026000	3028000	is the person living there,
3028000	3030000	who is it?
3030000	3032000	Anyone over the age of 18,
3032000	3034000	basically anyone over the age of 18,
3034000	3036000	if I remember correctly,
3036000	3038000	the youngest couple,
3038000	3040000	the youngest victim
3040000	3042000	is 18 years old,
3042000	3044000	our low standard,
3044000	3046000	we ask them to be 18 years old,
3046000	3048000	the oldest is
3048000	3050000	67 years old,
3050000	3052000	if I remember correctly.
3058000	3060000	OK, thank you.
3060000	3062000	I think this should be
3062000	3064000	supplemented,
3064000	3066000	you can imagine,
3066000	3068000	if our age range is so large,
3068000	3070000	their relationship should be very large,
3070000	3072000	just started dating for a month,
3072000	3074000	married for 20-30 years,
3074000	3076000	so this range is
3076000	3078000	a nice range.
3084000	3086000	Is there any question from the audience?
3092000	3094000	If not,
3094000	3096000	I have a question myself,
3096000	3098000	I would like to ask the senior
3098000	3100000	in this study,
3100000	3102000	do you have any control,
3102000	3104000	which is the main
3104000	3106000	confounding?
3106000	3108000	Yes,
3108000	3110000	this is also a very good question,
3110000	3112000	we ask him every night,
3112000	3114000	do you thank people,
3114000	3116000	have you been thanked,
3116000	3118000	we actually asked a bunch of
3118000	3120000	different things,
3120000	3122000	some of them are more important,
3122000	3124000	in the past, it was also found that
3124000	3126000	the satisfaction of the relationship
3126000	3128000	is a very important prediction,
3128000	3130000	including whether the other party
3130000	3132000	has done half of the plus,
3132000	3134000	we are not asking this,
3134000	3136000	we are asking if there is
3136000	3138000	a fair amount of plus or something,
3138000	3140000	anyway, it is a similar wording,
3140000	3142000	fairness, reciprocity,
3142000	3144000	this is very important,
3144000	3146000	this is basically
3146000	3148000	the most important component of
3148000	3150000	subjectivity is difficult to say,
3150000	3152000	but subjectivity and reciprocity are very important,
3152000	3154000	we have control of this,
3154000	3156000	the result is the same,
3156000	3158000	we also have control of
3158000	3160000	whether the other party is very polite,
3160000	3162000	how do we say
3162000	3164000	courteous,
3164000	3166000	we have control of this,
3166000	3168000	so gratitude is not
3168000	3170000	purely fair,
3170000	3172000	gratitude is not purely
3172000	3174000	polite,
3174000	3176000	we also control self-disclosure,
3176000	3178000	did the other party tell you something,
3178000	3180000	did you tell him something,
3180000	3182000	so it's not like this,
3182000	3184000	because it's not necessarily a matter of gratitude,
3184000	3186000	sometimes it's just a boss,
3186000	3188000	but in the past,
3188000	3190000	it was found that it was quite effective
3190000	3192000	to do it together,
3192000	3194000	so we have to control this,
3194000	3196000	and then we also control
3196000	3198000	whether the other party
3198000	3200000	performed very positively today,
3200000	3202000	in general,
3202000	3204000	are you a happy person,
3204000	3206000	control is purely positive,
3206000	3208000	it seems that any positive
3208000	3210000	mood is possible,
3210000	3212000	we control it,
3212000	3214000	so it doesn't matter,
3214000	3216000	so gratitude is not just happy.
3220000	3222000	Thank you, the audience here has a question,
3222000	3224000	Felix, please ask,
3224000	3226000	hello, I'm Felix,
3226000	3228000	I just asked a question,
3228000	3230000	then I want to ask one more question
3230000	3232000	for the one just now,
3232000	3234000	the mayor is now the last day,
3234000	3236000	the last day to ask him if he is grateful
3236000	3238000	or grateful,
3238000	3240000	so I want to ask,
3240000	3242000	so there is no measurement of the number of gratefulness?
3242000	3244000	No,
3244000	3246000	OK,
3246000	3248000	thank you,
3248000	3250000	this is a very good question,
3250000	3252000	because in experience sampling,
3252000	3254000	because our approach is
3254000	3256000	more like experience sampling,
3256000	3258000	that is to say,
3258000	3260000	continuously and then constantly
3260000	3262000	for the audience who do not know this method,
3262000	3264000	I think Felix may know,
3264000	3266000	for the audience who do not know this,
3266000	3268000	experience sampling
3268000	3270000	at what time to measure,
3270000	3272000	then how densely measured the frequency,
3272000	3274000	this is very important,
3274000	3276000	because you will catch
3276000	3278000	different research questions,
3278000	3280000	this thing,
3280000	3282000	I wait a minute,
3282000	3284000	I can think about it now,
3284000	3286000	I didn't talk about it now,
3286000	3288000	I'll talk about it later,
3288000	3290000	for me, everyone will know
3290000	3292000	how to catch different research questions,
3292000	3294000	especially different
3294000	3296000	temporal scope research questions,
3296000	3298000	do we still have time?
3300000	3302000	That is now
3302000	3304000	about to go,
3304000	3306000	it's almost 9.30,
3306000	3308000	see if there is any time
3308000	3310000	on the senior side
3310000	3312000	to arrange or think about it.
3312000	3314000	OK, I will finish this time in 5 minutes,
3314000	3316000	then we will finish, OK?
3316000	3318000	OK.
3318000	3320000	The next research
3320000	3322000	is very similar
3322000	3324000	to the previous research conclusion,
3324000	3326000	we just want to make the effect of gratitude
3326000	3328000	into an experiment,
3328000	3330000	not just observation,
3330000	3332000	in addition, we use
3332000	3334000	not only subjective
3334000	3336000	subjective assessment of
3336000	3338000	relationship satisfaction,
3338000	3340000	we use a more objective assessment,
3340000	3342000	that is, how much time
3342000	3344000	do you spend with your partner
3344000	3346000	? Why do we choose this
3346000	3348000	objective assessment?
3348000	3350000	For this
3350000	3352000	animal research,
3352000	3354000	more experienced friends
3354000	3356000	should know,
3356000	3358000	we are studying this
3358000	3360000	mouse, when the mousetrap
3360000	3362000	this
3362000	3364000	two mice together,
3364000	3366000	stay together for how long?
3366000	3368000	That is, we measure whether they have bonding,
3368000	3370000	so
3370000	3372000	the strength of their bonding strength,
3372000	3374000	human bonding strength,
3374000	3376000	to a certain extent,
3376000	3378000	can be measured in this way,
3378000	3380000	and this can help us pull our research to
3380000	3382000	animal research,
3382000	3384000	then this is a second
3384000	3386000	is that we use the experiment
3386000	3388000	so this experiment
3388000	3390000	is the way to measure
3390000	3392000	the first two weeks,
3392000	3394000	the first 14 days,
3394000	3396000	we asked them to go home
3396000	3398000	and do the same as just
3398000	3400000	this report,
3400000	3402000	this report is how much time
3402000	3404000	you spend with your partner,
3404000	3406000	how much time you spend today,
3406000	3408000	no matter what you do,
3408000	3410000	anyway,
3410000	3412000	and then go to the lab
3412000	3414000	to do the experiment,
3414000	3416000	there are two groups,
3416000	3418000	one group is that we
3418000	3420000	remind him to go home
3420000	3422000	and remember to thank him,
3422000	3424000	remember to say thank you,
3424000	3426000	another group is that we
3426000	3428000	give him a little nudge
3428000	3430000	I'll talk about later,
3430000	3432000	but then put them home,
3432000	3434000	then they record four weeks,
3434000	3436000	28 days,
3436000	3438000	every day you spend with your partner
3438000	3440000	how much time together,
3440000	3442000	then we want to see
3442000	3444000	these two groups
3444000	3446000	after receiving the experiment
3446000	3448000	from the front to the back,
3448000	3450000	there is a group that has increased,
3450000	3452000	a group that has not increased,
3452000	3454000	or increased not so much,
3454000	3456000	how do we do it?
3456000	3458000	We told him that this gratitude is great,
3458000	3460000	go back and remember to say thank you,
3460000	3462000	this is the first control group,
3462000	3464000	the experiment group is grateful,
3464000	3466000	then you have to remember to say thank you,
3466000	3468000	in order for you to achieve this goal,
3468000	3470000	we ask you to help you do a
3470000	3472000	gratitude plan,
3472000	3474000	but this plan is to fill in the
3474000	3476000	following blank,
3476000	3478000	when if anything happens,
3478000	3480000	then you write
3480000	3482000	how you want to express gratitude,
3482000	3484000	I'll give you an example,
3484000	3486000	for example,
3486000	3488000	when he helped me buy breakfast in the morning,
3488000	3490000	then I want to give him a
3490000	3492000	kiss to express my gratitude,
3492000	3494000	I wrote it like this,
3494000	3496000	this plan is done,
3496000	3498000	then we look at this
3498000	3500000	one-line plan,
3500000	3502000	four weeks after going home,
3502000	3504000	is there a four-week effect?
3504000	3506000	It sounds quite incredible,
3506000	3508000	for some people,
3508000	3510000	it may sound a bit incredible,
3510000	3512000	it's like writing a fill-in-the-blank,
3512000	3514000	and you have to influence how long
3514000	3516000	they spend together a day,
3516000	3518000	they don't spend time together,
3518000	3520000	just follow the plan,
3520000	3522000	how much can it affect,
3522000	3524000	I'll give you an example,
3524000	3526000	this method of manipulation
3526000	3528000	is called Implementation Intention,
3528000	3530000	in the document,
3530000	3532000	it is found to be a very simple
3532000	3534000	but very surprising effective
3534000	3536000	way to change behavior,
3536000	3538000	for example,
3538000	3540000	in this study,
3540000	3542000	we divided the subject into two groups,
3542000	3544000	one group gave them
3544000	3546000	a reminder,
3546000	3548000	it is very important to check the
3548000	3550000	uterus,
3550000	3552000	their subject is a 55-year-old
3552000	3554000	or a few years older woman,
3554000	3556000	British,
3556000	3558000	remind them that the uterus is very important,
3558000	3560000	then you have to participate in the
3560000	3562000	test,
3562000	3564000	if you want to make an appointment,
3564000	3566000	there is a phone number below,
3566000	3568000	remind him,
3568000	3570000	then you have to make a plan,
3570000	3572000	for example,
3572000	3574000	someone will write,
3574000	3576000	if it is lunch time,
3576000	3578000	then I have to call my doctor,
3578000	3580000	then make an appointment,
3580000	3582000	please help them
3582000	3584000	have an appointment
3584000	3586000	plan,
3586000	3588000	we are exactly the same,
3588000	3590000	the result found
3590000	3592000	reminder group,
3592000	3594000	then participate in
3594000	3596000	the appointment,
3596000	3598000	then participate in the appointment,
3598000	3600000	did not miss their
3600000	3602000	appointment ratio,
3602000	3604000	about 70%, 69%
3604000	3606000	on the left,
3606000	3608000	but only this one-line plan,
3608000	3610000	you can add the
3610000	3612000	attendance rate
3612000	3614000	to almost 100,
3614000	3616000	in fact, 92,
3616000	3618000	but this one-line plan
3618000	3620000	is very effective,
3620000	3622000	you can try in life,
3622000	3624000	I have tried very effective,
3624000	3626000	it does not matter to us now,
3626000	3628000	the point is that it is effective,
3628000	3630000	it is also effective in our experiment,
3630000	3632000	one-line plan effectively
3632000	3634000	improved the group of
3634000	3636000	participants in the
3636000	3638000	experiment after the
3638000	3640000	ratio of gratitude,
3640000	3642000	but this is a manipulation check,
3642000	3644000	because we want to know
3644000	3646000	whether the time together
3646000	3648000	has not changed,
3648000	3650000	of course, you can imagine
3650000	3652000	that there is,
3652000	3654000	of course, it is from the front to the back,
3654000	3656000	the experiment group increased
3656000	3658000	every day,
3658000	3660000	the average amount of time
3660000	3662000	together every day,
3662000	3664000	then the unit is a minute,
3664000	3666000	so it is nearly 80 minutes,
3666000	3668000	an hour and 20 minutes,
3668000	3670000	then the gray is the error bar,
3670000	3672000	then the red is the
3672000	3674000	control group,
3674000	3676000	then the control group is basically
3676000	3678000	the front to the back,
3678000	3680000	there is no change,
3680000	3682000	there is no change in their time together,
3682000	3684000	this is not surprising,
3684000	3686000	but one-line plan
3686000	3688000	can increase
3688000	3690000	the average time of
3690000	3692000	physical presence
3692000	3694000	every day for 80 minutes,
3694000	3696000	then you can see
3696000	3698000	below,
3698000	3700000	of course,
3700000	3702000	we have to break down
3702000	3704000	and see what you are doing
3704000	3706000	together,
3706000	3708000	then across the board,
3708000	3710000	for example,
3710000	3712000	they sleep together,
3712000	3714000	then together,
3714000	3716000	then share the project,
3716000	3718000	they are together and do
3718000	3720000	the same thing,
3720000	3722000	they are cooperating on some things,
3722000	3724000	separate project,
3724000	3726000	they are in the same room,
3726000	3728000	with each other's physical presence,
3728000	3730000	but
3730000	3732000	they are doing their own thing,
3732000	3734000	for example, you two
3734000	3736000	work from home together,
3736000	3738000	they are in the same room,
3738000	3740000	across the board,
3740000	3742000	the gratitude group has a noticeable effect.
3742000	3744000	Finally,
3744000	3746000	we have measured
3746000	3748000	a remote communication,
3748000	3750000	that is, how much time
3750000	3752000	do you spend with your partner?
3752000	3754000	Remote communication,
3754000	3756000	what does it mean?
3756000	3758000	This is to compare
3758000	3760000	that they may spend more time together,
3760000	3762000	but there is no physical presence,
3762000	3764000	they spend time together,
3764000	3766000	but there is no physical presence.
3766000	3768000	Indeed,
3768000	3770000	in this aspect,
3770000	3772000	the gratitude group
3772000	3774000	not only does not increase,
3774000	3776000	but also significantly decreases.
3776000	3778000	In other words,
3778000	3780000	gratitude has a kind of
3780000	3782000	desire for our audience,
3782000	3784000	again, this is a triangle,
3784000	3786000	this is an American,
3786000	3788000	they will have a physical
3788000	3790000	contact.
3790000	3792000	Let's go back to the mouse.
3792000	3794000	This is very important.
3794000	3796000	For this
3796000	3798000	biological research,
3798000	3800000	it is more experienced,
3800000	3802000	you may know,
3802000	3804000	physical contact,
3804000	3806000	for example, we touch
3806000	3808000	our partner,
3808000	3810000	or our partner touches
3810000	3812000	our body,
3812000	3814000	it will produce a series of
3814000	3816000	physiological chemical
3816000	3818000	cascade.
3818000	3820000	One of them
3820000	3822000	is a neurotransmitter
3822000	3824000	called oxytocin.
3824000	3826000	What is it?
3826000	3828000	Oxytocin,
3828000	3830000	in Chinese,
3830000	3832000	oxytocin.
3832000	3834000	This oxytocin
3834000	3836000	is found in the mouse,
3836000	3838000	it is actually difficult to predict
3838000	3840000	bonding.
3840000	3842000	Let's look at this mouse.
3842000	3844000	These two mice are
3844000	3846000	pre-reborn,
3846000	3848000	their characteristics are that
3848000	3850000	after mating,
3850000	3852000	they will stay together
3852000	3854000	and form an exclusive
3854000	3856000	monogamous bond.
3858000	3860000	They are not
3860000	3862000	so similar to humans,
3862000	3864000	humans are not so monogamous,
3864000	3866000	but you know what I'm talking about.
3866000	3868000	But the relatives of primary
3868000	3870000	volts, middle volts,
3870000	3872000	are not like this,
3872000	3874000	they do not have
3874000	3876000	exclusive bonds,
3876000	3878000	they are
3878000	3880000	mating, then you can change partners,
3880000	3882000	mating, then you can change partners,
3882000	3884000	but their genes are very similar,
3884000	3886000	but at least
3886000	3888000	the social bonding
3888000	3890000	is very different.
3890000	3892000	Then the study found that
3892000	3894000	oxytocin plays a very important
3894000	3896000	role in this.
3896000	3898000	Indeed,
3898000	3900000	by manipulating the primary volts
3900000	3902000	and the middle volts
3902000	3904000	oxytocin receptor,
3904000	3906000	we can make these mice
3906000	3908000	operate from
3908000	3910000	exclusive bonds
3910000	3912000	into open relationships.
3912000	3914000	We can also make open relationships
3914000	3916000	into exclusive.
3916000	3918000	Indeed,
3918000	3920000	because of this reason,
3920000	3922000	we collected the urine of
3922000	3924000	these mammals
3924000	3926000	to measure
3926000	3928000	their oxytocin
3928000	3930000	amount.
3930000	3932000	We have this marker inside.
3932000	3934000	Now back to the previous point,
3934000	3936000	why
3936000	3938000	the daily report method,
3938000	3940000	if you are in one day,
3940000	3942000	randomly find a time to BIP your
3942000	3944000	victim, or you are
3944000	3946000	the last time to sleep
3946000	3948000	to a summary,
3948000	3950000	there is a difference,
3950000	3952000	because we can imagine
3952000	3954000	if we do today is
3954000	3956000	a general biological experiment,
3956000	3958000	many times we will say,
3958000	3960000	no, the most accurate draw at the scene,
3960000	3962000	so you have to know how high
3962000	3964000	now you have to draw now,
3964000	3966000	so if you draw out, you will be very
3966000	3968000	accurate to know
3968000	3970000	the degree of oxytocin now,
3970000	3972000	then you can ask
3972000	3974000	the degree of oxytocin now affects
3974000	3976000	the human behavior
3976000	3978000	in this moment.
3978000	3980000	But we all know,
3980000	3982000	I feel oxytocin now,
3982000	3984000	then I have bonding,
3984000	3986000	I may not have the opportunity to express gratitude,
3986000	3988000	I may have to spend
3988000	3990000	you do not know if I am now
3990000	3992000	you thank me, my oxytocin is about to rush up,
3992000	3994000	or two hours later
3994000	3996000	rush up to make me
3996000	3998000	express my gratitude to you at night?
3998000	4000000	I do not know, because the time was pulled
4000000	4002000	very long,
4002000	4004000	so once you study the problem,
4004000	4006000	this temporal scope becomes larger,
4006000	4008000	you may need to measure the way a little change,
4008000	4010000	such as we use urine, because you do not
4010000	4012000	urine inside the oxytocin marker
4012000	4014000	is basically
4014000	4016000	considered to be a certain extent
4016000	4018000	or a long period of time
4018000	4020000	oxytocin level average,
4020000	4022000	because the urine
4022000	4024000	to hold for a while in the temporal scope,
4024000	4026000	so you high, high, low,
4026000	4028000	then after the average, the amount of marker will stay in your
4028000	4030000	urine, so it is a relatively long-term average,
4030000	4032000	with us in front of the
4032000	4034000	daily report is similar,
4034000	4036000	so when we ask the question now,
4036000	4038000	if you spend how much time today,
4038000	4040000	we may be this kind of measurement
4040000	4042000	is more
4042000	4044000	fit measurement.
4044000	4046000	I'm done, I'm done.
4048000	4050000	If this is the case,
4050000	4052000	we are starting at 8.33 today,
4052000	4054000	I think we
4054000	4056000	can now open to everyone
4056000	4058000	to discuss about
4058000	4060000	9.50,
4060000	4062000	if anyone has a question.
4070000	4072000	In addition to the audience
4072000	4074000	today is the content of the speech
4074000	4076000	if there is a question, if the speaker
4076000	4078000	past research or
4078000	4080000	so on, you can ask
4080000	4082000	questions.
4088000	4090000	If you want to ask a question, you can speak directly.
4094000	4096000	I am Felix.
4098000	4100000	I have a question about oxytocin.
4100000	4102000	Because I saw a document a while ago
4102000	4104000	that said oxytocin
4104000	4106000	seemed to think in the past
4106000	4108000	that it can predict a relationship
4108000	4110000	directly,
4110000	4112000	but that
4112000	4114000	study revealed some documents
4114000	4116000	and found that, for example,
4116000	4118000	in mice, some oxytocin is very
4118000	4120000	high, it even has some aggressive behavior,
4120000	4122000	and then in humans,
4122000	4124000	it seems to be the attachment
4124000	4126000	that affects the
4126000	4128000	effect of oxytocin.
4128000	4130000	I don't know if you have any
4130000	4132000	opinions on this.
4136000	4138000	Have you found that people with high oxytocin
4138000	4140000	don't necessarily spend
4140000	4142000	more time on this?
4144000	4146000	Let's talk about our research first.
4146000	4148000	I haven't analyzed the oxytocin data yet,
4148000	4150000	so I don't know.
4150000	4152000	This is a quick answer.
4152000	4154000	In our lab, another study
4154000	4156000	found that oxytocin level
4156000	4158000	has to interact with social
4158000	4160000	contacts to have better
4160000	4162000	predictability.
4162000	4164000	We found that
4164000	4166000	if your partner is grateful to you,
4166000	4168000	but your
4168000	4170000	expression basically
4170000	4172000	sucks,
4172000	4174000	then your oxytocin level is useless.
4174000	4176000	If you are not a good
4176000	4178000	partner, what are you playing?
4178000	4180000	You are playing something, you know,
4180000	4182000	nothing. So there is an
4182000	4184000	interaction. Your partner
4184000	4186000	is a good partner, and your oxytocin
4186000	4188000	is higher, and their bonding
4188000	4190000	will be stronger.
4192000	4194000	Back to what you just said,
4194000	4196000	I totally agree with
4196000	4198000	what you just said.
4198000	4200000	For those of you who don't know
4200000	4202000	the oxytocin literature
4202000	4204000	or the social regulation function of
4204000	4206000	oxytocin literature, a little background.
4206000	4208000	In this,
4208000	4210000	a lot of news
4210000	4212000	in the first ten years,
4212000	4214000	oxytocin is called
4214000	4216000	love hormone.
4216000	4218000	As long as your oxytocin level is high,
4218000	4220000	you are world peace.
4220000	4222000	Everyone is a good friend.
4222000	4224000	They gave it a name
4224000	4226000	called love hormone.
4226000	4228000	But in the past few years,
4228000	4230000	I feel like everyone is moving
4230000	4232000	in the direction
4232000	4234000	of what Felix just said.
4234000	4236000	What kind of behavior
4236000	4238000	will oxytocin cause
4238000	4240000	has a high interaction
4240000	4242000	effect.
4242000	4244000	Rather than a love hormone,
4244000	4246000	it is a social hormone.
4246000	4248000	If your oxytocin is high,
4248000	4250000	your social sensitivity will be high.
4250000	4252000	So if you are with a good partner,
4252000	4254000	you will have a lot of love.
4254000	4256000	But if you are with
4256000	4258000	your enemy today,
4258000	4260000	you will become very aggressive.
4260000	4262000	It will be more aggressive than
4262000	4264000	it used to be, because you are now
4264000	4266000	very socially sensitive.
4266000	4268000	Rather than a love hormone,
4268000	4270000	it is a bonding hormone
4270000	4272000	or a social regulation hormone.
4272000	4274000	I feel like oxytocin
4274000	4276000	is more like this.
4276000	4278000	My own attitude is that
4278000	4280000	oxytocin should be like this.
4280000	4282000	So I agree with Felix.
4282000	4284000	Thank you.
4286000	4288000	Do you have any questions
4288000	4290000	for the audience?
4292000	4294000	Do you want to ask
4294000	4296000	yourself?
4298000	4300000	Okay.
4300000	4302000	There is a question
4302000	4304000	from the audience.
4304000	4306000	If you want to follow
4306000	4308000	the social distancing rule,
4308000	4310000	if you want to express
4310000	4312000	gratitude to your family
4312000	4314000	or partner through
4314000	4316000	social media,
4316000	4318000	is it useful
4318000	4320000	for bonding?
4320000	4322000	Or do you have
4322000	4324000	any suggestions
4324000	4326000	for this special period?
4326000	4328000	Okay.
4330000	4332000	I don't have data,
4332000	4334000	but I think it's useful.
4334000	4336000	I think it's useful.
4336000	4338000	The reason is that
4338000	4340000	you can imitate
4340000	4342000	other people's behavior
4342000	4344000	and it will be effective.
4344000	4346000	But you don't have to
4346000	4348000	see it face to face.
4348000	4350000	You can still see it
4350000	4352000	if you turn on the video.
4352000	4354000	This is the first one.
4354000	4356000	The second one is
4356000	4358000	about gratitude.
4358000	4360000	There is a similar study
4360000	4362000	done in our next lab.
4362000	4364000	It's like this.
4364000	4366000	It's like
4366000	4368000	asking a veterinarian
4368000	4370000	to come to the lab
4370000	4372000	and watch a funny YouTube video.
4372000	4374000	You've probably seen it.
4374000	4376000	It's a funny YouTube video.
4376000	4378000	At the same time,
4378000	4380000	there is an experiment partner
4380000	4382000	watching it with you.
4382000	4384000	This is another veterinarian.
4384000	4386000	At this time,
4386000	4388000	the two people will watch the video
4388000	4390000	and laugh, right?
4390000	4392000	Because it's a funny video.
4392000	4394000	There are two manipulations.
4394000	4396000	This is an experimental group.
4396000	4398000	One is
4398000	4400000	the partner
4400000	4402000	laughing with the veterinarian
4402000	4404000	at the time of laughing.
4404000	4406000	The other group is laughing
4406000	4408000	when the veterinarian is not laughing.
4408000	4410000	Then the two people
4410000	4412000	find out that
4412000	4414000	after laughing together,
4416000	4418000	there will be a better bonding.
4418000	4420000	Even though
4420000	4422000	their total laughter volume
4422000	4424000	is not high,
4424000	4426000	but there is a
4426000	4428000	countermeasure.
4428000	4430000	Why am I talking about this?
4430000	4432000	Because I just talked about this.
4432000	4434000	The partner is not actually
4434000	4436000	on the spot.
4436000	4438000	He actually used Webcam
4438000	4440000	to laugh.
4440000	4442000	So there is only one person in that space.
4442000	4444000	So it's like social distancing.
4444000	4446000	For example,
4446000	4448000	your partner is far away.
4448000	4450000	I don't know about you, but I'm in Taiwan.
4450000	4452000	Let's say my partner is in New York.
4452000	4454000	Let's spend some time
4454000	4456000	watching a funny video
4456000	4458000	and laughing together.
4458000	4460000	I think it will have a good effect
4460000	4462000	on bonding.
4462000	4464000	The last one is
4464000	4466000	more abstract.
4466000	4468000	But
4470000	4472000	even if there is no video,
4472000	4474000	there is no
4474000	4476000	visual information.
4476000	4478000	Studies have found that
4478000	4480000	when we hear some sounds,
4480000	4482000	our visual cortex
4482000	4484000	will react.
4484000	4486000	It's like we're going to
4486000	4488000	visualize what we hear.
4488000	4490000	So when you read a novel,
4490000	4492000	sometimes it looks like
4492000	4494000	there is a picture, right?
4494000	4496000	Talking on the phone
4496000	4498000	and laughing together
4498000	4500000	even if you don't see people
4500000	4502000	will theoretically have some effect.
4504000	4506000	And anyway,
4506000	4508000	in the process of
4508000	4510000	self-isolation,
4510000	4512000	there are
4512000	4514000	interpersonal relationships,
4514000	4516000	no matter what form, far, near,
4516000	4518000	visual, no visual, only sound,
4518000	4520000	or a card, text, etc.,
4520000	4522000	far better than
4522000	4524000	visual.
4524000	4526000	That's my prediction.
4526000	4528000	I believe there are
4528000	4530000	a lot of data to support it.
4534000	4536000	Our time is up.
4536000	4538000	This is the last question.
4538000	4540000	I don't know if you have any questions.
4540000	4542000	If not,
4542000	4544000	let me summarize
4544000	4546000	and ask you a question.
4546000	4548000	I've learned a lot
4548000	4550000	from your talk today.
4550000	4552000	As someone
4552000	4554000	who cares about marriage,
4554000	4556000	and we're in self-isolation,
4556000	4558000	we're stuck together
4558000	4560000	under the same roof.
4560000	4562000	I've learned a lot
4562000	4564000	from your talk today.
4564000	4566000	I've learned a lot
4566000	4568000	from your talk today.
4568000	4570000	I've learned a lot
4570000	4572000	from your talk today.
4576000	4578000	Do you have anything
4578000	4580000	to say to people
4580000	4582000	to help them
4582000	4584000	implement
4584000	4586000	self-isolation
4586000	4588000	after the pandemic
4588000	4590000	and recovery?
4590000	4594000	Oh, I see.
4594000	4596000	I think
4596000	4598000	implementation and intention
4598000	4600000	are quite fun.
4600000	4602000	You can try to write it down
4602000	4604000	and see what you can do
4604000	4606000	with it.
4606000	4608000	I think if you can
4608000	4610000	use it to help you
4610000	4612000	pay more attention to
4612000	4614000	the things you should be grateful for
4614000	4616000	in your life,
4616000	4618000	it will be very helpful.
4618000	4620000	Why am I talking about
4620000	4622000	the things you should be grateful for
4622000	4624000	in your life,
4624000	4626000	instead of the things you should remember to express?
4626000	4628000	Because
4628000	4630000	research has shown
4630000	4632000	that it is easy to express
4632000	4634000	something that is not sincere.
4634000	4636000	But
4636000	4638000	when you are truly grateful,
4638000	4640000	you may feel
4640000	4642000	that you are not expressing yourself,
4642000	4644000	but others can see it.
4644000	4646000	So for me,
4646000	4648000	it's about being grateful,
4648000	4650000	not expressing it.
4650000	4652000	Implementation and intention
4652000	4654000	is a very effective
4654000	4656000	method that I think
4656000	4658000	can help you achieve this goal.
4658000	4660000	So you can write it down.
4660000	4662000	For example,
4662000	4664000	if he helps me buy breakfast this morning,
4664000	4666000	I will
4666000	4668000	say thank you
4668000	4670000	instead of
4670000	4672000	remembering to say thank you.
4672000	4674000	I will cherish this breakfast
4674000	4676000	that he bought for me.
4676000	4678000	But today,
4678000	4680000	if he helps me buy breakfast every day,
4680000	4682000	I will cherish it.
4682000	4684000	Next,
4684000	4686000	my assumption is that
4686000	4688000	I will express my gratitude
4688000	4690000	smoothly,
4690000	4692000	so I don't need to say it again.
4692000	4694000	But the emotion part is quite important.
4694000	4696000	Okay, I'm done.
4696000	4698000	Okay, time control is very good
4698000	4700000	and very practical.
4700000	4702000	Thank you Dr. Zhang Yanping for
4702000	4704000	joining us today.
4704000	4706000	I hope that everyone
4706000	4708000	has a wonderful and healthy day
4708000	4710000	whether it's day or night.
4710000	4712000	Thank you for your participation today.
4712000	4714000	Thank you Dr. Zhang Yanping.
4714000	4716000	Thank you.
4716000	4718000	Okay, the recording should end here.
4718000	4720000	Okay.
