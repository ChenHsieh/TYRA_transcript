0	14000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's 9.19 Taira Talk. I am the host today, Hong Shi-an.
14000	19000	We are very honored to invite Liao Kun-yan to speak for us today.
19000	26000	Liao Kun-yan is currently a Ph.D. student in the Materials Engineering Department at Tokyo University.
26000	32000	Previously, he obtained a master's and master's degree from the German University of Munich.
32000	38000	He is mainly interested in electronic microscope and neutron scattering material analysis technology.
38000	53000	He is mainly interested in the structure of inorganic glass, the high-angle crystal, and the origin-density spectrum.
53000	61000	Today, he is going to talk about EELS, Electron Energy Low Spectroscopy.
61000	66000	Let's give him a round of applause to welcome him to give us today's talk.
66000	72000	Everyone, please turn on your microphones.
72000	76000	We'll leave the time to you.
76000	78000	Okay.
78000	81000	I'll start now.
81000	84000	The topic of my talk today is EELS.
84000	90000	I want to talk about why it is thought to be a synchrotron in electronic microscopes.
90000	96000	In addition to the introduction just now, let me introduce the department I am in now.
96000	101000	Our department is a department that attaches great importance to electronic microscopes.
101000	105000	We have about 20 electronic microscopes in our department.
105000	111000	We have about four or more electronic microscopes.
111000	122000	Our field includes instrument development, ceramic interface, crystal defects, and quasicrystal crystal.
122000	128000	Our department specializes in EELS and DFT calculation.
128000	137000	In order not to be the same as them, we specialize in non-static, liquid, and gas.
137000	144000	In the past, we have done a lot of liquid and gas EELS.
144000	150000	But this is a special instrument, so I won't talk about it in this talk.
150000	158000	My own research is that I am very interested in glass.
159000	168000	In addition to the fact that most of the glass you see on this screen is transparent and well-balanced material,
168000	174000	if you look at the inside of the glass from a nanometer perspective,
174000	177000	it may have a very small domain.
177000	181000	This is because of the domain caused by its phase separation.
181000	186000	It will also cause it to have different shapes and colors.
186000	189000	It will have different structures and textures.
189000	192000	My first year is mainly to study this.
192000	195000	Today's talk will also talk about some.
195000	202000	This year, my own theme is to adjust to the dopan in the glass.
203000	208000	Is the dopan in the glass a cluster or a particle?
208000	212000	Or is it a dopan that is separated from one atom by one atom?
212000	215000	What impact does it have on the quality of the glass?
215000	217000	This is my own theme.
217000	219000	I won't talk about this today.
219000	229000	Another thing I will mention is that I have measured the thermal expansion coefficient of some crystal surfaces.
229000	232000	I may have a chance to mention it today.
232000	237000	This is related to optical characteristics and PLASMO.
237000	239000	I will mention it later.
239000	247000	Basically, this is the outline of today's speech.
247000	253000	I will first tell you why we want to make electronic microscope.
253000	255000	How do we see the origin?
255000	258000	Finally, I will talk about EOS.
258000	262000	It may take a lot of time in the first half.
262000	267000	After all, I'm not sure what the audience's background is.
267000	271000	So I will talk about what the electronic microscope is doing.
271000	280000	Basically, all microscopes, no matter what particle you use,
280000	289000	The earliest microscope should be the optical microscope invented by Hucke in 1665.
289000	294000	Hucke is the most familiar with its spring, Huckelo.
294000	297000	But in fact, he also did a lot of things.
297000	300000	One of them is the optical microscope.
300000	308000	Then he went through a very simple observation of what the cells and insects look like.
308000	314000	Then he drew it down and got some new knowledge from it.
314000	317000	But this is in 1665.
317000	322000	Of course, for the people at the time, this may be a very incredible research.
322000	325000	Then he really told us a lot of things.
325000	328000	But if you only have optical microscopes,
328000	331000	In fact, it is not enough today.
331000	335000	The reason is that if you only have optical microscopes,
335000	339000	You won't know what happened to us this year.
339000	342000	That is, if you don't have an electronic microscope,
342000	345000	In fact, you can't see the virus.
345000	347000	Then you can't see the coronavirus.
347000	350000	You won't know what happened this year.
350000	355000	This photo is from the Institute of Health in the United States.
355000	360000	Photos of the coronavirus, electronic microscope photos.
360000	363000	Then the one on the right is the structure of the virus.
363000	365000	Photos of the electronic microscope.
365000	367000	It was also published this year.
367000	374000	The electronic microscope seems to have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.
374000	376000	It is also a very popular field.
376000	380000	But I won't mention it because I'm doing it completely.
380000	384000	So we won't discuss the electronic microscope today.
384000	386000	But it is also a powerful tool.
387000	392000	So seeing this kind of small-scale thing,
392000	399000	It is an advantage that makes electronic microscopes unique.
399000	405000	So if you look at it from the perspective of a microscope,
405000	409000	Because what I learned myself is material science.
409000	416000	Material science is a very complicated subject.
416000	420000	The reason is that it is a cross-level problem.
420000	426000	For example, I used to do metal materials.
426000	429000	Suppose you want to design a metal material.
429000	431000	You have to consider a lot of things.
431000	435000	You have to consider what happens to its surface at the level of a microscope.
435000	437000	Is there a crack?
437000	442000	You have to find out how many phases are there in the material.
442000	445000	What is its texture?
445000	447000	Is there any adsorption?
447000	452000	Finally, return to the characteristics of the metal material.
452000	454000	To deal with such a problem,
454000	460000	In fact, we need a lot of different tools in different systems.
460000	466000	For example, if we need EBSD for the level of a microscope,
466000	469000	We need some mechanical tools to measure.
469000	473000	At the level of a microscope, we need high-resolution TEM.
473000	478000	Even if you need a very high-resolution spectrum like AtomPROP
478000	481000	To confirm your chemical composition.
481000	485000	On the other hand, if you are doing simulation,
485000	487000	You will find that the people of mechanics
487000	491000	The most important simulation they do is called Finite Element Method.
491000	496000	Finite Element Method simulates some of the characteristics of mechanics.
496000	499000	But in the Finite Element Method,
499000	501000	You still have to have physical properties.
501000	505000	So you have to do some molecular mechanics,
505000	509000	Modicaro, and even DFT, Programme Mechanics.
509000	511000	So simply put,
511000	515000	If you really want to fully understand material science,
515000	518000	You have to have all of these things.
518000	522000	In comparison, the level of a microscope
522000	527000	In fact, the knowledge we currently have in technology
527000	530000	In fact, it is already very sufficient.
530000	533000	Basically, there is nothing you don't know.
533000	536000	Most of the problems on the level of a microscope can be solved.
536000	538000	But at the level of a microscope,
538000	542000	We will have a lot of difficulties just measuring.
542000	545000	That's why I want to talk about this today.
546000	550000	In particular,
550000	553000	If you look at it from a physical point of view,
553000	556000	In fact, we deal with these problems.
556000	560000	There is a tool called Large-Scale Facility.
560000	565000	That just happens to be STEM, Singleton Radiation, and Neutron Source.
565000	567000	I have done these three experiments.
567000	571000	I also want to briefly talk about their differences.
571000	577000	In general, Taiwan currently has the middle one and the left one.
577000	579000	Some universities in Taiwan have the left one.
579000	582000	The middle one is Neutron Radiation.
582000	584000	Taiwan's Neutron Source.
584000	587000	It is the third generation of Neutron Radiation.
587000	590000	It is also a very powerful method.
590000	593000	There is a big difference between them.
593000	597000	In addition to the type of radiation you use,
597000	601000	This one uses electrons, this one uses light, and this one uses neutrons.
601000	604000	Their sample duration is actually very different.
604000	608000	For example, if you look at a microscope,
608000	612000	The property you get, the amount you get,
612000	615000	Or the area you observe,
615000	617000	It's actually a very small range.
617000	620000	Simply put, there is a saying,
620000	622000	See the tree but not the forest.
622000	626000	You can only see the tree, but you ignore the forest.
626000	629000	A microscope is a bit like looking at a tree.
629000	634000	So your resolution is around nanometers.
634000	636000	It's great.
636000	640000	But if you want to go to a higher resolution,
640000	646000	In fact, Neutron Radiation is a more suitable tool.
646000	650000	Because what you see in your Neutron,
650000	654000	The size of your crystal sample is about micrometers.
654000	658000	If you want to study more industrial problems,
658000	662000	To the size of millimeters, centimeters, or even meters,
662000	666000	Neutron Radiation is a very good choice.
666000	670000	Because you can put a centimeter sample in.
670000	672000	When I was at Muniher,
672000	675000	At that time, there were some BinLine.
675000	677000	Muniher is the headquarters of BMW.
678000	682000	They can put a whole car engine
682000	685000	Put it in the BinLine of Neutron Radiation.
685000	689000	To see some images of its engine.
689000	694000	In addition to the sample size,
694000	698000	Its interaction with matter is also very different.
698000	703000	Neutron, whether you are magnetic radiation or nuclear scattering,
703000	705000	It's all very weak.
705000	707000	It doesn't destroy your sample.
707000	710000	But electrons are easy to destroy.
710000	713000	Or change your sample.
713000	716000	This is also something we need to pay attention to.
716000	719000	If you say so,
719000	721000	There is a big difference.
721000	724000	The middle and the far right,
724000	726000	They are all user facilities.
726000	729000	That is, you don't need to know anyone in there.
729000	733000	You just need to apply for your project.
733000	736000	If your project passes, you can do the experiment.
736000	738000	Even if you have nothing to do with it.
738000	741000	But it's a pity that in the electronic microscope,
741000	744000	In fact, there are not so many user facilities.
744000	748000	So most electronic microscopes are still owned by a small number of people.
748000	750000	If you want to do a similar experiment,
750000	753000	You have to know someone.
753000	756000	There are some user facilities.
756000	760000	At the end of the speech, we will tell everyone.
760000	762000	If you want to do it, you don't know anyone.
762000	764000	You can go there and do it.
764000	766000	It will be put at the end of the speech.
766000	770000	What kind of user facilities can be used?
770000	776000	In fact, people in the past have never thought about
776000	779000	To turn electronic microscopes into
779000	785000	Such a public instrument such as neodymium magnets or copper radiation.
785000	787000	One of the reasons is because
787000	791000	Electronic microscopes were not so powerful at the time.
791000	793000	It can't do so many things.
793000	798000	But recently, it can really do a lot of things.
798000	801000	If you are interested, you can look at this paper.
801000	807000	Why neodymium magnets in electronic microscopes
807000	813000	It really causes electronic microscopes to become a single-chrome radiation.
813000	815000	If you are interested, you can refer to it.
816000	823000	The biggest problem I want to talk about today is
823000	826000	Between me and the audience
826000	830000	Maybe a lot of people have different views on electronic microscopes.
830000	834000	Of course, some people have similar views.
834000	838000	If you are from the Microscopic Society, you may have a closer view.
838000	840000	The first thing I want to talk about is
840000	843000	How do we see atoms?
843000	850000	In fact, this topic has won awards in 2011 and 2020.
850000	854000	Wolf Prize, Cavalier Prize, and Nano Prize
854000	857000	I showed a picture here.
857000	863000	It is a high-resolution TEM image.
863000	867000	Its material is iron.
867000	874000	Iron is a popular topic.
874000	880000	If you don't know much about electronic microscopes,
880000	882000	I think you can ask three questions.
882000	887000	I want to answer these three questions in the next section.
887000	892000	The first thing is how to see such an image.
892000	898000	If you have the opportunity to use an electronic microscope,
898000	903000	Is it easy or difficult to see such an image?
903000	905000	This is the first question.
905000	909000	The second question is if you observe this image
909000	916000	If you look at its atoms, it will have yellow, orange, and blue atoms.
916000	922000	If you look at the left and right, you will find that the orange atom is at the top of the blue atom.
922000	927000	The orange atom is at the bottom of the blue atom on the right.
927000	934000	You will find that we can observe the deviation of several atoms.
934000	939000	The second question is how do I know which atom represents which element?
939000	943000	What kind of atom is the image it sees?
943000	945000	How do we distinguish the atoms?
945000	947000	This is the second question.
947000	951000	The third question is what is not in such an image.
951000	957000	The information in such an image is the electrical field and magnetic field.
957000	959000	If there is an electronic microscope,
959000	965000	I can't see the electrical field and magnetic field with the latest electronic microscope.
965000	967000	This is the third question I want to answer.
968000	971000	Let me give you a brief introduction.
971000	975000	Electronic microscopes are very different from optical microscopes.
975000	981000	But the structure is basically the same.
981000	983000	You have a light source.
983000	985000	This is an electron.
985000	990000	You have a condenser lens.
990000	995000	The only difference is that the optical microscope on the left is a glass lens.
995000	998000	The electron on the right is a conductive electron.
998000	1001000	So you use a magnetic lens to focus on the electron.
1001000	1003000	There is also a sample.
1003000	1004000	There is also a fog lens.
1004000	1006000	There is also a projection lens.
1006000	1012000	So the simplest way to understand is that the electronic microscope is an optical microscope.
1012000	1015000	Just use the electron as a light source.
1015000	1017000	If you understand this way,
1017000	1019000	In fact, most things can be solved.
1019000	1022000	Because most people should have encountered optical microscopes.
1022000	1026000	The only difference is that you need a large electronic microscope.
1026000	1028000	It needs high vacuum.
1028000	1032000	But in addition, you can really use it as an optical microscope.
1032000	1039000	Of course, electrons and substances have different effects.
1039000	1045000	The biggest reason why I use electronic microscopes is
1045000	1052000	In fact, the wavelength of electrons is much smaller than that of normal visible light.
1052000	1061000	If you have studied physics and are familiar with light, you may know that there is a formula called Abbey Diffraction Limit.
1062000	1080000	Basically, what he is talking about is that no matter how small the light is, the resolution will still be limited to the wavelength.
1080000	1084000	This is a physical limit.
1084000	1089000	The maximum resolution is your wavelength divided by 2.
1089000	1098000	Of course, this limit was broken in 2011 by the Super Resolution Optical Microscope.
1098000	1102000	But in general, this is the limit of optical microscopes.
1102000	1111000	If you look at this formula, you can intuitively see that if you want to improve your Abbey Diffraction Limit,
1111000	1116000	You have to find a way to make your wavelength smaller.
1116000	1122000	The reason why I use electrons is actually because of the resources.
1122000	1130000	Because when you apply a very strong electric field, the wavelength of electrons can be very small.
1130000	1138000	For example, if you apply 300 kV, your electronic wavelength can be up to 1 picometer.
1138000	1145000	In principle, you should be able to see the resolution of 1 picometer.
1145000	1148000	But this is actually wrong.
1148000	1150000	Then I will explain why this is wrong.
1150000	1156000	But the basic concept is that the reason you use electrons is because the electromagnetic wavelength is very short.
1156000	1159000	Then it can help you see things more clearly.
1159000	1161000	Why is it wrong?
1161000	1166000	It's because our lens is actually not perfect.
1166000	1173000	There is something called Spherical Aberration Curve.
1173000	1181000	To put it simply, you start from the same point from different angles.
1181000	1189000	You can't actually focus on the same point through different angles.
1189000	1197000	Of course, if you read a high school textbook, it will tell you that no matter which angle you start from, it will focus on a focus point.
1197000	1200000	But in fact, you can't actually focus on a point.
1200000	1206000	To be more specific, what is Spherical Aberration Curve in real life?
1206000	1214000	It's a bit like you take a glass cup and put it on a floor with patterns or sandpaper.
1214000	1219000	You will find that the part you see clearly is only a small area in the middle.
1219000	1221000	But the sides are all curved.
1221000	1225000	This is the reason for Spherical Aberration Curve.
1225000	1232000	The more you move away from the center of the light, the more you can't actually focus on the same point.
1232000	1235000	So what you see is curved.
1236000	1240000	In fact, in the electronic microscope...
1258000	1260000	Can you hear me?
1260000	1264000	Sorry, I'm not sure what happened just now.
1264000	1268000	But there is also this problem in the electronic microscope.
1268000	1275000	So the first thing you see is how to fix this problem.
1275000	1279000	In fact, this story can be recited for a very long time.
1279000	1285000	But simply put, there are four people who contribute in this field respectively.
1285000	1290000	The story began in the early 1940s.
1290000	1295000	After 40 or 50 years of hard work,
1295000	1304000	people found this problem and solved it.
1304000	1312000	The method they used was to use a lot of electronic probes to try to correct this difference.
1312000	1315000	Of course, this electronic probe is a very complicated result.
1315000	1319000	According to my research, in the latest electronic microscope,
1319000	1331000	you need to have 20 layers of this kind of electronic probe to achieve a good resolution.
1331000	1334000	But in short, this is a success.
1334000	1341000	So now we can see the origin through this Spherical Aberration Curve.
1341000	1349000	Most users don't really need to know how to control it.
1349000	1354000	Basically, the maintenance staff will help you adjust it.
1354000	1359000	So if you use an electronic microscope now,
1359000	1362000	how much resolution can you get?
1362000	1363000	I have a picture here.
1363000	1367000	On one side is TEM, and on the other is STEM.
1367000	1371000	The one in the middle is the resolution before correction,
1371000	1375000	and the one in the back is the resolution after correction.
1375000	1378000	Of course, you can't see how well it has changed in this picture.
1378000	1381000	But it's obvious that it's clear.
1381000	1384000	For most people, this is enough.
1384000	1389000	If you look at the picture on the right,
1389000	1393000	it's actually a silicon.
1393000	1398000	There's a certain angle in the middle.
1398000	1402000	If you do a Fourier Transform,
1402000	1406000	you'll see this kind of Diffraction Pattern.
1406000	1409000	It's obvious that if you don't have a corrected picture,
1409000	1415000	the Diffraction Pattern limit you see is about 1.92 Angstrom.
1415000	1417000	If you go through the correction,
1417000	1421000	you can see that the limit is about 0.76 Angstrom.
1421000	1423000	That's 76 picometers.
1423000	1426000	This resolution is probably in 2002.
1426000	1428000	The data I found,
1428000	1430000	if you are a modern electronic microscope,
1430000	1433000	it should be able to reach more than 50 picometers.
1433000	1436000	As mentioned earlier,
1436000	1438000	the Cornell DMV group,
1438000	1440000	if they do Tycography,
1440000	1442000	it can reach 40 picometers.
1442000	1444000	That's the current record.
1444000	1449000	Your resolution is higher than 40 picometers.
1449000	1453000	If you hear this,
1453000	1455000	I think some people may have a question.
1455000	1458000	Why do I need such a high resolution?
1458000	1461000	I'll give you two examples.
1461000	1464000	Why do we need this resolution?
1464000	1467000	The first example is a carbon nanotube.
1467000	1469000	If you look at this picture,
1469000	1470000	the picture on the left,
1470000	1472000	if you don't do analysis,
1472000	1473000	you can't see any difference.
1473000	1475000	This is a very beautiful
1475000	1477000	atomic resolution carbon nanotube.
1477000	1479000	But if you do analysis,
1479000	1481000	every point,
1481000	1482000	intensity,
1482000	1484000	if you do Gaussian fitting,
1484000	1486000	you will find that you can analyze
1486000	1488000	one atom, one atom,
1488000	1490000	how many positions it deviates.
1490000	1493000	You can see this value.
1493000	1497000	This color represents the distance it deviates.
1497000	1499000	All units are picometers.
1499000	1502000	That is, through modern electronic microscope,
1502000	1504000	you can see from the position of the atom,
1504000	1506000	you can know its
1506000	1508000	carbon nanotube
1508000	1510000	the distribution of gravity.
1510000	1512000	Then you can know which atom is deviating.
1512000	1514000	Do this kind of very
1514000	1517000	high-precision measurement.
1517000	1520000	This is very important for imaging.
1520000	1522000	It is also important for EOS,
1522000	1524000	for light sampling.
1524000	1525000	The reason is because
1525000	1527000	if you want to see
1527000	1530000	the light sample of a single atom,
1530000	1532000	you must look at it very clearly
1532000	1535000	to understand which atom is what.
1535000	1537000	This work is
1537000	1539000	Suenaga,
1539000	1541000	he is Japanese,
1541000	1543000	a Japanese broadcaster.
1543000	1546000	The main idea of this work is
1546000	1547000	he wants to look at
1547000	1548000	the green one,
1548000	1551000	the common graphene carbon,
1551000	1553000	and the two-handed carbon
1553000	1554000	on the edge of the graphene,
1554000	1556000	to this one-handed carbon.
1556000	1558000	What is the difference in its light sample?
1558000	1561000	What is its impact on the quality of graphene?
1561000	1563000	He really went to do it.
1563000	1565000	I have a question.
1565000	1567000	Sorry,
1567000	1569000	I'm not an electronic microscope,
1569000	1571000	so I might ask a very out-of-the-way question.
1571000	1573000	You said that your displacement
1573000	1575000	is probably at
1575000	1577000	dozens of picometers,
1577000	1580000	this level.
1580000	1582000	You can probably say
1582000	1584000	how much of this displacement
1584000	1586000	comes from the incident particle,
1586000	1587000	which is your electron,
1587000	1589000	plus the displacement.
1589000	1590000	What is the percentage,
1590000	1592000	or what is the percentage?
1592000	1593000	I don't know.
1593000	1595000	The first thing I want to say is
1595000	1597000	this is
1597000	1598000	how to say it,
1598000	1599000	that is,
1599000	1600000	modern,
1600000	1601000	you can,
1601000	1602000	because electronic microscopes
1602000	1604000	are actually quite long-standing
1604000	1605000	studies,
1605000	1607000	so a lot of information,
1607000	1609000	like how much energy
1609000	1611000	your electron emits
1611000	1613000	to a single atom,
1613000	1614000	you can use calculations,
1614000	1616000	and you can also calculate
1616000	1618000	how much it heats up
1618000	1620000	to a single atom.
1620000	1621000	But what you said,
1621000	1622000	that is,
1622000	1623000	in the end,
1623000	1624000	for example,
1624000	1625000	how much impact
1625000	1627000	it has on carbon nanotubes,
1627000	1630000	this is a very good question.
1630000	1632000	You have to,
1632000	1633000	for each different material,
1633000	1636000	you have to discuss this matter.
1636000	1637000	I can't tell you directly
1637000	1639000	that it probably stands to reason,
1639000	1641000	but I can tell you very clearly
1641000	1642000	that you do today,
1642000	1644000	like this carbon nanotube,
1644000	1647000	the impact of electrons on a single atom
1647000	1648000	is definitely higher than
1648000	1650000	you take it to look at
1650000	1651000	metal or ceramics.
1651000	1652000	Maybe ceramics,
1652000	1653000	you don't even,
1653000	1654000	electrons,
1654000	1655000	that is,
1655000	1656000	your atoms
1656000	1657000	don't cause any change at all.
1657000	1659000	But in this kind of carbon nanotube,
1659000	1660000	indeed,
1660000	1662000	electrons may
1662000	1664000	have an impact on the position of the atom.
1664000	1666000	But I can't tell you
1666000	1667000	exactly how much
1667000	1668000	it accounts for.
1668000	1670000	Sorry.
1670000	1671000	Yes, I understand.
1671000	1672000	Thank you.
1672000	1673000	Yes,
1673000	1675000	simply put,
1675000	1676000	of course,
1676000	1677000	the question you just asked
1677000	1680000	is also a very practical question.
1680000	1682000	You have to
1682000	1684000	study this matter.
1684000	1687000	But simply put,
1687000	1689000	because there is a spherical refractor,
1689000	1692000	we can see the atom very accurately.
1692000	1693000	That is,
1693000	1695000	people who do EOS
1695000	1696000	can go to
1696000	1698000	each atom,
1698000	1699000	each single atom,
1699000	1700000	to see what is the difference
1700000	1701000	between its light waves,
1701000	1702000	such as green,
1702000	1703000	blue,
1703000	1704000	and red.
1704000	1706000	There are some differences.
1706000	1707000	Of course,
1707000	1709000	green and blue
1709000	1710000	may be very different,
1710000	1711000	and blue and red
1711000	1712000	may not be so different.
1712000	1714000	But if you do the calculation,
1714000	1715000	you can know
1715000	1716000	why they are different,
1716000	1718000	and what the difference
1718000	1719000	means.
1719000	1721000	This can be interpreted.
1721000	1722000	Sorry,
1722000	1724000	I have a question.
1724000	1725000	OK.
1725000	1726000	Yes,
1726000	1727000	can you hear me?
1727000	1728000	Yes,
1728000	1729000	I can hear you.
1729000	1730000	You can hear me.
1730000	1731000	How do you look at
1731000	1732000	the energy loss
1732000	1733000	in the 2D
1733000	1734000	part?
1734000	1735000	In theory
1735000	1736000	or in practice,
1736000	1737000	how do you look at
1737000	1738000	this thing?
1738000	1739000	What kind of energy loss
1739000	1740000	does it have?
1740000	1741000	I will put it
1741000	1742000	in the second session.
1742000	1743000	I will put EOS's structure 2.
1743000	1744000	But simply put,
1744000	1745000	you see this image.
1745000	1746000	In fact,
1746000	1747000	it is
1747000	1748000	EOS's structure 2.
1748000	1749000	It is
1749000	1750000	EOS's structure 2.
1750000	1751000	It is
1751000	1752000	EOS's structure 2.
1752000	1753000	It is
1753000	1754000	EOS's structure 2.
1754000	1755000	It is
1755000	1756000	EOS's structure 2.
1756000	1757000	In fact,
1757000	1758000	because you
1758000	1759000	have a
1759000	1760000	regressed electron,
1760000	1761000	you
1761000	1762000	are
1762000	1763000	detecting
1763000	1764000	the energy
1764000	1765000	loss
1765000	1766000	of the
1766000	1767000	regressed electron.
1767000	1768000	So EOS
1768000	1769000	is usually
1769000	1770000	placed at the
1770000	1771000	bottom of
1771000	1772000	the electron microscope
1772000	1773000	.
1773000	1774000	A
1774000	1775000	general
1775000	1776000	instrument
1776000	1777000	is placed
1777000	1778000	at the
1778000	1779000	bottom.
1779000	1780000	You
1780000	1781000	put the
1781000	1782000	light
1782000	1783000	spectrum
1783000	1784000	like this
1784000	1785000	and
1785000	1786000	analyze the
1786000	1787000	energy loss
1787000	1788000	of the
1788000	1789000	same electron.
1789000	1790000	Then you can
1790000	1791000	see the
1791000	1792000	light spectrum
1792000	1793000	like this.
1793000	1794000	I will
1794000	1795000	talk about
1795000	1796000	the specific
1796000	1797000	structure
1797000	1798000	in the
1798000	1799000	next
1799000	1800000	section.
1800000	1801000	Okay,
1801000	1802000	the part
1802000	1803000	I just
1803000	1804000	talked about
1804000	1805000	is about
1805000	1806000	how we
1806000	1807000	can see
1807000	1808000	an electron
1808000	1809000	very precisely
1809000	1810000	.
1810000	1811000	This matter
1811000	1812000	is very
1812000	1813000	important.
1813000	1814000	Because
1814000	1815000	if you can't see
1815000	1816000	the electron,
1816000	1817000	you can't
1817000	1818000	study the
1818000	1819000	light spectrum
1819000	1820000	of the
1820000	1821000	electron.
1821000	1822000	The
1822000	1823000	red frame
1823000	1824000	here
1824000	1825000	is the
1825000	1826000	element
1826000	1827000	that
1827000	1828000	ordinary
1828000	1829000	people
1829000	1830000	will
1830000	1831000	encounter.
1831000	1832000	The
1832000	1833000	element that
1833000	1834000	is not listed
1834000	1835000	below
1835000	1836000	may not
1836000	1837000	be an
1837000	1838000	element
1838000	1839000	that
1839000	1840000	ordinary
1840000	1841000	people
1841000	1842000	will
1842000	1843000	encounter.
1843000	1844000	Let me
1844000	1845000	give you an
1845000	1846000	example.
1846000	1847000	You can
1847000	1848000	think about
1848000	1849000	what you
1849000	1850000	expect to
1850000	1851000	see in
1851000	1852000	the electron
1852000	1853000	.
1853000	1854000	The
1854000	1855000	answer is
1855000	1856000	that all
1856000	1857000	the elements
1857000	1858000	in this
1858000	1859000	frame can
1859000	1860000	be seen,
1860000	1861000	including
1861000	1862000	light and
1862000	1863000	light.
1863000	1864000	I have
1864000	1865000	a picture
1865000	1866000	here.
1866000	1867000	The
1867000	1868000	most important
1868000	1869000	element
1869000	1870000	I just
1870000	1871000	talked about
1871000	1872000	is the
1872000	1873000	light
1873000	1874000	element.
1874000	1875000	This is
1875000	1876000	my
1876000	1877000	recent experiment.
1877000	1878000	You can
1878000	1879000	see the
1879000	1880000	white
1880000	1881000	bismuth
1881000	1882000	forming
1882000	1883000	particles
1883000	1884000	or
1884000	1885000	single
1885000	1886000	atoms.
1886000	1887000	In the
1887000	1888000	glass,
1888000	1889000	bismuth
1889000	1890000	is definitely
1890000	1891000	something
1891000	1892000	that
1892000	1893000	is easy
1893000	1894000	to see.
1894000	1895000	The
1895000	1896000	light element
1896000	1897000	is special
1897000	1898000	because it
1898000	1899000	has only
1899000	1900000	one
1900000	1901000	light
1901000	1902000	element.
1902000	1903000	The
1903000	1904000	first time
1904000	1905000	it was
1905000	1906000	seen was
1906000	1907000	in 2011
1907000	1908000	in the
1908000	1909000	YH
1909000	1910000	crystal.
1910000	1911000	You
1911000	1912000	can see
1912000	1913000	the
1913000	1914000	faint
1914000	1915000	intensity,
1915000	1916000	but
1916000	1917000	basically
1917000	1918000	you can
1918000	1919000	see the
1919000	1920000	light
1920000	1921000	element.
1921000	1922000	This
1922000	1923000	method,
1923000	1924000	in fact,
1924000	1925000	the first
1925000	1926000	method to
1926000	1927000	do this
1927000	1928000	is the
1928000	1929000	method
1929000	1930000	that
1930000	1931000	you can
1931000	1932000	see the
1932000	1933000	light
1933000	1934000	element.
1934000	1935000	Of
1935000	1936000	course,
1936000	1937000	it's not
1937000	1938000	that simple,
1938000	1939000	but
1939000	1940000	theoretically
1940000	1941000	you can
1941000	1942000	see the
1942000	1943000	light
1943000	1944000	element.
1944000	1945000	The
1945000	1946000	first
1946000	1947000	question
1947000	1948000	I'm
1948000	1949000	going to
1949000	1950000	talk about
1950000	1951000	today is
1951000	1952000	that
1952000	1953000	many people
1953000	1954000	seem to
1954000	1955000	be doing
1955000	1956000	STEM,
1956000	1957000	but
1957000	1958000	no one
1958000	1959000	knows
1959000	1960000	why.
1960000	1961000	This is
1961000	1962000	not a
1962000	1963000	traditional
1963000	1964000	electron microscope.
1964000	1965000	It's a
1965000	1966000	technology
1966000	1967000	called
1967000	1968000	STEM.
1968000	1969000	It's
1969000	1970000	very different
1970000	1971000	from a
1971000	1972000	optical
1972000	1973000	microscope.
1973000	1974000	STEM
1974000	1975000	actually
1975000	1976000	focuses
1976000	1977000	the
1977000	1978000	electron
1978000	1979000	into a
1979000	1980000	very small
1980000	1981000	probe
1981000	1982000	and then
1982000	1983000	does
1983000	1984000	scanning.
1984000	1985000	The
1985000	1986000	traditional
1986000	1987000	optical
1987000	1988000	microscope
1988000	1989000	will
1989000	1990000	look
1990000	1991000	very
1991000	1992000	different.
1992000	1993000	To
1993000	1994000	put it
1994000	1995000	simply,
1995000	1996000	because
1996000	1997000	it does
1997000	1998000	this
1998000	1999000	scanning,
1999000	2000000	it can
2000000	2001000	put
2001000	2002000	detectors
2002000	2003000	at different
2003000	2004000	angles
2004000	2005000	in different
2005000	2006000	places.
2006000	2007000	These
2007000	2008000	detectors
2008000	2009000	can
2009000	2010000	tell you
2010000	2011000	different
2011000	2012000	information
2012000	2013000	in
2013000	2014000	different
2014000	2015000	places.
2015000	2016000	The
2016000	2017000	electron
2017000	2018000	microscope
2018000	2019000	is
2019000	2020000	very
2020000	2021000	sensitive
2021000	2022000	to
2022000	2023000	the
2023000	2024000	intensity
2024000	2025000	of the
2025000	2026000	electron.
2026000	2027000	You
2027000	2028000	can
2028000	2029000	tell
2029000	2030000	the
2030000	2031000	intensity
2031000	2032000	of the
2032000	2033000	electron
2033000	2034000	by
2034000	2035000	looking at
2035000	2036000	the
2036000	2037000	intensity
2037000	2038000	of the
2038000	2039000	electron.
2039000	2040000	The
2040000	2041000	other
2041000	2042000	technology
2042000	2043000	is
2043000	2044000	the
2044000	2045000	brightfield
2045000	2046000	microscope.
2046000	2047000	It
2047000	2048000	is
2048000	2049000	similar to
2049000	2050000	the
2050000	2051000	TEM
2051000	2052000	microscope.
2052000	2053000	The
2053000	2054000	last
2054000	2055000	technology is
2055000	2056000	the
2056000	2057000	detector.
2057000	2058000	It
2058000	2059000	is
2059000	2060000	very
2060000	2061000	sensitive
2061000	2062000	to
2062000	2063000	light
2063000	2064000	particles.
2064000	2065000	In
2065000	2066000	other
2066000	2067000	words,
2067000	2068000	if
2068000	2069000	you
2069000	2070000	have
2070000	2071000	a
2071000	2072000	small
2072000	2073000	electron
2073000	2074000	in
2074000	2075000	the
2075000	2076000	microscope,
2076000	2077000	you
2077000	2078000	can
2078000	2079000	detect
2079000	2080000	light
2080000	2081000	particles
2081000	2082000	in
2082000	2083000	a
2083000	2084000	small
2084000	2085000	electron.
2085000	2086000	You
2086000	2087000	can
2087000	2088000	detect
2088000	2089000	light
2089000	2090000	particles
2090000	2091000	in
2091000	2092000	a

2093000	2094000	electron.
2094000	2095000	You
2095000	2096000	can
2096000	2097000	detect
2097000	2098000	light
2098000	2099000	particles
2099000	2100000	in
2100000	2101000	a
2101000	2102000	small
2102000	2103000	electron.
2103000	2104000	You
2104000	2105000	can
2105000	2106000	detect
2106000	2107000	light
2107000	2108000	particles
2108000	2109000	in
2109000	2110000	a
2110000	2111000	small
2111000	2112000	electron.
2112000	2113000	It
2113000	2116000	is
2116000	2117000	a
2117000	2118000	very
2118000	2119000	sensitive
2119000	2120000	technology.
2120000	2121000	It
2121000	2122000	is
2122000	2123000	a
2123000	2124000	very
2124000	2125000	sensitive
2125000	2126000	technology.
2126000	2127000	It
2127000	2128000	is
2128000	2129000	a
2129000	2130000	very
2130000	2131000	sensitive
2131000	2132000	technology.
2132000	2133140	For
2133140	2134020	this
2134020	2135140	case,
2135140	2136140	let me
2136140	2137140	show
2137140	2138140	you
2138140	2139140	how
2139140	2140140	important
2140140	2141140	this
2141140	2142140	thing in
2142140	2143140	science
2143140	2144140	is.
2144140	2144940	This
2144940	2146180	is an
2146180	2147140	experiment
2147140	2148140	tailor-made
2148140	2149140	project
2149140	2150140	that
2150140	2151140	studies
2151140	2152140	Gold
2152140	2155640	in
2155640	2156500	liquid
2156500	2158500	ions.
2158500	2159500	This
2159500	2160400	is their
2160400	2161400	an original
2161400	2162400	image,
2162400	2163400	but
2163400	2164400	I don't know
2164400	2165400	if there is
2165400	2166400	any contrast
2166400	2167400	in this
2167400	2168400	picture,
2168400	2169400	that is,
2169400	2170400	there are some
2170400	2171400	lines,
2171400	2172400	but
2172400	2173400	you can't
2173400	2174400	see anything.
2174400	2175400	But
2175400	2176400	if you go
2176400	2177400	to the
2177400	2178400	hard
2178400	2179400	depth
2179400	2180400	image,
2180400	2181400	you will
2181400	2182400	find that
2182400	2183400	there are
2183400	2184400	actually
2184400	2185400	a lot of
2185400	2186400	gold ions
2186400	2187400	in
2187400	2188400	this
2188400	2189400	picture.
2189400	2190400	It
2190400	2191400	turns out
2191400	2192400	that
2192400	2193400	if you
2193400	2194400	do
2194400	2195400	such
2195400	2196400	research,
2196400	2197400	gold ions
2197400	2198400	can be
2198400	2199400	distinguished from
2199400	2200400	gold ions
2200400	2201400	and
2201400	2202400	it
2202400	2203400	becomes
2203400	2204400	a very
2204400	2205400	important
2205400	2206400	thing.
2206400	2207400	From
2207400	2208400	this
2208400	2209400	point of
2209400	2210400	view,
2210400	2211400	you
2211400	2212400	can't
2212400	2213400	see
2213400	2214400	anything
2214400	2215400	at
2215400	2216400	all.
2216400	2217400	On
2217400	2218400	the other
2218400	2219400	hand,
2219400	2220400	there
2220400	2221400	are several
2221400	2222400	ways.
2222400	2223400	The first
2223400	2224400	thing is that
2224400	2225400	this picture
2225400	2226400	is actually a
2226400	2227400	lithium-ion
2227400	2228400	liquid.
2228400	2229400	I forgot
2229400	2230400	whether it
2230400	2231400	was steam
2231400	2232400	or something,
2232400	2233400	but there is
2233400	2234400	a low
2234400	2235400	physical
2235400	2236400	mass,
2236400	2237400	so it
2237400	2238400	will not
2238400	2239400	become
2239400	2240400	gas in
2240400	2241400	vacuum.
2241400	2242400	You can
2242400	2243400	put it
2243400	2244400	in.
2244400	2245400	This is
2245400	2246400	a general
2246400	2247400	electronic
2247400	2248400	microscope.
2248400	2249400	If you
2249400	2250400	allow it,
2250400	2251400	you can put it
2251400	2252400	in.
2252400	2253400	In fact,
2253400	2254400	many people
2254400	2255400	don't like
2255400	2256400	doing this,
2256400	2257400	but in
2257400	2258400	principle,
2258400	2259400	it is physically
2259400	2260400	safe.
2260400	2261400	Another
2261400	2262400	method
2262400	2263400	is
2263400	2264400	called
2264400	2265400	a
2265400	2266400	liquid
2266400	2267400	holder.
2267400	2268400	It
2268400	2269400	has a
2269400	2270400	special
2270400	2271400	holder
2271400	2272400	that you
2272400	2273400	can put
2273400	2274400	liquid
2274400	2275400	in.
2275400	2276400	These
2276400	2277400	things
2277400	2278400	are
2278400	2279400	very thin.
2279400	2280400	My
2280400	2281400	understanding
2281400	2282400	is that
2282400	2283400	EM
2283400	2284400	has to be
2284400	2285400	cut very
2285400	2286400	thin.
2286400	2287400	Yes,
2287400	2288400	this
2288400	2289400	situation is
2289400	2290400	a bit like
2290400	2291400	a
2291400	2292400	lithium-ion
2292400	2293400	liquid.
2293400	2294400	There
2294400	2295400	should be
2295400	2296400	a
2296400	2297400	molybdenum
2297400	2298400	or copper
2298400	2299400	grid
2299400	2300400	on the
2300400	2301400	outside
2301400	2302400	.
2302400	2303400	At
2303400	2304400	the
2304400	2305400	beginning,
2305400	2306400	it
2306400	2307400	is
2307400	2308400	very
2308400	2309400	thin,
2309400	2310400	but
2310400	2311400	if you
2311400	2312400	heat it
2312400	2313400	a little
2313400	2314400	in the
2314400	2315400	vacuum
2315400	2316400	furnace,
2316400	2317400	it
2317400	2318400	will
2318400	2319400	actually
2319400	2320400	become
2320400	2321400	a film
2321400	2322400	like this
2322400	2323400	and
2323400	2324400	its
2324400	2325400	thickness
2325400	2326400	is
2326400	2327400	about
2327400	2328400	10 nanometers
2328400	2329400	.
2329400	2330400	This
2330400	2331400	material
2331400	2332400	can do
2332400	2333400	this.
2333400	2334400	This
2334400	2335400	material
2335400	2336400	is
2336400	2337400	very
2337400	2338400	thin
2338400	2339400	and
2339400	2340400	quite
2340400	2341400	mature.
2341400	2342400	The
2342400	2343400	most famous
2343400	2344400	is
2344400	2345400	Berkeley
2345400	2346400	Lawrence
2346400	2347400	Lab.
2347400	2348400	He
2348400	2349400	has done
2349400	2350400	a lot of
2350400	2351400	liquid experiments.
2351400	2352400	Didn't
2352400	2353400	they say
2353400	2354400	to wrap
2354400	2355400	things up
2355400	2356400	with
2356400	2357400	graphene?
2357400	2358400	That's
2358400	2359400	also a
2359400	2360400	method,
2360400	2361400	but
2361400	2362400	you
2362400	2363400	think about it
2363400	2364400	yourself,
2364400	2365400	it's
2365400	2366400	really in the
2366400	2367400	liquid environment.
2367400	2368400	The graphene
2368400	2369400	you just
2369400	2370400	talked about is
2370400	2371400	also a method,
2371400	2372400	but the
2372400	2373400	current mainstream
2373400	2374400	is to
2374400	2375400	use a
2375400	2376400	special
2376400	2377400	microwave holder
2377400	2378400	.
2378400	2379400	You can
2379400	2380400	really put
2380400	2381400	liquid in
2381400	2382400	.
2382400	2383400	Generally
2383400	2384400	it is
2384400	2385400	silicon nitride.
2385400	2386400	OK,
2386400	2387400	so it
2387400	2388400	is also
2388400	2389400	silicon nitride.
2389400	2390400	Thank
2390400	2391400	you.
2391400	2392400	The
2392400	2393400	other one
2393400	2394400	is
2394400	2395400	lithium
2395400	2396400	atom.
2396400	2397400	Everyone
2397400	2398400	is studying
2398400	2399400	lithium
2399400	2400400	atoms.
2400400	2401400	Our
2401400	2402400	department
2402400	2403400	originally
2403400	2404400	studied
2404400	2405400	ceramics.
2405400	2406400	He just
2406400	2407400	thought
2407400	2408400	lithium
2408400	2409400	atoms were
2409400	2410400	quite
2410400	2411400	interesting,
2411400	2412400	so he
2412400	2413400	used
2413400	2414400	ABF
2414400	2415400	as I
2415400	2416400	just
2416400	2417400	said.
2417400	2418400	We
2418400	2419400	developed a
2419400	2420400	method
2420400	2421400	to look at
2421400	2422400	lithium
2422400	2423400	atoms.
2423400	2424400	But
2424400	2425400	if you
2425400	2426400	charge it,
2426400	2427400	it will
2427400	2428400	run out
2428400	2429400	if you
2429400	2430400	don't
2430400	2431400	see it.
2431400	2432400	Then
2432400	2433400	you can
2433400	2434400	come in
2434400	2435400	by
2435400	2436400	health
2436400	2437400	charging.
2437400	2438400	Then
2438400	2439400	you can
2439400	2440400	judge
2440400	2441400	it by
2441400	2442400	intensity
2442400	2443400	.
2443400	2444400	If
2444400	2445400	you are
2445400	2446400	studying
2446400	2447400	lithium
2447400	2448400	atoms,
2448400	2449400	the
2449400	2450400	current
2450400	2451400	microwave
2451400	2452400	will
2452400	2453400	run out
2453400	2454400	if you
2454400	2455400	don't
2455400	2456400	charge
2456400	2457400	it.
2457400	2458400	So
2458400	2459400	that's
2459400	2460400	why we
2460400	2461400	don't
2461400	2462400	need
2462400	2463400	lithium
2463400	2464400	atom
2464400	2465400	technology.
2465400	2466400	Yes.
2466400	2467400	Finally,
2467400	2468400	I'm not
2468400	2469400	sure how
2469400	2470400	many people
2470400	2471400	are
2471400	2472400	interested
2472400	2473400	in
2473400	2474400	magnetic
2474400	2475400	and
2475400	2476400	electrical
2476400	2477400	fields.
2477400	2478400	This
2478400	2479400	has nothing
2479400	2480400	to do
2480400	2481400	with
2481400	2482400	electrical
2482400	2483400	or magnetic
2483400	2484400	fields.
2484400	2485400	Electrical
2485400	2486400	fields will
2486400	2487400	tell you
2487400	2488400	the direction
2488400	2489400	of the magnetic
2489400	2490400	field.
2490400	2491400	In the
2491400	2492400	past,
2492400	2493400	if you
2493400	2494400	only had
2494400	2495400	one detector
2495400	2496400	and
2496400	2497400	didn't
2497400	2498400	have a
2498400	2499400	block,
2499400	2500400	you
2500400	2501400	couldn't
2501400	2502400	tell
2502400	2503400	the
2503400	2504400	magnetic
2504400	2505400	field
2505400	2506400	or
2506400	2507400	magnetic
2507400	2508400	field
2508400	2509400	from
2509400	2510400	the
2510400	2511400	other
2511400	2512400	detectors.
2512400	2513400	So
2513400	2514400	if you
2514400	2515400	only had
2515400	2516400	one
2516400	2517400	detector and
2517400	2518400	didn't
2518400	2519400	have a
2519400	2520400	block,
2520400	2521400	you
2521400	2522400	couldn't
2522400	2523400	tell
2523400	2524400	the
2524400	2525400	magnetic
2525400	2526400	field
2526400	2527400	or
2527400	2528400	magnetic
2528400	2529400	field
2529400	2530400	from
2530400	2531400	the
2531400	2532400	other
2532400	2533400	detectors.
2533400	2534400	So
2534400	2535400	if you
2535400	2536400	only had
2536400	2537400	one
2537400	2538400	detector
2538400	2539400	and
2539400	2540400	didn't
2540400	2541400	have a
2541400	2542400	block,
2542400	2543400	you
2543400	2544400	couldn't
2544400	2545400	tell
2545400	2546400	the
2546400	2547400	magnetic
2547400	2548400	field
2548400	2549400	or
2549400	2550400	magnetic
2550400	2551400	field
2551400	2552400	from
2552400	2553400	the
2553400	2554400	other
2554400	2555400	detectors.
2555400	2556400	So
2556400	2557400	if you
2557400	2558400	only had
2558400	2559400	one
2559400	2560400	detector
2560400	2561400	and
2561400	2562400	didn't
2562400	2563400	have a
2563400	2564400	block,
2564400	2565400	you
2565400	2566400	couldn't
2566400	2567400	tell
2567400	2568400	the
2568400	2569400	magnetic
2569400	2570400	field
2570400	2571400	from
2571400	2572400	the
2572400	2573400	other
2573400	2574400	detectors.
2574400	2575400	So
2575400	2576400	if you
2576400	2577400	only had
2577400	2578400	one
2578400	2579400	detector and
2579400	2580400	didn't
2580400	2581400	have a
2581400	2582400	block,
2582400	2583400	you
2583400	2584400	couldn't
2584400	2585400	tell
2585400	2586400	the
2586400	2587400	magnetic
2587400	2588400	field
2588400	2589400	from
2589400	2590400	the
2590400	2591400	other
2591400	2592400	detectors.
2592400	2593400	So
2593400	2594400	if you
2594400	2595400	only had
2595400	2596400	one
2596400	2597400	detector
2597400	2598400	and
2598400	2599400	didn't
2599400	2600400	have a
2600400	2601400	block,
2601400	2602400	you
2602400	2603400	couldn't
2603400	2604400	tell the
2604400	2605400	magnetic

2607400	2608400	the
2608400	2609400	other
2609400	2610400	detectors.
2610400	2611400	So
2611400	2612400	if you
2612400	2613400	only had
2613400	2614400	one
2614400	2615400	detector and

2623400	2624400	from
2624400	2625400	the
2625400	2626400	other
2626400	2627400	detectors.
2627400	2628400	So
2628400	2629400	if you
2629400	2630400	only had
2630400	2631400	one
2631400	2632400	detector and

2641400	2642400	the other
2642400	2643400	detectors.
2643400	2644400	So
2644400	2645400	if you
2645400	2646400	only had
2646400	2647400	one
2647400	2648400	detector and

2659400	2660400	So

2851400	2852400	So
2852400	2853400	if you

2854400	2855400	one
2855400	2856400	detector and

2867400	2868400	So

2883400	2884400	So
2884400	2885400	if you

2897400	2898400	the other
2898400	2899400	detectors.
2899400	2900400	So
2900400	2901400	spectroscopy
2901400	2902400	is very
2902400	2903400	important.
2903400	2904400	Of course
2904400	2905400	my time
2905400	2906400	is very
2906400	2907400	limited,
2907400	2908400	but
2908400	2909400	I can
2909400	2910400	simply
2910400	2911400	say that
2911400	2912400	EOS
2912400	2913400	is usually
2913400	2914400	at the
2914400	2915400	bottom
2915400	2916400	of
2916400	2917400	the
2917400	2918400	sample.
2918400	2919400	So
2919400	2920400	EOS
2920400	2921400	is
2921400	2922400	basically
2922400	2923400	IR
2923400	2924400	plus
2924400	2925400	Raman

3182400	3190400	In many of the blue squares, I have 5 to 6 hands.
3190400	3195400	This can tell you a lot about the nature of glass.
3195400	3203400	It can also tell you, for example, how many 5 or 6 hands you have on a point.
3203400	3208400	It will affect the nature of glass.
3208400	3215400	This is basically the information you can get from the structure map.
3215400	3223400	Other than that, I don't know, maybe a lot of people are interested in Transition Metal.
3223400	3228400	For example, you can have a 2-frame mesh and a 3-frame mesh.
3228400	3234400	If you just look at the image or the deflection, you can't tell.
3234400	3240400	But if you use EOS, you will find that the light source is in a different position.
3240400	3245400	If we don't mention the calculation, this is what it looks like in practice.
3245400	3248400	You have two atoms here, one is A and the other is B.
3248400	3252400	Then you also look at MnL2Cag.
3252400	3259400	You will find that the light source of EOS will change slightly between different atoms.
3259400	3273400	If you use EOS to calculate, you will find that the light source of 2Cag is in the middle, and the light source of 3Cag is outside.
3273400	3277400	This can tell you a lot of information.
3277400	3284400	In addition to knowing the location of the light source, you can also know the oxidation state of the light source.
3285400	3290400	Some EOS can even tell you if there is a transfer of electrons.
3290400	3297400	So far, this is basically what everyone is doing.
3297400	3302400	Doing this in practice is actually quite simple.
3302400	3305400	If you are interested, you can try it yourself.
3305400	3307400	In fact, this is not that difficult.
3308400	3313400	This is basically the most common application of Coros.
3313400	3318400	It's like this, 2Cag, 3Cag, 4Cag, this kind of balance state mapping.
3320400	3323400	Let me make a simple comparison here.
3323400	3329400	The EOS I just talked about is actually XAS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
3329400	3331400	In fact, it is very similar to the EOS function.
3331400	3334400	But their energy boundaries are not quite the same.
3334400	3339400	X-ray absorption is basically greater than the energy of 2KeV.
3339400	3343400	EOS is basically 1mEV to 10KeV.
3343400	3347400	The energy resolution is not much different now.
3347400	3353400	But if you add the non-committer, the latest EOS record can be up to 3mEV.
3353400	3357400	You can use it to study the body.
3357400	3360400	But the spatial resolution is very different.
3360400	3366400	The spatial resolution of XAS is about 50nm to micrometer.
3366400	3370400	In the case of EOS, you can go to angstrom to nanometer.
3372400	3377400	So if you are more interested in some nanometers,
3377400	3381400	you can consider doing an EOS experiment.
3381400	3384400	Then you can compare it with Bokeh.
3385400	3391400	The second section I want to talk about is the VALENCE section.
3391400	3394400	It is more about the transfer of light and snow.
3394400	3398400	You can think of it as the energy obtained in this section.
3398400	3403400	In fact, it has something to do with your relay parameters.
3403400	3405400	This is a raw data.
3405400	3410400	If you do fitting, you will find that there are different peaks in this fitting.
3411400	3418400	Some of them come from PLASMO, some of them come from the interband transition.
3418400	3425400	You may know that the VALENCE band is usually at the top and the CONDUCTION band is at the bottom.
3425400	3432400	This is the definition of the band gap between LUMO and LUMO.
3432400	3436400	If you use EOS, you can do the same thing.
3437400	3441400	We don't have time to go through the SURFACE PLASMO.
3441400	3453400	What I think is more interesting is that we can measure the band gap of some interfaces in some very special materials.
3453400	3457400	For example, the material here is actually oxidized aluminum.
3457400	3462400	Oxidized aluminum has different angles in the oxidized aluminum of polyethylene.
3462400	3464400	This is a metal defect.
3464400	3471400	If you measure its EOS, you will find that the black one is Bokeh.
3471400	3473400	Bokeh is basically the same.
3473400	3479400	But you will find that the red one has two band gaps in this interface.
3479400	3482400	In fact, each one is different.
3482400	3484400	You can analyze it.
3484400	3488400	For example, in the interface, your band gap becomes 6.7.
3488400	3489400	Originally it was 8.8.
3489400	3493400	What impact will this matter to your material quality?
3493400	3498400	You can also analyze how the interface will have a lower band gap.
3498400	3501400	How do you control this?
3501400	3506400	If you are a semiconductor person, this is very interesting.
3506400	3510400	Because you can measure a lot of interfaces in your software.
3510400	3513400	Is it good or bad for you?
3514400	3518400	I also think that the band gap measurement is not that simple.
3518400	3523400	But basically, EOS instruments can do this.
3523400	3527400	You can try it.
3527400	3533400	The last section is Valence EOS.
3533400	3535400	This section is a special one.
3535400	3539400	It is interesting that it can measure temperature.
3539400	3549400	The principle is to use Profile Fitting to feed PLASMON's energy.
3549400	3552400	Because its energy is related to the density of the electrode.
3552400	3555400	So if you change the temperature, the density of the electrode will change.
3555400	3558400	You can measure the temperature.
3558400	3567400	This diagram is a very simple temperature mapping.
3567400	3570400	This material is aluminum.
3570400	3575400	I'm not sure if it's a wet electrode or a wet electrode.
3575400	3577400	It should be a wet electrode.
3577400	3582400	You can see the temperature change in the aluminum.
3582400	3585400	Of course, it's not that simple.
3585400	3588400	But it can still be done.
3588400	3591400	This is the part of measuring temperature.
3592400	3594400	I've been doing it recently.
3594400	3596400	It's a bit like what I just said.
3596400	3602400	I'm going to measure the EOS changes in the interface.
3602400	3604400	It's not the same as the above.
3604400	3606400	I'm going to measure thermal expansion.
3606400	3609400	If you're interested, we can discuss it next.
3612400	3614400	Can I ask a question?
3614400	3615400	Yes.
3616400	3622400	Can you go back to the aluminum diagram?
3622400	3624400	The temperature next to you is almost normal.
3624400	3626400	Can you make it a little warmer?
3626400	3628400	Can you make it very low?
3628400	3630400	You mean low temperature?
3630400	3632400	Low enough that it doesn't overheat.
3632400	3634400	It's less than 1K.
3634400	3639400	I think it should be physically possible.
3639400	3641400	Because the way it gets the temperature is
3641400	3647400	Simply put, if you look at the peak shift of Plasmon Peak,
3647400	3652400	You can see how much the electronic density has changed.
3652400	3655400	If you get low temperature,
3655400	3659400	You may also know how low it is.
3659400	3661400	But in the electronic microscope,
3661400	3665400	It's easier to heat than to get low temperature.
3665400	3667400	So most people do thermal experiments.
3667400	3670400	Very few people do low temperature experiments.
3671400	3673400	Can I say something?
3673400	3674400	Yes.
3674400	3678400	Basically, I don't think you should say this in this picture.
3678400	3681400	Because I've talked to the author about this.
3681400	3688400	This sample itself is a silicon nitride membrane.
3688400	3690400	To carve out these patterns.
3690400	3693400	So when you're doing this experiment,
3693400	3695400	There's a big problem.
3695400	3697400	You're heating it up at the same time.
3697400	3699400	What you're looking at now is the shift of EOS.
3699400	3703400	It's actually bound to your silicon nitride substrate.
3703400	3707400	That is, you're not a freestanding aluminum wire.
3707400	3712400	So it's hard to say how big it is.
3712400	3715400	Back to the question just now.
3715400	3719400	If you put this sample in a liquid nitrogen holder,
3719400	3722400	You can look at it after it's cooled down.
3722400	3724400	So you can also put it in a heating holder.
3724400	3725400	You can also heat it up.
3725400	3728400	So if you want to know the temperature range,
3728400	3730400	It's possible.
3730400	3731400	Yes.
3731400	3733400	Thank you.
3733400	3736400	I don't know much about this sample.
3736400	3738400	Because he's been here before.
3738400	3741400	So he was very polite.
3741400	3743400	That's what his structure is like.
3743400	3746400	Because all of our papers.
3746400	3747400	Science papers here.
3747400	3751400	We all thought he was a freestanding aluminum wire.
3751400	3754400	But what he said was that there was supporting underneath.
3754400	3760400	So you go and look at the slice in front of you.
3760400	3763400	The slice in front of you.
3763400	3765400	Why is the temperature change so big?
3765400	3767400	That's why it shifts so little.
3767400	3771400	You're not a freestanding sample.
3771400	3775400	You don't know how reliable this knife is.
3775400	3779400	And your error is 0.06 electron volt.
3779400	3782400	Your resolution is only 0.03.
3782400	3783400	Then you have two pixels.
3783400	3789400	I think this experiment is actually quite risky.
3789400	3793400	Because you don't know where the error comes from.
3793400	3797400	So basically, we think it's more reliable than three pixels.
3797400	3798400	I see.
3798400	3806400	Because this paper actually has a lot of citations.
3806400	3810400	There are a lot of people who do something later.
3810400	3813400	Or look at some things.
3813400	3816400	Because if you're a freestanding sample.
3816400	3818400	It makes a lot of sense if you measure it.
3818400	3820400	But you're supporting.
3820400	3821400	Like a sandwich.
3821400	3825400	If the heat expansion coefficient below is very poor.
3825400	3828400	It's very different from the temperature above.
3828400	3831400	Then you might have a similar effect.
3831400	3834400	Then you can't measure what the real thing should be like.
3834400	3835400	I see.
3835400	3836400	After we heard the speech that day.
3836400	3841400	Why do you have to wrap that layer underneath?
3841400	3845400	But I didn't really measure the temperature myself.
3845400	3850400	In my case, I always let the temperature be very warm.
3850400	3852400	If it's in this situation.
3852400	3854400	Then what I measured is.
3854400	3860400	The change in electron density comes from heat expansion.
3860400	3863400	Of course, this is also a new paper recently.
3863400	3866400	Then I'm also trying to see if I can.
3866400	3869400	I'm actually not very clear right now.
3869400	3872400	You are now.
3872400	3874400	You slice like this.
3874400	3876400	Sorry, until the next experiment.
3876400	3879400	You slice this.
3879400	3882400	Because of your.
3882400	3884400	You are because the temperature is different.
3884400	3886400	Then look at the energy of PLASMA is different.
3886400	3887400	You are now.
3887400	3889400	I let everything be PLASMA.
3889400	3891400	Everything.
3891400	3892400	This sample itself.
3892400	3894400	The temperature has become the same.
3894400	3896400	I went to see the interface.
3896400	3897400	With Bulk.
3897400	3899400	His.
3899400	3900400	The change in heat expansion.
3900400	3902400	But the two pictures below you.
3902400	3905400	Is there a temperature change?
3905400	3907400	This is the temperature here.
3907400	3909400	This is after you fix a temperature.
3909400	3911400	After reading it, change it to the next temperature.
3911400	3913400	Yes, this is a very tiring experiment.
3913400	3915400	But we've been trying it lately.
3915400	3917400	Because the first paper to do heat expansion.
3917400	3919400	Is in the secondary material.
3919400	3921400	Then we did it ourselves.
3921400	3923400	A ceramic traditional material.
3923400	3925400	Try it out.
3925400	3927400	Can they be used in traditional materials?
3927400	3929400	Above.
3929400	3931400	I can't tell you now.
3931400	3933400	Is it good or bad?
3933400	3935400	But I can tell you.
3935400	3937400	I really have two.
3937400	3939400	I understand.
3939400	3941400	I just said you were processing this data.
3941400	3943400	Have you ever done the so-called.
3943400	3945400	How to say.
3945400	3947400	Uh.
3947400	3949400	Consider your thickness.
3949400	3951400	Because thickness.
3951400	3953400	You speak very well.
3953400	3955400	Because.
3955400	3957400	Because in fact.
3957400	3959400	When you do this.
3959400	3961400	You can go to one by the way.
3961400	3963400	Anyway, the area you are in now.
3963400	3965400	You can do the thickness.
3965400	3967400	Maybe you are now.
3967400	3969400	After fitting.
3969400	3971400	After decoupling.
3971400	3973400	You can do the analysis later.
3973400	3975400	Then a point is.
3975400	3977400	I am in the thick area.
3977400	3979400	The heat expansion of the two areas is different.
3979400	3981400	I mean.
3981400	3983400	It doesn't matter if you are thick.
3983400	3985400	Because as long as you take a full score.
3985400	3987400	You can do decoupling.
3987400	3989400	After decoupling.
3989400	3991400	In fact, you are using decoupling data.
3991400	3993400	To do these.
3993400	3995400	Plasma energy fitting.
3995400	3997400	Maybe what you see.
3997400	3999400	It may be the same as now.
3999400	4001400	It should be said that all the data.
4001400	4003400	I have done it.
4003400	4005400	It's the backlight.
4007400	4009400	But my own data.
4009400	4011400	In the thick area and the thin area.
4011400	4013400	This.
4013400	4015400	The change in the heat expansion factor.
4015400	4017400	In fact, more should be related to quantum.
4017400	4019400	It's the same in the past.
4019400	4021400	Not necessarily.
4021400	4023400	If you are thin today.
4023400	4025400	The area is less than 40 nanometers.
4025400	4027400	The data you make now.
4027400	4029400	I don't know how thick it is.
4029400	4031400	But.
4031400	4033400	For you to do this experiment.
4033400	4035400	I would prefer to say.
4035400	4037400	You are probably 40 to 80 nanometers.
4037400	4039400	The thickness is the most perfect.
4039400	4041400	Because below 40 nanometers.
4041400	4043400	You will be more serious.
4043400	4045400	So all of you.
4045400	4047400	You think the peak of Bulk Plasma.
4047400	4049400	Will shift to low energy.
4049400	4051400	When you have high energy.
4051400	4053400	You are after multiple scattering.
4053400	4055400	You may.
4055400	4057400	You may have to do a lot of processing.
4057400	4059400	With your average thickness.
4059400	4061400	For example, 40 to 80 nanometers.
4061400	4063400	Maybe a little worse.
4063400	4065400	But not so much worse.
4065400	4067400	So I think you can consider.
4067400	4069400	You are now in these two areas.
4069400	4071400	What you marked.
4071400	4073400	Is the thickness.
4073400	4075400	In fact, you can calculate.
4075400	4077400	What is the thickness?
4077400	4079400	How many lambda?
4079400	4081400	I can tell you.
4081400	4083400	This is about 80 nanometers.
4083400	4085400	This is about 20 nanometers.
4085400	4087400	Because you have too many surface effects.
4087400	4089400	So the energy you are doing now.
4089400	4091400	You have to consider the surface plasma.
4091400	4093400	Not your own Bulk.
4093400	4095400	If you have a vacuum area.
4095400	4097400	If you have a vacuum area.
4097400	4099400	You just sweep past like this.
4099400	4101400	You can know your whole.
4101400	4103400	You want to identify.
4103400	4105400	Is the location of the Bulk Plasma shifted?
4105400	4107400	Then you know.
4107400	4109400	Your thinnest place.
4109400	4111400	The location of the energy you originally expected.
4111400	4113400	There is a deviation.
4113400	4115400	We can discuss this later.
4117400	4119400	Thank you very much for your comment.
4119400	4121400	I really don't know.
4121400	4123400	What you said above.
4123400	4125400	I don't really know.
4125400	4127400	What you just said.
4129400	4131400	Basically,
4131400	4133400	Valence.
4135400	4137400	I want to talk about this.
4137400	4139400	Finally, I want to add.
4139400	4141400	There is a new technology called Vibrational Yields.
4141400	4143400	That is also.
4143400	4145400	It was probably released in 2014.
4145400	4147400	It is a piece.
4147400	4149400	Its paper is.
4149400	4151400	Look at the optical phonon of boron nitride.
4151400	4153400	We ourselves.
4153400	4155400	In 2014.
4155400	4157400	Most of the time.
4157400	4159400	Look at the CH vibration of ionic liquid.
4159400	4161400	At that time, many people felt.
4161400	4163400	This is a mess.
4163400	4165400	But so.
4165400	4167400	We basically published it at the same time.
4167400	4169400	Then you can be sure.
4169400	4171400	The optical phonon of boron nitride.
4171400	4173400	You can see the phonon and the vibration.
4175400	4177400	A more popular method now.
4177400	4179400	It actually uses a model called.
4179400	4181400	You don't put the disease.
4181400	4183400	On top of your sample.
4183400	4185400	But outside the sample.
4185400	4187400	This mechanism.
4187400	4189400	It interprets.
4189400	4191400	It's all double scattering.
4191400	4193400	But they mean.
4193400	4195400	Your double scattering.
4195400	4197400	It's a signal.
4197400	4199400	The middle one.
4199400	4201400	It's more detailed.
4201400	4203400	Some people say it's virtual photon.
4203400	4205400	But this part.
4205400	4207400	I really don't understand.
4207400	4209400	What are they talking about?
4209400	4211400	But simply put.
4211400	4213400	You put the electron outside the sample.
4213400	4215400	In a specific position.
4215400	4217400	You can actually detect.
4217400	4219400	Your vibrational signal.
4219400	4221400	Through this matter.
4221400	4223400	In fact, since 2015.
4223400	4225400	Many people have been using this method.
4225400	4227400	To study some.
4227400	4229400	This should be biological.
4229400	4231400	Materials.
4231400	4233400	It can be.
4233400	4235400	Don't destroy your sample.
4235400	4237400	Detect outside.
4237400	4239400	Some of your material.
4239400	4241400	Vibrational mode.
4241400	4243400	If you are interested.
4243400	4245400	You can also look at some papers.
4245400	4247400	Or do this experiment.
4247400	4249400	In 2019.
4249400	4251400	I think it's more.
4251400	4253400	It may be a bit controversial.
4253400	4255400	Quite.
4255400	4257400	What people know is.
4257400	4259400	Carbon-12 and carbon-13.
4259400	4261400	That is, through EOS.
4261400	4263400	What I just said.
4263400	4265400	Since you can see.
4265400	4267400	If the molecules vibrate.
4267400	4269400	I believe.
4269400	4271400	Carbon-12 and oxygen bound.
4271400	4273400	Carbon-13 and oxygen bound.
4273400	4275400	Their vibrational mode.
4275400	4277400	In fact, it should be a bit different.
4277400	4279400	That's what Oak Ridge does.
4279400	4281400	You have carbon-12 particles.
4281400	4283400	To do EOS.
4283400	4285400	To distinguish these two.
4285400	4287400	Basically, they are using profile fitting.
4287400	4289400	To distinguish these two.
4289400	4291400	Because now.
4291400	4293400	The resolution at this time in 2019.
4293400	4295400	Neon's system is about.
4295400	4297400	5 mV.
4297400	4299400	So they can distinguish.
4299400	4301400	Carbon-13 and carbon-12.
4301400	4303400	If you are interested.
4303400	4305400	Oak Ridge has been doing this experiment.
4307400	4309400	I am.
4309400	4311400	I am actually.
4311400	4313400	Take it to study my glass.
4313400	4315400	Because in my glass.
4315400	4317400	There are two-handed oxygen and three-handed oxygen.
4317400	4319400	Two-handed oxygen and three-handed oxygen.
4319400	4321400	General XAS.
4321400	4323400	Or other.
4323400	4325400	In fact, it is difficult to see the difference.
4325400	4327400	My glass also has.
4327400	4329400	Silicon Ridge and Aluminum Ridge.
4329400	4331400	I can clearly know.
4331400	4333400	What kind of structure I see.
4333400	4335400	So I really go to study.
4335400	4337400	What is the difference.
4337400	4339400	What is the difference.
4339400	4341400	If you do profile fitting.
4341400	4343400	You will probably find it.
4343400	4345400	About 10 mV.
4345400	4347400	Then you can do some more analysis.
4347400	4349400	Tell you.
4349400	4351400	In the end, what you see.
4351400	4353400	Is it really from this oxygen coordination?
4353400	4355400	Change.
4355400	4357400	Or something from the hardware.
4357400	4359400	This is my own recent.
4359400	4361400	On Vibrational EOS.
4361400	4363400	Some research results.
4363400	4365400	If it is possible.
4365400	4367400	More people will be interested.
4367400	4369400	In fact.
4369400	4371400	Is this kind of Momentum Resolve.
4371400	4373400	Vibrational EOS.
4373400	4375400	In 2019.
4375400	4377400	Basically, some people started to study.
4377400	4379400	Since I can see the rope.
4379400	4381400	Then I also want to study.
4381400	4383400	This kind of phonon dispersion.
4383400	4385400	Is that you change the Q-vector.
4385400	4387400	You put your beam.
4387400	4389400	Like other.
4389400	4391400	Not directly on your.
4391400	4393400	Spectrometer.
4393400	4395400	If you give it a Q-vector.
4395400	4397400	Momentum transfer.
4397400	4399400	You can see.
4399400	4401400	This kind of phonon dispersion.
4401400	4403400	This picture is made in Japan.
4403400	4405400	To get this kind of experiment.
4405400	4407400	Suenaga.
4407400	4409400	They said they did it.
4409400	4411400	More than 60 hours.
4411400	4413400	But this year.
4413400	4415400	In 2020.
4415400	4417400	Two months ago.
4417400	4419400	Microsociety.
4419400	4421400	He studied.
4421400	4423400	Is that you are.
4423400	4425400	On the original spectrometer.
4425400	4427400	Add a layer.
4427400	4429400	You will get a lot at the same time.
4429400	4431400	Different Q-point.
4431400	4433400	EOS.
4433400	4435400	In 2019.
4435400	4437400	You have to do.
4437400	4439400	60 hours of such an experiment.
4439400	4441400	You use Neon's instrument.
4441400	4443400	With the latest method.
4443400	4445400	Can be done in 10 minutes.
4445400	4447400	If you are.
4447400	4449400	This kind of nanometer.
4449400	4451400	If you are interested.
4451400	4453400	You can check it out.
4453400	4455400	In the end.
4455400	4457400	It will become.
4457400	4459400	Electromagnetists.
4459400	4461400	Want to do atomic wave solution.
4461400	4463400	In 2020.
4463400	4465400	Recently.
4465400	4467400	He also did something like this.
4467400	4469400	Silicon on graphene.
4469400	4471400	He went to see.
4471400	4473400	His surrounding atoms.
4473400	4475400	Spectra of each atom.
4475400	4477400	Every one.
4477400	4479400	Of course it is a very difficult experiment.
4479400	4481400	But they are also using.
4481400	4483400	Very high Q-vector.
4483400	4485400	To see this kind of spectra.
4485400	4487400	So you can make sure.
4487400	4489400	Detected signals.
4489400	4491400	All come from a single atom.
4491400	4493400	I'm not sure.
4493400	4495400	How simple is this experiment.
4495400	4497400	How complicated.
4497400	4499400	Or where is its accuracy.
4499400	4501400	But this is the current field.
4501400	4503400	The latest research results.
4503400	4505400	If you are interested.
4505400	4507400	In the end.
4507400	4509400	The information you really want to bring home.
4509400	4511400	In fact.
4511400	4513400	Electromagnetism is not just a magnifying glass.
4513400	4515400	Although many people think so.
4515400	4517400	Modern STEM fields.
4517400	4519400	Is a very powerful tool.
4519400	4521400	If you want to do.
4521400	4523400	The experiments I just mentioned.
4523400	4525400	You can choose some open facilities.
4525400	4527400	Like Oak Ridge.
4527400	4529400	Molecular foundry.
4529400	4531400	Berkeley.
4531400	4533400	ERC in Germany.
4533400	4535400	STEM in the UK.
4535400	4537400	Nanotechnology platform in Japan.
4537400	4539400	You can apply for some.
4539400	4541400	You can write your proposal.
4541400	4543400	To apply for time.
4543400	4545400	Then do such an experiment.
4545400	4547400	The above is probably.
4547400	4549400	Today's content.
4549400	4551400	If I am also in.
4551400	4553400	I want to do more glass recently.
4553400	4555400	Then there are some.
4555400	4557400	Is the MOF glass.
4557400	4559400	Or the glass on the secondary material.
4559400	4561400	If there is such a similar sample.
4561400	4563400	Thank you.
4563400	4565400	Thank you for the speech.
4565400	4567400	Very complete.
4567400	4569400	Let's applaud first.
4569400	4571400	Thank you for his speech.
4575400	4577400	Then.
4577400	4579400	Let's go straight to the question.
4579400	4581400	Because the time seems to have passed.
4581400	4583400	Sorry.
4583400	4585400	It doesn't matter.
4587400	4589400	To add.
4589400	4591400	This is a thing called paradigm.
4591400	4593400	Also throw proposal.
4593400	4595400	Then we can do the experiment for you.
4595400	4597400	Cornell.
4597400	4599400	You mean.
4599400	4601400	You can also do this.
4601400	4603400	Yes.
4603400	4605400	Thank you.
4605400	4607400	Yes.
4607400	4609400	If.
4609400	4611400	Finally, to add.
4611400	4613400	If you are very interested in 4D STEM.
4613400	4615400	Like I just said.
4615400	4617400	Or Berkeley.
4617400	4619400	Then if you are.
4619400	4621400	EOS.
4621400	4623400	If you are very interested.
4623400	4625400	Ocarina and Super STEM.
4625400	4627400	At present.
4627400	4629400	Basically the best in the world.
4629400	4631400	Everyone can.
4631400	4633400	Take it as a priority.
4643400	4645400	If everyone has no questions.
4645400	4647400	I actually have a question.
4647400	4649400	Sorry, you ask first.
4649400	4651400	OK.
4651400	4653400	This EOS.
4653400	4655400	Can you measure acetone?
4655400	4657400	Because the general RPEC.
4657400	4659400	The reason is because it can only measure single particles.
4659400	4661400	But EOS looks like.
4661400	4663400	Should be able to measure.
4663400	4665400	Because it looks like.
4665400	4667400	And it should be.
4667400	4669400	Can also measure.
4669400	4671400	Then.
4671400	4673400	I have seen someone.
4673400	4675400	Measure.
4675400	4677400	If it is vibrational.
4677400	4679400	Someone is measuring.
4679400	4681400	Then.
4681400	4683400	This paper.
4683400	4685400	It actually mentions a little.
4685400	4687400	Acetone effect.
4687400	4689400	But I'm not sure.
4689400	4691400	Does it have anything to do with what you said?
4691400	4693400	Because I am in this field.
4693400	4695400	I know nothing about acetone.
4695400	4697400	But there is also a strange question here.
4697400	4699400	Why does it have a selection rule?
4699400	4701400	I just can't figure it out.
4701400	4703400	Electron loss.
4703400	4705400	Is there any special selection rule?
4705400	4707400	You can think of it as.
4707400	4709400	Its mechanism.
4709400	4711400	General EOS.
4711400	4713400	It is still dipole scattering.
4713400	4715400	It is basically.
4715400	4717400	There is no resonant.
4717400	4719400	So it follows the selection rule.
4719400	4721400	That is Fermi golden rule.
4723400	4725400	If it is Fermi.
4725400	4727400	If it is simply Fermi golden rule.
4727400	4729400	You mean.
4729400	4731400	Is it like the Fermi golden rule of light and snow?
4731400	4733400	Yes.
4733400	4735400	It is.
4735400	4737400	Fermi golden rule of light and snow.
4737400	4739400	Then.
4739400	4741400	That is.
4741400	4743400	According to your.
4743400	4745400	Angle.
4745400	4747400	It is the focus angle.
4747400	4749400	And the absorption angle is different.
4749400	4751400	You will see your.
4751400	4753400	EOS signal will be different.
4753400	4755400	But.
4755400	4757400	If it is light and snow.
4757400	4759400	It should be optical phonon.
4759400	4761400	It can be absorbed.
4761400	4763400	Wait a minute.
4763400	4765400	I confirm.
4765400	4767400	Optical phonon is possible.
4767400	4769400	It is IR active.
4769400	4771400	Yes.
4771400	4773400	But.
4773400	4775400	I am looking at the paper.
4775400	4777400	What I see now.
4777400	4779400	The situation is.
4779400	4781400	The first.
4781400	4783400	You.
4783400	4785400	That is.
4785400	4787400	Its selection rule.
4787400	4789400	It is still more like IR.
4789400	4791400	We all say it is.
4791400	4793400	IR optical phonon under the magnitude of nanometer.
4793400	4795400	But if you put your Q vector.
4795400	4797400	Move to a very high Q.
4797400	4799400	Then greater than your.
4799400	4801400	The first non-dimensional area.
4801400	4803400	At present.
4803400	4805400	Everyone's statement is that you are like this.
4805400	4807400	You can see some.
4807400	4809400	The selection rule that you could not see.
4809400	4811400	Yes.
4811400	4813400	But.
4813400	4815400	The physical content should be.
4815400	4817400	The current formula is already there.
4817400	4819400	But I have to go.
4819400	4821400	Try to understand the formula.
4821400	4823400	Yes.
4823400	4825400	Can I interrupt?
4825400	4827400	Yes.
4827400	4829400	You see this picture.
4829400	4831400	You think of it as the simplest.
4831400	4833400	If you put that to L.
4833400	4835400	It is called Gamma as a starting point.
4835400	4837400	Gamma to N.
4837400	4839400	In the crystal structure.
4839400	4841400	Facing the machine.
4841400	4843400	You have a different one.
4843400	4845400	Can run out.
4845400	4847400	This will form you.
4847400	4849400	Your so-called selection rule.
4849400	4851400	Come out.
4853400	4855400	Do you understand what I mean?
4855400	4857400	So this picture.
4857400	4859400	I saw this picture.
4859400	4861400	The first impression is that it is very strange.
4861400	4863400	All gray lines are theoretical calculations.
4863400	4865400	All red lines are experimental data.
4865400	4867400	Theoretical calculation.
4867400	4869400	Gamma to N.
4869400	4871400	Gamma to N.
4871400	4873400	Is symmetrical.
4873400	4875400	But it is not symmetrical in practice.
4875400	4877400	Oh, OK.
4877400	4879400	So this is when I saw this picture.
4879400	4881400	The first thing I feel is.
4881400	4883400	The area of ​​Plasma.
4883400	4885400	Is symmetrical.
4885400	4887400	But this one.
4887400	4889400	Is not symmetrical.
4889400	4891400	I do not know at the moment.
4891400	4893400	What special things happen.
4893400	4895400	The first one.
4895400	4897400	This picture.
4897400	4899400	As far as I know.
4899400	4901400	Is done for more than 60 hours.
4901400	4903400	Experimental error.
4903400	4905400	Must be considered.
4905400	4907400	I mean.
4907400	4909400	In fact, we are doing.
4909400	4911400	Momentum Resolution.
4911400	4913400	Gamma to N.
4913400	4915400	Gamma to N.
4915400	4917400	Gamma to N.
4917400	4919400	This picture is very simple.
4919400	4921400	It should be symmetrical.
4921400	4923400	Phonon is difficult to do.
4923400	4925400	This energy is very low.
4925400	4927400	So it takes a long time to collect.
4927400	4929400	But.
4929400	4931400	I think no matter how long you are.
4931400	4933400	You will calculate.
4933400	4935400	The position of the real loss peak.
4935400	4937400	It must be.
4937400	4939400	From one point to another.
4939400	4941400	Slowly collect the data.
4941400	4943400	Piled up.
4943400	4945400	This is what I feel.
4945400	4947400	I can not understand from the beginning.
4947400	4949400	This picture is supposed to be.
4949400	4951400	textbook.
4951400	4953400	Or something else.
4953400	4955400	This energy should be symmetrical.
4955400	4957400	But your experiment is not symmetrical.
4957400	4959400	That's what I do not understand.
4963400	4965400	I can ask.
4965400	4967400	Goodman is.
4967400	4969400	Please say.
4969400	4971400	Your name and organization.
4971400	4973400	Which one is it?
4973400	4975400	My last name is Liu.
4975400	4977400	Liu Bei Liu.
4977400	4979400	Thought is humble.
4979400	4981400	Where are you now?
4981400	4983400	I am in the United States.
4983400	4985400	Maryland University.
4987400	4989400	Also specializing in EOS.
4989400	4991400	I am in Taiwan.
4991400	4993400	EOS.
4993400	4995400	I'm just a service here.
4995400	4997400	Taiwan is EOS.
4997400	4999400	Is a famous teacher.
4999400	5001400	I used to be in that group.
5001400	5003400	I understand.
5003400	5005400	What you just said.
5005400	5007400	In 1970.
5007400	5009400	You just mentioned.
5009400	5011400	David Muller.
5011400	5013400	David Muller is my teacher.
5015400	5017400	John Sircus.
5019400	5021400	I know.
5021400	5023400	The first.
5023400	5025400	I was in Taiwan University.
5025400	5027400	Postal boss.
5027400	5029400	He is the first doctor.
5029400	5031400	So you hear now.
5031400	5033400	The most famous should be David Muller.
5033400	5035400	David Muller is a countdown.
5035400	5037400	Before the lab shut down.
5037400	5039400	Doctor.
5039400	5041400	But David Muller.
5041400	5043400	He did not do EOS recently.
5043400	5045400	You have one in front.
5045400	5047400	Silicone dumbbell.
5047400	5049400	That's called Fee Bateson.
5049400	5051400	I know.
5051400	5053400	The second doctor.
5053400	5055400	That's it.
5055400	5057400	You are familiar with Fee Bateson.
5057400	5059400	Because Fee Bateson used to do.
5059400	5061400	Q-dependent EOS.
5061400	5063400	But not vibration.
5063400	5065400	Yes.
5065400	5067400	I am.
5067400	5069400	Because our group does not have a device.
5069400	5071400	I can only use.
5071400	5073400	I can't.
5073400	5075400	Do such a thing.
5075400	5077400	This is actually.
5077400	5079400	Because Fonon has been doing it for a long time.
5079400	5081400	So this is not expected.
5081400	5083400	Because if you say Plasma.
5083400	5085400	About five seconds to solve.
5085400	5087400	You mean like.
5087400	5089400	You just this picture.
5089400	5091400	Your last picture.
5091400	5093400	This is not.
5093400	5095400	It is scanned with Scanning TM.
5095400	5097400	So.
5097400	5099400	Your whole spectrum.
5099400	5101400	What are you talking about?
5101400	5103400	How long do you scan the spectrum image?
5103400	5105400	How long will it end?
5105400	5107400	It just needs to do some.
5107400	5109400	This.
5109400	5111400	Processing.
5111400	5113400	But before.
5113400	5115400	In the John Sialkas group.
5115400	5117400	What they do is Q-dependent EOS.
5117400	5119400	This one came out.
5119400	5121400	No need to do.
5121400	5123400	At most because it used to be a photo.
5123400	5125400	So at most just do.
5125400	5127400	Data to identify.
5127400	5129400	But it's just a picture.
5129400	5131400	It's the picture you see now.
5131400	5133400	It is a.
5133400	5135400	It used to be a photo.
5135400	5137400	But because there is no.
5137400	5139400	How to say.
5139400	5141400	After you take a picture.
5141400	5143400	You have to put the skill bar on it.
5143400	5145400	Calculate energy.
5145400	5147400	So the role of Fee Patterson is.
5147400	5149400	The digital computer.
5149400	5151400	To put the coordinates.
5151400	5153400	The number of coordinates.
5153400	5155400	Then my teacher is.
5155400	5157400	My teacher is a watch.
5157400	5159400	He is a computer watch.
5159400	5161400	So it is.
5165400	5167400	But I think the future.
5167400	5169400	Momentum Resolve.
5169400	5171400	This year.
5171400	5173400	After he used a slide.
5173400	5175400	I think that way.
5175400	5177400	Copy the most primitive way.
5177400	5179400	He put a slide on it.
5179400	5181400	You can do it.
5181400	5183400	You can get it in 10 minutes.
5183400	5185400	You can get it in a minute.
5185400	5187400	His slide is.
5187400	5189400	The earliest David Muller.
5189400	5191400	The device they use.
5193400	5195400	That's right.
5195400	5197400	You just change your EOS.
5197400	5199400	Yes.
5199400	5201400	But this is.
5201400	5203400	You can do it on EOS.
5203400	5205400	You can do it on EOS.
5205400	5207400	But we can't do it ourselves.
5207400	5209400	You can change it on EOS.
5209400	5211400	Or you.
5211400	5213400	In your.
5213400	5215400	You usually have a screen now.
5215400	5217400	You can change it on your screen.
5217400	5219400	You can change it on your screen.
5219400	5221400	Anyway, you just use a slide.
5221400	5223400	That's it.
5223400	5225400	That's it.
5225400	5227400	It's not hard.
5227400	5229400	It's not hard.
5229400	5231400	We used to change it.
5231400	5233400	If you want to cooperate.
5233400	5235400	If you want to cooperate.
5235400	5237400	I think it's not difficult in Asia.
5237400	5239400	I think it's not difficult in Asia.
5239400	5241400	It's harder in America.
5241400	5243400	Because you have to call the manufacturers.
5243400	5245400	Because you have to call the manufacturers.
5245400	5247400	That's right.
5247400	5249400	It's hard for us.
5249400	5251400	It's hard for us.
5251400	5253400	So you guys.
5253400	5255400	The whole experience of the University of Tokyo.
5255400	5257400	The whole experience of the University of Tokyo.
5257400	5259400	A lot of.
5259400	5261400	That's what the lab does.
5261400	5263400	Is that what it means?
5263400	5265400	About a dozen, at the moment.
5265400	5267400	About a dozen, at the moment.
5267400	5269400	More than 10 is open to the public.
5269400	5271400	That is the nanotechnology platform I mentioned at the end.
5271400	5273400	The nanotechnology platform I mentioned at the end.
5273400	5275400	But there's a part of the teahouse.
5275400	5277400	I just said a lot.
5277400	5279400	a lot of developers.
5279400	5281400	A lot of developers.
5281400	5283400	It's their lab.
5283400	5285400	It's their lab.
5285400	5287400	So I want to ask you.
5287400	5289400	So I want to ask you.
5289400	5291400	You just mentioned 4D.
5291400	5293400	Especially the part of the power plant.
5293400	5295400	You still have to use it now.
5295400	5297400	What I know is.
5297400	5299400	There is no commercial software.
5299400	5301400	Let's just do it.
5301400	5303400	You still have to have some of your own.
5303400	5305400	Now.
5305400	5307400	This kind of DPC.
5307400	5309400	No, no, no.
5309400	5311400	You're the one on the right.
5311400	5313400	You're the one on the left.
5313400	5315400	I'm on the right.
5315400	5317400	You're on the right.
5317400	5319400	This is what we do.
5319400	5321400	This is what we do.
5321400	5323400	They're doing this.
5323400	5325400	So they write the code themselves.
5325400	5327400	But now.
5327400	5329400	I'm going to this year.
5329400	5331400	If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.
5331400	5333400	If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.
5333400	5335400	If you go to SEMO Fisher Japan in July.
5335400	5337400	The latest SEMO Fisher.
5337400	5339400	The latest SEMO Fisher.
5339400	5341400	You can do DPC.
5341400	5343400	Because I thought.
5343400	5345400	We still have to use Python.
5345400	5347400	We still have to use Python.
5347400	5349400	If you look at it now.
5349400	5351400	You can think of it.
5351400	5353400	The one I went to see with the teacher.
5353400	5355400	It's not even Titan's DPC.
5355400	5357400	It's not even Titan's DPC.
5357400	5359400	Python code.
5359400	5361400	Python code.
5361400	5363400	There are a lot of commercial software.
5363400	5365400	There are a lot of commercial software.
5365400	5367400	Because of our biggest gold.
5367400	5369400	Because of our biggest gold.
5369400	5371400	And there's a bear.
5371400	5373400	And there's a bear.
5373400	5375400	He has been addicted recently.
5375400	5377400	He has been addicted recently.
5377400	5379400	Because it's the first time he developed it.
5379400	5381400	Because it's the first time he developed it.
5381400	5383400	But I.
5383400	5385400	But I.
5385400	5387400	The thing that's below you.
5387400	5389400	The thing that's below you.
5389400	5391400	The next one I remember one day.
5391400	5393400	Just this one.
5393400	5395400	The first page.
5395400	5397400	The first page.
5397400	5399400	This thing.
5399400	5401400	No, it's on the next page.
5401400	5403400	Sorry.
5403400	5405400	So that's it.
5405400	5407400	Right.
5407400	5409400	This thing was first
5409400	5411400	made by a Japanese
5411400	5413400	named Nims.
5413400	5415400	A Japanese named Nims made it.
5415400	5417400	Ah, Nims.
5417400	5419400	I go there often.
5419400	5421400	What's it called? Kimoto.
5421400	5423400	Koji Kimoto.
5423400	5425400	And.
5425400	5427400	I thought it was commercialized.
5427400	5429400	But in fact, they said they didn't.
5429400	5431400	They only
5431400	5433400	finished the 4D
5433400	5435400	process.
5435400	5437400	But later,
5437400	5439400	at that time,
5439400	5441400	in 2011,
5441400	5443400	they did it manually.
5443400	5445400	But now
5445400	5447400	you don't see such a good result.
5447400	5449400	Yes.
5449400	5451400	Most of the 4D
5451400	5453400	that are made now are made in Europe and America.
5453400	5455400	I can assure you that
5455400	5457400	there are very few people
5457400	5459400	who do this in Japan at this stage.
5459400	5461400	Very few.
5461400	5463400	But I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.
5463400	5465400	I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.
5465400	5467400	I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.
5467400	5469400	I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.
5469400	5471400	I know Kimoto was the first one to do it.
5471400	5473400	I will go to Kimoto's factory
5473400	5475400	to do the experiment next week.
5475400	5477400	Because this thing.
5477400	5479400	Sorry.
5479400	5481400	We are talking too professionally.
5481400	5483400	To put it simply,
5483400	5485400	when every muscle
5485400	5487400	has an order
5487400	5489400	and a specific direction,
5489400	5491400	in Kimoto's theory,
5491400	5493400	I know this muscle,
5493400	5495400	I know its muscle structure.
5495400	5497400	In terms of muscle structure,
5497400	5499400	you have the so-called symmetry.
5499400	5501400	The most important thing about Kimoto
5501400	5503400	is that he talked about
5503400	5505400	the symmetry of the Atomic Scale,
5505400	5507400	not the
5507400	5509400	symmetry of a large muscle.
5509400	5511400	He used the
5511400	5513400	rightmost picture
5513400	5515400	called the most typical
5515400	5517400	Pythagorean Theorem.
5517400	5519400	He can make
5519400	5521400	the so-called
5521400	5523400	4D
5523400	5525400	figure of the
5525400	5527400	Pythagorean Theorem.
5527400	5529400	After the 4D figure
5529400	5531400	comes out,
5531400	5533400	based on the
5533400	5535400	inner ring and outer ring,
5535400	5537400	you can know the symmetry
5537400	5539400	of the muscle structure.
5539400	5541400	More importantly,
5541400	5543400	in addition to proving this,
5543400	5545400	Kimoto also talked about
5545400	5547400	why in electromagnetic microscope,
5547400	5549400	especially in scanning TM,
5549400	5551400	the loss of the atomic scale is larger,
5551400	5553400	the loss of the atomic state is second,
5553400	5555400	and the loss of the oxygen is the last.
5555400	5557400	In his diffraction pattern,
5557400	5559400	he told you
5559400	5561400	why the image I see now
5561400	5563400	has such a big intensity change
5563400	5565400	when I circle
5565400	5567400	it.
5567400	5569400	So in fact,
5569400	5571400	I read that paper for a long time,
5571400	5573400	and I found that
5573400	5575400	I thought there was a commercial software
5575400	5577400	that could do the
5577400	5579400	post-processing,
5579400	5581400	but there was no
5581400	5583400	post-processing after
5583400	5585400	the commercial software
5585400	5587400	did the 4D.
5587400	5589400	I think the biggest problem
5589400	5591400	now is that,
5591400	5593400	as you just said,
5593400	5595400	Kimoto himself wrote.
5595400	5597400	Yes, because the first time I heard this
5597400	5599400	was also in UC Irvine.
5599400	5601400	They have a group
5601400	5603400	doing this.
5603400	5605400	Then when they talked about it,
5605400	5607400	I realized that
5607400	5609400	in the past,
5609400	5611400	they might have
5611400	5613400	read Kimoto's paper
5613400	5615400	as reading,
5615400	5617400	but they didn't mention it,
5617400	5619400	because the concept was the same.
5619400	5621400	It used to be called Scanning CBET.
5621400	5623400	No, the word Kimoto used
5623400	5625400	was more fancy,
5625400	5627400	called Atomic Scale Symmetry.
5631400	5633400	Oh, I see.
5633400	5635400	Yes, it's Atomic Scale Symmetry.
5635400	5637400	Because if you really do
5637400	5639400	the calculation of CBET,
5639400	5641400	the CBET pattern
5641400	5643400	made by these three elements
5643400	5645400	is really different.
5645400	5647400	We seem to be talking too professionally.
5647400	5649400	Can I ask you a question?
5649400	5651400	Sure.
5651400	5653400	Sorry.
5653400	5655400	Do you have any questions?
5655400	5657400	If you have any questions
5657400	5659400	about CBET,
5659400	5661400	you can ask.
5663400	5665400	Hello.
5665400	5667400	Can you hear me?
5667400	5669400	Yes, I can.
5669400	5671400	I want to add
5671400	5673400	that UC Irvine
5673400	5675400	also has
5675400	5677400	user facilities
5677400	5679400	for training
5679400	5681400	and samples.
5681400	5683400	They also have staff
5683400	5685400	to do experiments.
5685400	5687400	Our group often
5687400	5689400	goes to UC Irvine to do TEM.
5689400	5691400	I have a question about
5691400	5693400	when we were doing
5693400	5695400	some low-melt point
5695400	5697400	metal TEM,
5697400	5699400	we were doing
5699400	5701400	cryo TEM,
5701400	5703400	but when we were
5703400	5705400	using cryo holder,
5705400	5707400	we couldn't get
5707400	5709400	a very good resolution
5709400	5711400	when we were doing
5711400	5713400	stem HEDF
5713400	5715400	mapping.
5715400	5717400	I want to know
5717400	5719400	if there are
5719400	5721400	other ways
5721400	5723400	to do
5723400	5725400	low-melting materials
5725400	5727400	to get
5727400	5729400	a better
5729400	5731400	Z-contrast
5731400	5733400	or other
5733400	5735400	resolutions.
5735400	5737400	Thank you for your question.
5737400	5739400	My understanding is
5739400	5741400	that you can't get
5741400	5743400	a very good resolution
5743400	5745400	when you are doing cryo
5745400	5747400	because your liquid nitrogen
5747400	5749400	actually flows.
5749400	5751400	You have
5751400	5753400	touched liquid nitrogen
5753400	5755400	or liquid nitrogen gas,
5755400	5757400	and you know
5757400	5759400	that it actually flows.
5759400	5761400	I think this is
5761400	5763400	a big reason
5763400	5765400	why you can't get
5765400	5767400	a stable Z-contrast.
5767400	5769400	You just mentioned
5769400	5771400	if there are
5771400	5773400	other ways to
5773400	5775400	change this or get
5775400	5777400	a better resolution.
5777400	5779400	I haven't done
5779400	5781400	anything like this,
5781400	5783400	but what I want to mention
5783400	5785400	is that
5785400	5787400	for example,
5787400	5789400	when you look at
5789400	5791400	high-resolution images,
5791400	5793400	you can't get
5793400	5795400	a very good image
5795400	5797400	because your strength
5797400	5799400	is too weak.
5799400	5801400	David Miller Group
5801400	5803400	used a method
5803400	5805400	called TychoGraphy
5805400	5807400	in 2018,
5807400	5809400	which is 4D stem.
5809400	5811400	They used this method
5811400	5813400	to get a more blurry
5813400	5815400	graphic image
5815400	5817400	with higher resolution
5817400	5819400	and higher resolution.
5819400	5821400	That paper is also
5821400	5823400	a very famous paper
5823400	5825400	by Nature.
5825400	5827400	If you have any
5827400	5829400	information about
5829400	5831400	David Miller Group,
5831400	5833400	you can add it.
5833400	5835400	But as far as I know,
5835400	5837400	it is very suitable for
5837400	5839400	people who can't get
5839400	5841400	a high resolution image.
5841400	5843400	This 4D stem can help you.
5843400	5845400	I think that's it.
5845400	5847400	I guess
5847400	5849400	Cryo's problem is that
5849400	5851400	your sample stage
5851400	5853400	moves too fast,
5853400	5855400	so you can't get a good image.
5855400	5857400	There are several ways
5857400	5859400	about this.
5859400	5861400	One way is to scan very fast
5861400	5863400	and scan a lot of pages.
5863400	5865400	Then you fold it up
5865400	5867400	in a post-processing way
5867400	5869400	to get a good image.
5869400	5871400	This method was developed
5871400	5873400	by Lena Kakoudis
5873400	5875400	Cryo Stem.
5879400	5881400	We can try it.
5881400	5883400	Thank you.
5885400	5887400	I have a question.
5889400	5891400	Before I talk about this question,
5891400	5893400	I have a small comment.
5893400	5895400	Because I am
5895400	5897400	the speaker today,
5897400	5899400	Project Hera.
5899400	5901400	We are staff.
5901400	5903400	I strongly recommend
5903400	5905400	you to keep in touch.
5905400	5907400	If you can keep in touch
5907400	5909400	and help each other,
5909400	5911400	it is the biggest reward for us.
5911400	5913400	You feel the same, right?
5913400	5915400	Yes.
5915400	5917400	This is a small comment.
5917400	5919400	I suggest you
5919400	5921400	to keep in touch.
5921400	5923400	If you think Project Hera
5923400	5925400	is helpful to you,
5925400	5927400	you can recommend it to others.
5927400	5929400	My question is this.
5929400	5931400	This is a crazy idea.
5931400	5933400	If I have a sample today,
5933400	5935400	what if I put it down
5935400	5937400	for five years?
5937400	5939400	Keep taking pictures.
5939400	5941400	What is the resolution
5941400	5943400	you want to achieve?
5943400	5945400	A sample
5945400	5947400	can be placed
5947400	5949400	in the middle of your screen.
5949400	5951400	Actually,
5951400	5953400	I want to measure
5953400	5955400	the distance between
5955400	5957400	all the atoms.
5957400	5959400	But I am waiting
5959400	5961400	for something to happen.
5961400	5963400	Why do I want to monitor?
5963400	5965400	Because what I expect
5965400	5967400	is not static.
5967400	5969400	The distribution of the atom
5969400	5971400	is like this,
5971400	5973400	but suddenly it moves.
5973400	5975400	Why did I
5975400	5977400	take a picture of you
5977400	5979400	for a long time?
5979400	5981400	Because I think
5981400	5983400	what I expect
5983400	5985400	is the time scale
5985400	5987400	from 10s to 100s microseconds.
5987400	5989400	So if you take a picture
5989400	5991400	for two seconds,
5991400	5993400	you will miss it easily.
5993400	5995400	I just said
5995400	5997400	taking a picture for two seconds
5997400	5999400	means a lot of pixels.
5999400	6001400	One pixel is
6001400	6003400	about 20 microseconds,
6003400	6005400	which I often use.
6005400	6007400	But maybe
6007400	6009400	I still can't catch
6009400	6011400	what you want.
6011400	6013400	Another big problem
6013400	6015400	is that I'm not sure
6015400	6017400	how much electron radiation
6017400	6019400	your sample can withstand.
6019400	6021400	Because this is
6021400	6023400	a key problem
6023400	6025400	for TEM.
6025400	6027400	If your sample can withstand
6027400	6029400	infinite electron radiation,
6029400	6031400	of course you can do
6031400	6033400	similar experiments.
6033400	6035400	But if your sample can only withstand
6035400	6037400	one minute,
6037400	6039400	you will have damage,
6039400	6041400	or you have some carbon damage,
6041400	6043400	or you can even
6043400	6045400	pierce your sample.
6045400	6047400	Then you won't be able to do such experiments.
6049400	6051400	I think
6051400	6053400	I will think
6053400	6055400	from this perspective.
6055400	6057400	Actually,
6057400	6059400	this is what I think.
6059400	6061400	Radiation damage.
6061400	6063400	We are used to discussing
6063400	6065400	what is an electron,
6065400	6067400	one, two, three.
6067400	6069400	We rarely discuss
6069400	6071400	what is an electron.
6071400	6073400	But basically,
6073400	6075400	this is what happens in electrons.
6075400	6077400	Yes.
6077400	6079400	Actually, there is such a lab.
6079400	6081400	In Sandia National Lab,
6081400	6083400	they have connected
6083400	6085400	a particle beam
6085400	6087400	to hit your sample,
6087400	6089400	to look at your
6089400	6091400	radiation damage.
6093400	6095400	There is such a thing.
6095400	6097400	Time resolution can barely reach millisecond.
6097400	6099400	There are
6099400	6101400	faster detectors,
6101400	6103400	about 400 frames per second,
6103400	6105400	or 2000 frames per second.
6105400	6107400	It can barely reach
6107400	6109400	millisecond.
6111400	6113400	Okay, let me ask.
6113400	6115400	We are actually doing
6115400	6117400	carbon-based
6117400	6119400	spectroscopy detector
6119400	6121400	in Sandia.
6121400	6123400	Okay, thank you.
6123400	6125400	They mainly look at
6125400	6127400	radiation.
6127400	6129400	I can comment on
6129400	6131400	the microscope in Sandia.
6131400	6133400	If they use
6133400	6135400	photoelectron,
6135400	6137400	they can make the electron pulse to nanosecond.
6137400	6139400	So if your sample
6139400	6141400	is beautiful enough,
6141400	6143400	although it does not show
6143400	6145400	a sample like a sample,
6145400	6147400	but if it sounds
6147400	6149400	like a millisecond,
6149400	6151400	for example,
6151400	6153400	if you want to do it in a shorter time,
6153400	6155400	you can do it.
6161400	6163400	I want to ask a question.
6163400	6165400	You just mentioned
6165400	6167400	that it can measure electric field
6167400	6169400	and magnetic field.
6169400	6171400	How good is the sensitivity?
6173400	6175400	I can tell you that
6175400	6177400	they all say
6177400	6179400	atomic resolution,
6179400	6181400	but I'm not sure
6181400	6183400	how good it is.
6187400	6189400	I don't know if you've heard of
6189400	6191400	something called
6191400	6193400	SCAMEL.
6195400	6197400	Some people use
6197400	6199400	such a device to measure
6199400	6201400	SCAMEL.
6201400	6203400	If you want to go to
6203400	6205400	atomic resolution,
6205400	6207400	that is,
6207400	6209400	for example,
6209400	6211400	I think
6211400	6213400	this TEM
6213400	6215400	considers
6215400	6217400	whether the magnetic field
6217400	6219400	penetrates your sample.
6219400	6221400	This is a key question.
6221400	6223400	If you use
6223400	6225400	something without any magnetic field penetration,
6225400	6227400	you can really determine
6227400	6229400	if your magnetic field
6229400	6231400	really comes from a very local area.
6231400	6233400	But if you always have
6233400	6235400	a general TEM,
6235400	6237400	that is, there is a magnetic field
6237400	6239400	that penetrates your sample,
6239400	6241400	I'm not sure
6241400	6243400	how good your resolution is.
6243400	6245400	Sorry, my question is
6245400	6247400	that you may have misunderstood my question.
6247400	6249400	My question is not about
6249400	6251400	how good the spatial resolution is.
6251400	6253400	My question is,
6253400	6255400	for example,
6255400	6257400	what is the magnetic field
6257400	6259400	or magnetic field
6259400	6261400	that can be measured
6261400	6263400	at a micrometer level?
6263400	6265400	I'm sorry,
6265400	6267400	I don't know how much this number is.
6267400	6269400	Because what we currently see
6269400	6271400	is that its principle
6271400	6273400	is to look at your electron,
6273400	6275400	at least the principle of DPC
6275400	6277400	is to see how much your electron beam
6277400	6279400	deviates.
6279400	6281400	You can know its direction
6281400	6283400	and its strength
6283400	6285400	by doing this.
6285400	6287400	You get something like this,
6287400	6289400	for example,
6289400	6291400	a map of the direction
6291400	6293400	from the center.
6293400	6295400	To be honest,
6295400	6297400	I'm not sure
6297400	6299400	how strong it is.
6299400	6301400	OK, I can go back and look at these questions.
6301400	6303400	Thank you.
6303400	6305400	Thank you.
6307400	6309400	OK,
6309400	6311400	if there are no other questions,
6311400	6313400	I will end the recording
6313400	6315400	here.
