408000	413000	which aims to measured dark matter.
413000	418000	What I mean is there are 30 spectrums in this list
418000	423000	There is a difference between the expected and predicted mass by GRAVITY
423000	426000	There is a difference between the expected and predicted mass by GRAVITY
426000	429380	When it is
429380	434380	close to about the galaxy,
434380	437380	the material is able to spin faster than the prescribed velocity
437380	440380	when it is close to about the galaxy,
440380	443380	the material is able to spin faster than the prescribed velocity
443380	446580	This means when it
446580	449580	is close to the galaxy, the force is much greater than the expected force
449580	452580	when it is close to the galaxy, the force is much greater than the expected force
452580	455580	It is able to maintain the orbit faster
455580	458580	It is able to maintain the orbit faster
458580	461580	If you have any questions, just ask directly
461580	464580	Sometimes, there are some confusion
464580	467580	Is this uncertainty too blue?
467580	470580	Is this uncertainty too blue?
470580	473580	It looks like the blue line is very strong
473580	476580	The blue line indicates that it should look like this
476580	479580	The blue line indicates that it should look like this
479580	482580	The blue line indicates that it should look like this
482580	485580	And the red line indicates that it probably grows like this
485580	488580	But it says that the measurement allows to accurately measure if any location
488580	491580	But it says that the measurement allows to accurately measure if any location
491580	494580	can measure the distance between the crucible, solar system's velocity
494580	497580	can measure the distance between the crucible, solar system's velocity
497580	500580	each média indicates very low uncertainty
500580	503580	each média indicates very low uncertainty
503580	506580	each média indicates very low uncertainty
506580	509580	Okay, so this should be very accurate
509580	512580	Okay, so this should be very accurate
512580	515580	Okay, so we know that
515580	518580	We found out that these planets rotate
518580	521580	Can I ask a question?
521580	524580	So you mean all the black lines are pretty accurate
524580	527580	So you mean all the black lines are pretty accurate
527580	530580	The masses are not the same
530580	533580	The distribution is not the same
533580	536580	So you can imagine that there are 31 sets of blue and red lines
536580	539580	So you can imagine that there are 31 sets of blue and red lines
539580	542580	I just want to emphasize that it is getting more and more obvious when you get close to the periphery
542580	545580	It's too fast
545580	548580	It's so fast that it's weird
548580	551580	So at this time
551580	554580	You see this person called Vicky
555580	558580	He noticed this when he was observing the Small Magellanic Orbit
558580	561580	He noticed this when he was observing the Small Magellanic Orbit
561580	564580	So he is the first to propose this
564580	567580	So there is actually a blue light cloud
567580	570580	So there is actually a blue light cloud
570580	573580	I draw it up to tell you that there is something there
573580	576580	But in fact you can't see the blue light
576580	579580	There is a black hole, a light cloud
579580	582580	Dark matter
582580	585580	It is a mass
585580	588580	It is also radiating gravity
588580	591580	It is also radiating gravity
591580	594580	These things are symmetrical
594580	597580	Many people did not believe it until it was proposed
597580	600580	Many people did not believe it until it was proposed
600580	603580	Vera Rubin did a very careful measurement
603580	606580	For many galaxies
606580	609580	This is a typical example
609580	612580	We can observe what we see
612580	615580	Its behavior
615580	618580	How much gravity affects it
618580	621580	Then we can see what can radiate gravity
621580	624580	How much can we really see
624580	627580	Then we compare the difference
627580	630580	Then we find that there is a part of the mass that we can't see
630580	633580	This is easier to understand
633580	636580	But in fact, dark matter has a lot of
636580	639580	There are a lot of different scales
639580	642580	It can be attributed to dark matter
642580	645580	It can be attributed to dark matter
645580	648580	What you see in the upper left corner
648580	651580	Is the rotation curve
651580	654580	Second, what you see in the upper right corner
654580	657580	All the light spots are a galaxy cluster
657580	660580	All the light spots are a galaxy cluster
660580	663580	In other words, that a light spot
663580	666580	There are so many galaxies
666580	669580	It looks like a big universe
669580	672580	It looks like a big universe
672580	675580	This is a simulation
675580	678580	The black part is dark matter
678580	681580	It makes the background of the universe white
681580	684580	If there is no dark matter in the universe
684580	687580	In this simulation
687580	690580	There is no way to form enough gravity to attract the matter
690580	693580	It is not heavy enough
693580	696580	It is not heavy enough
696580	699580	So there are a lot of dark matter
699580	702580	It is closer to the cosmic web
702580	705580	It is closer to the cosmic web
705580	708580	Then the gravity will quickly suck in the visible matter
708580	711580	So dark matter can be explained well
711580	714580	If you look at the lower left corner
714580	717580	First, I want to say that the blue light cloud and the red light cloud in the lower left corner are added
717580	720580	The blue light cloud and the red light cloud in the lower left corner are added
720580	723580	There are not seen
723580	726580	Do you see the red part?
726580	729300	It means that it has observed X-ray emission
729300	732300	Do you see the blue part?
732300	735440	It means that it has observed X-ray emission
735440	738340	It is under the effect of limited sunlight
738340	741340	It is under the effect of limited sunlight
741340	744460	The equivalent effect of GANS
744460	747480	It is the opposite of GANS
747560	750440	The blue parts on two sides are soaked with GANS
750440	753460	The red parts are soaked with X-ray emission
753460	756380	The red parts are soaked with X-ray emission
756560	759240	In this graph, the two galaxy clusters clash
759240	762060	In this graph, the two galaxy clusters clash
764660	767860	When they clash, the 2 clusters pass
768620	771520	We know that when these clusters collide
771520	774500	The closest cluster will generate X-ray
774500	775760	The closest cluster will generate X-ray
776040	778820	They look like two sprays of water
778820	781820	They look like two sprays of water
781880	784720	But there are two masses
784720	785720	But there are two masses
785720	788720	They run far away
788720	790220	They don't interact
790680	793680	They don't interact with the matter we know
793680	797180	They don't interact with the matter we know
799080	801680	This is called a Bully Cluster
801720	805040	This can also give a very strong constraint
805140	808140	It is massive and it doesn't work
808140	810140	In the lower left corner
810500	812840	In the lower left corner
812900	816220	We can see the light blue and green
816220	819220	We can see the light blue and green
819220	822220	This is our galaxy
822220	825220	If we observe from the earth
825220	828220	This is the background of the universe
828220	831220	This is the background of the universe
831220	834220	The red part is hot, the blue part is cold
834400	837400	This is the radiation of the universe
837400	840400	The red part is hot, the blue part is cold
840400	843400	If I make this galaxy
843400	846400	If I make this galaxy
846400	849400	2D Fourier Transform
849400	852400	You can see the shape of the light bulb
852400	855400	You can see the shape of the light bulb
855400	858400	90 degrees, 18 degrees, 1 degree
858400	861400	90 degrees, 18 degrees, 1 degree
861400	862400	0.2, 0.1, 0.07
862580	865580	What is the axis of gravity
865580	868580	Correlation
868580	871580	The heat is directly related between the two points
871580	874580	The heat is directly related between the two points
874580	877580	The heat is directly related between the two points
877580	880580	The chance is basically this
880580	883580	In other words, this blue and green
883580	886580	In other words, this blue and green
886580	889580	At about 1 degree
889580	892580	Or 0.7 degrees or 0.5 degrees
892580	895580	Or 0.7 degrees or 0.5 degrees
895580	898580	So its density will mainly appear at these angles
898580	901580	So its density will mainly appear at these angles
901580	904580	This is very interesting
904580	907580	We first have to ask how the universe's background radiation is produced
907580	910580	The background radiation of the universe is in the very distant early universe
910580	913580	The background radiation of the universe is in the very distant early universe
913580	916580	When these lights are no longer with the very chaotic matter in the universe
916580	919580	When these lights are no longer with the very chaotic matter in the universe
919580	922580	After the Big Bang
922580	925580	It recorded the temperature of that location
925580	928580	What is the temperature
928580	931580	Temperature is the density of the location
931580	934580	Because the higher the density, the greater the pressure
934580	937580	The higher the temperature, the more heat, the more radiation
937580	940580	So we observe the distribution of the CMB map
940580	943580	So we observe the distribution of the CMB map
943580	946580	How is the quality distributed in the universe
946580	949580	How is the quality distributed in the universe
949580	952580	We can find one thing from this
952580	955580	To be so closely distributed
955580	958580	Like you see this spectrum
958580	961580	If only the quality in the universe we see now is not enough
961580	964580	If only the quality in the universe we see now is not enough
964580	967580	We need more quality
967580	970580	They will first be crowded together because of gravity
970580	973580	They will first be crowded together because of gravity
973580	976580	Then their gravity will help lighter matter
976580	979580	Then their gravity will help lighter matter
979580	982580	It's like a right-hand corner map
982580	985580	It's like a right-hand corner map
985580	988580	The story is very similar
988580	991580	If only the matter we see is not heavy enough
991580	994580	To form the CMB map
994580	997580	To form the CMB map
997580	1000580	Here we can tell us
1000580	1003580	There are many observations in the universe
1003580	1006580	There are many observations in the universe
1006580	1009580	The observed matter physics is basically particle physics
1009580	1012580	It's not consistent with gravity
1012580	1015580	It's not consistent with gravity
1015580	1018580	A good direction is to think
1018580	1021580	Some things in our model have mass
1021580	1024580	Some things in our model have mass
1024580	1027580	We can explain it
1027580	1030580	This is dark matter
1030580	1033580	I will stop here
1033580	1036580	Do you have any questions?
1036580	1039580	It will be more technical
1039580	1042580	It will be more technical
1042580	1045580	Do you have any questions?
1045580	1048580	You can ask a difficult question
1048580	1051580	I want to ask a simple question
1051580	1054580	I want to ask a simple question
1054580	1057580	I want to ask a simple question
1057580	1060580	Do you know about the Fermi Law?
1060580	1063580	Do you know about the Fermi Law?
1063580	1066580	Do you know about the Fermi Law?
1066580	1069580	Want to know about Fermi Law?
1069580	1072580	Want to know about Fermi Law?
1072580	1075580	Want to know about Fermi Law?
1075580	1078580	want to know about Fermi Law?
1109580	1112580	Questions
1112580	1115580	Because some galaxies are large
1115580	1118580	Because some galaxies are large
1118580	1121580	Because some galaxies are large
1121580	1124580	Because some galaxies are large
1124580	1127580	Because some galaxies are large
1127580	1130580	Because some galaxies are large
1130580	1133580	Because some galaxies are large
1133580	1136580	Because some galaxies are large
1136580	1139580	It's curious, isn't this my job?
1139580	1142580	Isn't this my job?
1142580	1145580	Can you hear me?
1145580	1148580	Let me ask
1148580	1151580	Regarding the explanation
1151580	1154580	Because there is dark matter
1154580	1157580	It has weight but it can't be seen or observed
1157580	1159580	It's just an explanation
1159580	1161580	Is there any other explanation?
1161580	1164580	Try to explain this matter
1164580	1167580	And I'm very interested
1167580	1170580	But first, it's hard to do experiments in a short time
1170580	1172580	So I'm not doing it now
1172580	1174580	But I've been thinking
1174580	1176580	I told you that gravity is not wrong
1176580	1178580	It's just that there are some matters you can't see
1178580	1181580	The other best explanation is that gravity is wrong
1181580	1184580	Is this okay?
1184580	1186580	Yes, gravity is wrong
1186580	1188580	The answer is this
1188580	1190580	Why is gravity wrong is interesting
1190580	1192580	Because we always know
1192580	1194580	Quantum mechanics works very well
1194580	1197580	It can explain almost everything we see
1197580	1199580	Even if it can't explain
1199580	1201580	It can also be based on quantum mechanics
1201580	1203580	Give you a good model
1203580	1205580	Except for one thing, we have no idea
1205580	1207580	Is gravity
1207580	1209580	We can't quantize it
1209580	1211580	Then quantize can normalize
1211580	1213580	It becomes a good theory
1213580	1215580	So many people always think
1215580	1217580	Another good explanation is dark matter
1217580	1219580	Is a good example
1220580	1222580	Some very important and we don't know
1222580	1224580	In these places
1224580	1226580	It will be with the traditional gravity we know
1226580	1228580	Or quantum mechanics is incompatible
1228580	1230580	Of course, there are many ways to explain
1230580	1232580	We can talk about it later
1232580	1234580	But basically this is my answer
1234580	1236580	Gravity may be wrong
1236580	1238580	This is also a direction
1238580	1240580	Because I actually
1240580	1242580	Stay in high school and university physics
1242580	1244580	Let me feel like
1244580	1246580	Maybe it sounds like etheric
1247580	1249580	A little hypothetical
1249580	1251580	This is just a model
1251580	1253580	I agree
1253580	1255580	Thank you
1259580	1261580	Let's start talking about technical things
1261580	1263580	First of all, what you see here
1263580	1265580	Is what we know so far
1265580	1267580	Dark matter
1267580	1269580	Should say
1269580	1271580	On the table
1271580	1273580	Dark matter model
1273580	1275580	You see the lightest
1276580	1278580	That z is 10-
1278580	1280580	369 12 15
1280580	1282580	21 24
1282580	1284580	Small z is 10-24
1284580	1286580	Square EV
1286580	1288580	This is the quality unit
1288580	1290580	If you are not familiar with EV
1290580	1292580	EV is the weight of the electron
1292580	1294580	So it's so light
1294580	1296580	10-24 square electron weight
1296580	1298580	The heaviest
1298580	1300580	Can be so heavy
1300580	1302580	He can't use EV
1302580	1304580	He is 30 solar weight on the right
1305580	1307580	But we usually don't talk about
1307580	1309580	PEV
1309580	1311580	10-15 square electron weight
1313580	1315580	Obviously we don't understand this problem
1315580	1317580	Don't understand
1317580	1319580	We can build up
1319580	1321580	If you can imagine
1321580	1323580	These things in the range
1323580	1325580	May be a good model
1325580	1327580	And not ruled out
1327580	1329580	But the most important thing
1329580	1331580	You can see that there are two groups
1331580	1333580	A group on the right
1333580	1335580	WIMP
1335580	1337580	Hidden Sector Dark Matter
1337580	1339580	Hidden Thermal Relic
1339580	1341580	Asymmetric Dark Matter
1341580	1343580	Freezing Dark Matter
1343580	1345580	SIMP
1345580	1347580	On the left
1347580	1349580	Exia
1349580	1351580	Ultralight
1351580	1353580	What is the main difference
1353580	1355580	The main difference is
1355580	1357580	The heavier one
1357580	1359580	It will calm down
1359580	1361580	You can imagine
1361580	1363580	In the process of cooling
1363580	1365580	It will cool down
1365580	1367580	Stop at a point
1367580	1369580	Like a dot
1369580	1371580	In our galaxy
1371580	1373580	Like a planet
1373580	1375580	Rotate like a dust
1377580	1379580	Ultralight on the right
1379580	1381580	Is the best name
1381580	1383580	It's so light
1383580	1385580	Its material wave is very long
1385580	1387580	So long
1387580	1389580	It may be as big as a galaxy
1389580	1391580	So you can't define
1391580	1393580	It is a point like
1393580	1395580	Particle or wave
1395580	1397580	Or matter wave
1397580	1399580	So it has a very strong
1399580	1401580	Coherence interaction
1401580	1403580	Of course
1403580	1405580	In other words, it will not cool down
1405580	1407580	OK
1407580	1409580	But the point we want to talk about today
1409580	1411580	Is these particle-like
1411580	1413580	Instead of wave-like
1413580	1415580	So we will focus on today
1415580	1417580	This orange part
1417580	1419580	This orange part
1419580	1421580	Is the so-called thermal relic
1421580	1423580	For thermal relic
1423580	1425580	Experts don't need me to explain
1425580	1427580	According to my explanation
1427580	1429580	In the process of cosmic cooling
1429580	1431580	It will cool down
1431580	1433580	Localize
1433580	1435580	Point-like
1435580	1437580	Then of course
1437580	1439580	According to our observations on astronomy
1439580	1441580	We can have some
1441580	1443580	Restrictions
1443580	1445580	These particles can't be less than
1445580	1447580	Can't be more than
1447580	1449580	Hundreds of T.E.V.
1449580	1451580	This is the range
1451580	1453580	OK
1453580	1455580	The next page is
1455580	1457580	How do we measure
1457580	1459580	What you see here is a
1459580	1461580	It's like a Feynman diagram
1461580	1463580	It's not a Feynman diagram
1463580	1465580	In other words, this chi or this big X
1465580	1467580	Is the dark matter
1467580	1469580	Dark matter
1469580	1471580	Dark matter
1471580	1473580	If they interact
1473580	1475580	They can produce two
1475580	1477580	Standard model
1477580	1479580	We already know the particle
1479580	1481580	Then they may shoot out
1481580	1483580	For example, Neutrino, Gamma ray, X-ray
1483580	1485580	Or Lepton
1485580	1487580	Or even proton
1487580	1489580	Then you can use some
1489580	1491580	Measurement of cosmic radiation
1491580	1493580	If something like this happens somewhere in the universe
1493580	1495580	It may shoot out to the earth
1495580	1497580	The particle we can measure
1497580	1499580	For example, Anitta, IceCube, AMS, Fermi
1499580	1501580	OK
1501580	1503580	If you look at the top of this picture
1503580	1505580	Collider is basically the opposite
1505580	1507580	You take the Standard Model Particle
1507580	1509580	With another Standard Model Particle
1509580	1511580	Then put it together
1511580	1513580	Then hope this one
1513580	1515580	Matter energy will become
1515580	1517580	What is that called
1517580	1519580	Dark matter comes out
1519580	1521580	Then I put a quotation here
1521580	1523580	If both come out as dark matter, you're done
1523580	1525580	You can't see anything
1525580	1527580	But in Collider, if it comes out as dark matter
1527580	1529580	The other one is not dark matter
1529580	1531580	Then you have to go through another behavior
1531580	1533580	To understand what that part is
1533580	1535580	Then this is probably what Collider is doing
1535580	1537580	What is LHC, Bell
1537580	1539580	Or even there are many experiments
1539580	1541580	It is Accelerator
1541580	1543580	It may not be Collider
1543580	1545580	It may be to take this beam and hit a target
1545580	1547580	Then hope that target can shoot something
1547580	1549580	That is also the concept
1549580	1551580	OK, today our focus is
1551580	1553580	Direct Detection
1553580	1555580	Direct Detection is this picture
1555580	1557580	Look up or look down
1557580	1559580	What does this mean
1559580	1561580	That is to say
1561580	1563580	Standard Model Particle
1563580	1565580	On the earth
1565580	1567580	We use it as a detector
1567580	1569580	Then there is a dark matter
1569580	1571580	Hit it
1571580	1573580	Then it bounced away
1573580	1575580	Then this time it was hit
1575580	1577580	Proton or Neutron or Electron
1577580	1579580	We use it as a detector
1579580	1581580	Will move, basically like this
1581580	1583580	It moves like a baseball
1583580	1585580	Then we measure this dynamic
1585580	1587580	Its concept is basically like this
1587580	1589580	The more famous one is
1589580	1591580	Liquid Noble Gas
1591580	1593580	Liquid Noble
1593580	1595580	It is a doping element
1595580	1597580	Turn it into a liquid
1597580	1599580	Or you can use Solid State
1599580	1601580	For example, semiconductor, superconductor, etc.
1601580	1603580	Then there are some people who use Cavity
1603580	1605580	But Cavity is usually not Thermal
1605580	1607580	So I won't talk about it today
1607580	1609580	Next page
1609580	1611580	Then we will focus on
1611580	1613580	So what is Direct Detection
1613580	1615580	You can see the picture on the right
1615580	1617580	Can I ask a question
1617580	1619580	You say
1619580	1621580	So
1621580	1623580	From the beginning
1623580	1625580	Everyone speculates that there is dark matter
1625580	1627580	This matter
1627580	1629580	It sounds like
1629580	1631580	Assuming
1631580	1633580	This gravity is right
1633580	1635580	Then
1635580	1637580	So I guess he must have
1637580	1639580	Some dark matter that I can't observe
1639580	1641580	So
1641580	1643580	Is it possible
1643580	1645580	Uh
1645580	1647580	In the last page
1647580	1649580	Those observations
1649580	1651580	Direct or indirect observation
1651580	1653580	The way of dark matter
1653580	1655580	I must
1655580	1657580	Is
1657580	1659580	Every way
1659580	1661580	Must rely on
1661580	1663580	The relationship above
1663580	1665580	To speculate the existence of dark matter
1665580	1667580	Ok
1667580	1669580	This is what I want to say first
1669580	1671580	What we are doing
1671580	1673580	Is hope
1673580	1675580	Except for this
1675580	1677580	We can really see
1677580	1679580	It's like a particle
1679580	1681580	Interaction
1681580	1683580	Instead of
1683580	1685580	Pure gravity
1685580	1687580	But the answer is
1687580	1689580	You are right
1689580	1691580	So far all the phenomena we have seen are
1691580	1693580	Only gravity
1693580	1695580	No one else
1695580	1697580	Why is it important
1697580	1699580	Other interactions
1699580	1701580	Understanding or restricting
1701580	1703580	Uh this model is very important
1703580	1705580	Important thing
1705580	1707580	Then I just said something wrong
1707580	1709580	That
1709580	1711580	I made a very stupid mistake
1711580	1713580	That is, the electronic quality is half MEV
1713580	1715580	Not half EV
1715580	1717580	Did I say EV?
1717580	1719580	Anyway, the electronic quality is MEV
1719580	1721580	Everyone will see
1721580	1723580	This quality is important
1723580	1725580	Ok, let's go back to the current projection
1725580	1727580	I have a question
1727580	1729580	I want to ask
1729580	1731580	Does anyone predict
1731580	1733580	How much is the distribution of dark matter
1733580	1735580	How is it
1735580	1737580	It is a
1737580	1739580	Now is
1739580	1741580	I can't imagine
1741580	1743580	It is
1743580	1745580	Dark matter is a
1745580	1747580	Particle
1747580	1749580	Such a thing exists
1749580	1751580	Then every particle
1751580	1753580	Has a certain quality
1753580	1755580	Or say
1755580	1757580	Any other way
1757580	1759580	To judge this dark matter
1759580	1761580	Is a group of things
1761580	1763580	That group of things
1763580	1765580	Various groups
1765580	1767580	A group of groups
1767580	1769580	Then each group does not necessarily have the same quality
1769580	1771580	Like this
1771580	1773580	Because now you look at your spectrum
1773580	1775580	It looks like a lot less
1775580	1777580	But it doesn't seem to say
1777580	1779580	If I have any
1779580	1781580	Prediction
1781580	1783580	Then it will be
1783580	1785580	A group of basic examples
1785580	1787580	Or is it a
1787580	1789580	Any group of quality
1789580	1791580	Any energy
1791580	1793580	Ok
1793580	1795580	The answer is we don't know
1795580	1797580	I can only tell you
1797580	1799580	Now the general assumption is
1799580	1801580	We measure the signal
1801580	1803580	Then we
1803580	1805580	Convert this signal to
1805580	1807580	Interaction
1807580	1809580	When these parameters
1809580	1811580	You now see the upper right corner
1811580	1813580	This picture
1813580	1815580	Dark matter
1815580	1817580	There is only one dark matter
1817580	1819580	Then the quality of the particle
1819580	1821580	That's the quality
1821580	1823580	This is the assumption
1823580	1825580	In many models
1825580	1827580	Dark matter can have more than one
1827580	1829580	Since there is more than one dark matter
1829580	1831580	Its quality will not be only one
1831580	1833580	So how it decays
1833580	1835580	Or how it interacts
1835580	1837580	Its scenario
1837580	1839580	But in order to be able to compare each other
1839580	1841580	Data
1841580	1843580	On the same basis
1843580	1845580	So now we usually assume
1845580	1847580	Dark matter has only one
1847580	1849580	Then we don't care what it is
1849580	1851580	We only care about its quality
1851580	1853580	Ok
1853580	1855580	Got it
1855580	1857580	Ok, let's go back to this page
1857580	1859580	In fact, I just told you a lot about this page
1859580	1861580	So how do we do it
1861580	1863580	In this galaxy
1863580	1865580	We built a detector on the earth
1865580	1867580	Then our solar system
1867580	1869580	Rotates inside
1869580	1871580	So we keep bumping into this
1871580	1873580	Our Milky Way
1873580	1875580	Dark matter
1875580	1877580	So it keeps changing
1877580	1879580	In other words, we are on the earth
1879580	1881580	With us as the coordinate
1881580	1883580	Is it okay?
1883580	1885580	This is our
1885580	1887580	If you are from this
1887580	1889580	Accelerator
1889580	1891580	This is our
1891580	1893580	Ok
1893580	1895580	You can see that there are three pictures below
1895580	1897580	Is dark matter
1897580	1899580	Dark matter
1899580	1901580	Sorry
1901580	1903580	With our
1903580	1905580	Normal matter
1905580	1907580	Neutron, proton, electron
1907580	1909580	Then run away like hitting a ball
1909580	1911580	This is the first
1911580	1913580	Its momentum transfer
1913580	1915580	Energy transfer
1915580	1917580	It's very simple
1917580	1919580	You just need to know how heavy the two balls are
1919580	1921580	Energy momentum conservation
1921580	1923580	The second one is more interesting
1923580	1925580	The second one is the picture in the middle
1925580	1927580	How to do it
1927580	1929580	If today
1929580	1931580	If there is a
1931580	1933580	Dark matter
1933580	1935580	With normal
1935580	1937580	We already know the matter
1937580	1939580	They will exchange each other
1939580	1941580	As long as they can
1941580	1943580	As long as they can
1943580	1945580	They have each other
1945580	1947580	This quantum number
1947580	1949580	Anyway, as long as they can
1949580	1951580	Conserve some property
1951580	1953580	They can walk around
1953580	1955580	Become another
1955580	1957580	What is hope
1957580	1959580	It becomes
1959580	1961580	Normal matter
1961580	1963580	Then we can measure it
1963580	1965580	The example you see below is
1965580	1967580	If today there is a dark matter like boson
1967580	1969580	Dark matter
1969580	1971580	It may have a certain chance to convert
1971580	1973580	The boson we know
1973580	1975580	Here is an example
1975580	1977580	Gamma
1977580	1979580	Gamma is the same as the electron
1979580	1981580	We can measure this
1981580	1983580	Photon out of nowhere
1983580	1985580	This is a dark matter signal
1985580	1987580	The third one
1987580	1989580	If dark matter
1989580	1991580	Is this A
1991580	1993580	If it comes in
1993580	1995580	This dark matter
1995580	1997580	It will decay itself
1997580	1999580	Two light
1999580	2001580	If your model
2001580	2003580	Usually we will find
2003580	2005580	You can have a process
2005580	2007580	If you help it
2007580	2009580	Supply another light
2009580	2011580	You see this B
2011580	2013580	It's usually a very strong magnetic field
2013580	2015580	You are crazy
2015580	2017580	Force it
2017580	2019580	I give you a foot
2019580	2021580	You go to another foot
2021580	2023580	So you can supply it
2023580	2025580	This magnetic field
2025580	2027580	It came in and measured the light
2027580	2029580	This is also a way
2029580	2031580	If you have this
2031580	2033580	You can do it
2033580	2035580	We are not a single channel search
2035580	2037580	We don't decide a channel
2037580	2039580	How it will decay
2041580	2043580	We put our detector
2043580	2045580	Then dark matter
2045580	2047580	We don't know what it is
2047580	2049580	But we know it continues to hit our detector
2049580	2051580	Then we see the signal
2051580	2053580	We go again
2053580	2055580	If it is this model
2055580	2057580	What would it be
2057580	2059580	So basically we are a bunch of models
2059580	2061580	Then interpret
2061580	2063580	What does it mean
2067580	2069580	What you see now
2069580	2071580	Is a very typical
2071580	2073580	Experimental results
2073580	2075580	That is to say
2075580	2077580	If I assume today
2077580	2079580	We want to look at dark matter
2079580	2081580	Nucleic acid
2081580	2083580	The contrast
2083580	2085580	What you see
2085580	2087580	Is the probability of action
2087580	2089580	You see down
2089580	2091580	The probability is getting smaller
2091580	2093580	What about the horizontal
2093580	2095580	Is this dark matter
2095580	2097580	How do I read
2097580	2099580	You assume a mass
2099580	2101580	For example, ETEV
2101580	2103580	Then you look up
2103580	2105580	Then see a certain line
2105580	2107580	Means
2107580	2109580	A conclusion
2109580	2111580	It's not right above this line
2111580	2113580	Why
2113580	2115580	Because if the quality of dark matter
2115580	2117580	Is this ETEV
2117580	2119580	Then the probability of action
2119580	2121580	Will be greater than 10 to the negative 44
2121580	2123580	Then I should have
2123580	2125580	In the size of my detector
2125580	2127580	And measuring time
2127580	2129580	See a lot of signals
2129580	2131580	But I didn't see anything
2131580	2133580	So at the level of confidence
2133580	2135580	I can say that it will never be greater than this value
2135580	2137580	Then I can assume that dark matter is a lot of different qualities
2137580	2139580	I can draw a line
2139580	2141580	Is the line you see
2141580	2143580	Is there a problem with this
2143580	2145580	It's okay
2145580	2147580	So basically
2147580	2149580	There are many lines
2149580	2151580	Each line is a different experiment
2151580	2153580	But
2153580	2155580	Every line
2155580	2157580	The gray dotted line
2157580	2159580	And then there is a grid
2159580	2161580	What does that mean
2161580	2163580	That's the sun
2163580	2165580	The sun is not always acting on this
2165580	2167580	This effect
2167580	2169580	We can't avoid
2169580	2171580	As long as we look at the sun
2171580	2173580	This is the sun's
2173580	2175580	Radiation
2175580	2177580	That
2177580	2179580	When your detector
2179580	2181580	I want to ask a question
2181580	2183580	That is to say, each line represents
2183580	2185580	Every experiment
2185580	2187580	It has a lot of models
2187580	2189580	Every experiment
2189580	2191580	It basically covers the model
2191580	2193580	No, this is usually one experiment
2193580	2195580	One model
2195580	2197580	Usually the data from the same experiment
2197580	2199580	Use different models to interpret
2199580	2201580	OK
2201580	2203580	Right
2203580	2205580	Anyway
2205580	2207580	Wait a minute
2207580	2209580	I'll answer the question first
2209580	2211580	What is the gray line
2211580	2213580	That gray line is when your experiment
2213580	2215580	When you get there
2215580	2217580	You will start to see the sun
2217580	2219580	Neutrino
2219580	2221580	And under the gradient
2221580	2223580	Under the gradient
2223580	2225580	You can't tell the difference between dark matter and neutrino
2225580	2227580	So you just
2227580	2229580	Basically
2229580	2231580	So that means
2231580	2233580	In this picture
2233580	2235580	When you put the rest
2235580	2237580	No white space
2237580	2239580	It means we
2239580	2241580	It's not possible to use
2241580	2243580	The method to detect
2243580	2245580	Unless you can distinguish
2245580	2247580	Neutrino and dark matter
2247580	2249580	The difference in signal
2249580	2251580	Otherwise you can't see it anymore
2251580	2253580	Yeah
2253580	2255580	OK
2255580	2257580	Any other questions
2257580	2259580	I have a question
2259580	2261580	I just don't understand
2261580	2263580	Is this line
2263580	2265580	Why is there a
2265580	2267580	Optimal
2267580	2269580	The mass
2269580	2271580	OK
2271580	2273580	I'll talk about this
2273580	2275580	Most of the lines are now
2275580	2277580	For example
2277580	2279580	Between 10-2 and 10-1
2279580	2281580	There is a
2281580	2283580	The deepest place
2283580	2285580	Why is it so deep
2285580	2287580	I'll talk about this later
2287580	2289580	OK
2289580	2291580	Sorry
2291580	2293580	I want to ask this
2293580	2295580	Is this a model-dependent
2295580	2297580	Search
2297580	2299580	Or is it a general search
2299580	2301580	Is it a model-dependent
2301580	2303580	Search or general search
2303580	2305580	Uh
2305580	2307580	In our field
2307580	2309580	Usually this picture
2309580	2311580	Model-independent
2311580	2313580	Search
2313580	2315580	Dark matter
2315580	2317580	With your nucleon
2317580	2319580	Elastic scattering
2319580	2321580	But
2321580	2323580	Literally
2323580	2325580	You still have some models
2325580	2327580	With nucleon
2327580	2329580	Elastic scattering
2329580	2331580	But
2331580	2333580	But this
2333580	2335580	So this picture is
2335580	2337580	Elastic scattering
2337580	2339580	And he has to assume one more thing
2339580	2341580	Dark matter has nothing to do with spin
2341580	2343580	If it has something to do with spin
2343580	2345580	You have to reduce the number of neutrons and neutrons
2345580	2347580	Because they will cancel
2347580	2349580	So that's a model
2349580	2351580	So to some extent this is not
2351580	2353580	Model-independent in text
2353580	2355580	But this thing is called model-independent
2355580	2357580	Because it is the widest
2357580	2359580	You can cover a lot of models
2359580	2361580	OK
2361580	2363580	Next page
2363580	2365580	If you put this here
2365580	2367580	This one is called limit plot
2367580	2369580	This range, take a look at it
2369580	2371580	What quality range
2371580	2373580	Throw it back to the model I just saw
2373580	2375580	You see it only digs that one
2375580	2377580	Little piece is called classical
2377580	2379580	WIMP
2379580	2381580	If you are doing high-performance, you will know
2381580	2383580	These things are all dug in
2383580	2385580	Weak scale
2385580	2387580	10 hundred times of weak scale
2387580	2389580	What is it
2389580	2391580	100
2391580	2393580	100 GeV to a few GeV
2393580	2395580	But this range
2395580	2397580	It's very wide
2397580	2399580	All these experiments are dug here
2401580	2403580	Sorry
2403580	2405580	What we want to do is ask a question
2405580	2407580	What about the other parts
2407580	2409580	What do we do
2409580	2411580	OK
2411580	2413580	So if you see this page now
2413580	2415580	I reduced the whole picture
2415580	2417580	Reduced to
2417580	2419580	This picture you see
2419580	2421580	Only the right side of this small piece
2421580	2423580	The gray part is where they are now
2423580	2425580	Digged
2425580	2427580	Then
2427580	2429580	The whole white one next to it
2429580	2431580	I didn't dig it all
2431580	2433580	Then I drew a lot on it
2433580	2435580	Various models
2435580	2437580	You can see it right away
2437580	2439580	The experiment they are digging
2439580	2441580	It's about 10 GeV to a few TeV
2441580	2443580	Basically they are very
2443580	2445580	Focus on this
2445580	2447580	Supersymmetric theory
2447580	2449580	MSSM
2449580	2451580	MSSM
2451580	2453580	Then according to different adjustments
2453580	2455580	Its parameters
2455580	2457580	It can slightly adjust its range
2457580	2459580	But basically they are all digging
2459580	2461580	These things
2461580	2463580	But in fact, there are a lot of dark matter models
2463580	2465580	You can see
2465580	2467580	For example
2467580	2469580	10 to 5 GeV
2469580	2471580	There are still very good models here
2471580	2473580	And it should
2473580	2475580	So it should be Thermorelic
2475580	2477580	What we want to ask is
2477580	2479580	What about these models
2479580	2481580	You can see it now
2481580	2483580	I showed it
2483580	2485580	That is
2485580	2487580	What you see now
2487580	2489580	I zoom in to these
2489580	2491580	Places that have not been dug
2491580	2493580	The actual line is already dug
2493580	2495580	The actual line you can see
2495580	2497580	It's all CDMS
2497580	2499580	So I said CDMS is Low Mass Dark Matter Search
2499580	2501580	Very important and
2501580	2503580	It's basically a world-leading sensitivity
2503580	2505580	Experiment
2505580	2507580	If you see the long
2507580	2509580	This virtual line
2509580	2511580	Is already doing
2511580	2513580	Then probably in a few years
2513580	2515580	The result will come out
2515580	2517580	Simulation expected results
2517580	2519580	The best thing to see
2519580	2521580	It should still be SNOLAB
2521580	2523580	Except for this NewsG
2523580	2525580	NewsG is quite above
2525580	2527580	But its MassReach can reach
2527580	2529580	Is 100 MeV
2529580	2531580	Then if you see that dot line
2531580	2533580	Dot line is that everyone has some concepts
2533580	2535580	Then they use some
2535580	2537580	Basic physical way
2537580	2539580	To estimate the reach of these concepts
2539580	2541580	So there are actually a lot of people
2541580	2543580	Thinking about this
2543580	2545580	But this thing is also
2545580	2547580	WIMP Search
2547580	2549580	Continuous
2549580	2551580	LHC
2551580	2553580	Effective machine
2553580	2555580	This community
2555580	2557580	This high-performance community is thinking
2557580	2559580	If not WIMP
2559580	2561580	Not SUSY
2561580	2563580	How to do
2563580	2565580	I will talk about
2565580	2567580	How did these lines come
2569580	2571580	I will be very fast
2571580	2573580	Skip a big part
2573580	2575580	Because I talked about it for a long time
2575580	2577580	Recap
2577580	2579580	So what is Elastic Scattering
2579580	2581580	Basically what you see now
2581580	2583580	Dark Matter comes in and hits your detector
2583580	2585580	Then you can measure Recoil Energy
2585580	2587580	Next is to answer
2587580	2589580	The question just asked
2589580	2591580	What is Elastic Scattering
2591580	2593580	It is basically a momentum transfer
2593580	2595580	You learned it when you were at PuWu
2595580	2597580	How much energy has passed
2597580	2599580	It's four times the energy
2599580	2601580	Then multiply
2601580	2603580	This two
2603580	2605580	Hit and hit
2605580	2607580	The quality of these two particles is not even
2607580	2609580	If one is very heavy, one is very light
2609580	2611580	Hit down
2611580	2613580	The quality and energy will not pass
2613580	2615580	When will it pass the most
2615580	2617580	In these two hits and hits
2617580	2619580	When their quality is the same
2619580	2621580	100% will pass
2621580	2623580	This also answers the question
2623580	2625580	Why everyone digs
2625580	2627580	Optimal point
2627580	2629580	Because it is used to build
2629580	2631580	The particle of the detector
2631580	2633580	It's almost in that position
2633580	2635580	It's so heavy
2635580	2637580	It is the most sensitive
2637580	2639580	Is this okay
2639580	2641580	Everyone can see
2641580	2643580	If my model today
2643580	2645580	My particle is probably GEV
2645580	2647580	Nucleon
2647580	2649580	These boxes are probably GEV
2649580	2651580	More than 900
2651580	2653580	About 1000
2653580	2655580	In the position of the earth
2655580	2657580	Gravity
2657580	2659580	The speed of rotation of all particles
2659580	2661580	About 300 km per second
2661580	2663580	Put the number in
2663580	2665580	You will see the energy
2665580	2667580	Probably
2667580	2669580	An X-ray energy
2669580	2671580	Just a few tens of keV
2671580	2673580	But if
2673580	2675580	Today you put your
2675580	2677580	Model from this box
2677580	2679580	Change to electronic
2679580	2681580	It's very, very light
2681580	2683580	At this time
2683580	2685580	You get the maximum
2685580	2687580	Momentum transfer
2687580	2689580	Will come from
2689580	2691580	A very light particle
2691580	2693580	Let's imagine today
2693580	2695580	The quality of the electronic is probably MEV scale
2695580	2697580	Half MEV scale
2697580	2699580	If you hit your particle at this time
2699580	2701580	It's also half MEV or MEV
2701580	2703580	At this time you put the number in
2703580	2705580	Your maximum energy detection
2705580	2707580	It can be from about 0.1 to
2707580	2709580	100 EV so much energy
2709580	2711580	It's probably less than sub keV
2713580	2715580	Then even
2715580	2717580	You have the mismatch of the mass
2717580	2719580	The dark matter you came in is
2719580	2721580	100 MEV
2721580	2723580	Sorry
2725580	2727580	Compare this energy
2727580	2729580	If you today
2729580	2731580	There is a 100 MEV
2731580	2733580	Mass
2733580	2735580	The dark matter hit your nuclear
2735580	2737580	It's GEV
2737580	2739580	You can probably see
2739580	2741580	Sub to 1 keV
2741580	2743580	This kind of energy
2743580	2745580	So if we can use
2745580	2747580	This method and then measure such a small energy
2747580	2749580	We can start to measure very light particles
2751580	2753580	But if we go back to that page
2753580	2755580	If you have a dark matter as heavy as electronic
2755580	2757580	To hit your nuclear
2757580	2759580	It will leave us one thousandth of the energy
2759580	2761580	It's basically very difficult to measure
2763580	2765580	What do you mean by Coherent?
2765580	2767580	What do you mean by Coherent?
2769580	2771580	First of all, I want to explain what Coherent is
2771580	2773580	Coherent is
2773580	2775580	If you have dark matter today
2775580	2777580	The size of its wave packet
2777580	2779580	Probably
2779580	2781580	It's not the size of a nuclear
2781580	2783580	But the size of your entire atomic nucleus
2783580	2785580	The energy it hits
2785580	2787580	Coherent is smaller than
2787580	2789580	Nuclear binding energy scale
2789580	2791580	It's more like hitting the entire atomic nucleus
2793580	2795580	It's a hit on the entire atomic nucleus
2795580	2797580	All the nuclei
2797580	2799580	So the rate of this hit
2799580	2801580	You pick up this signal
2801580	2803580	The chance is with
2803580	2805580	How many atomic nuclei
2805580	2807580	The nucleus becomes positive
2807580	2809580	The wave amplitude becomes positive
2809580	2811580	So the probability is positive square
2811580	2813580	So the hit event rate
2813580	2815580	How many atomic nuclei
2815580	2817580	How many nuclei become positive square
2817580	2819580	But if it's electronic today
2819580	2821580	Because
2821580	2823580	Unless you can have an electronic
2823580	2825580	Bound state
2825580	2827580	Otherwise free electron
2827580	2829580	Or bound to
2829580	2831580	These electrons are far away
2831580	2833580	So you basically only hit one at a time
2833580	2835580	So there is no Coherent
2835580	2837580	Addition effect
2839580	2841580	OK?
2841580	2843580	Continue
2843580	2845580	As I said
2845580	2847580	If dark matter becomes photon
2847580	2849580	It will be absorbed by charged particles
2849580	2851580	So how much energy it absorbs
2851580	2853580	How much total energy
2855580	2857580	So recap
2857580	2859580	Low mass search
2859580	2861580	Basically called a few GeV
2861580	2863580	Or lighter
2863580	2865580	Basically you want to see very little energy
2865580	2867580	So you want your
2867580	2869580	Detector
2869580	2871580	Energy threshold
2871580	2873580	Very low
2873580	2875580	You can start to see very little energy
2875580	2877580	If you just go back to the picture
2877580	2879580	It has a deepest place
2879580	2881580	That place is usually marked
2881580	2883580	Its maximum energy transfer
2883580	2885580	But
2885580	2887580	Towards a smaller energy or lighter mass
2887580	2889580	Sensitivity
2889580	2891580	Suddenly shot very high and then there is no line
2891580	2893580	Because their energy threshold
2893580	2895580	Detector's trigger threshold is there
2895580	2897580	They can't shoot any smaller
2897580	2899580	So there is a very important idea
2899580	2901580	You have to have a very low
2901580	2903580	Threshold to measure very light particles
2903580	2905580	OK
2905580	2907580	Of course I just told you
2907580	2909580	There are a lot of new models
2909580	2911580	Dark sector, Asymmetric DM, Freezing DM
2911580	2913580	Blah blah blah
2913580	2915580	But how do we do this
2915580	2917580	Detector
2917580	2919580	Let me recap
2919580	2921580	We want to maximize
2921580	2923580	Momentum transfer
2923580	2925580	So if you want to measure light particles
2925580	2927580	The picture here
2927580	2929580	Asymmetric
2929580	2931580	Dark matter
2931580	2933580	Sorry
2933580	2935580	Blah blah blah
2935580	2937580	Dark matter mass
2937580	2939580	Asymmetric
2939580	2941580	Energy transfer, Momentum transfer
2941580	2943580	You see all kinds of different elements
2943580	2945580	Its peak
2945580	2947580	Different places
2947580	2949580	The lighter the element, the peak
2949580	2951580	You can probe lighter mass
2951580	2953580	Does this make sense
2953580	2955580	Electron recoil
2955580	2957580	It's the lightest
2957580	2959580	OK
2959580	2961580	Of course, in addition to this
2961580	2963580	You have to maximize energy transfer
2963580	2965580	You have to have very low noise
2965580	2967580	You have to have a very high signal-to-noise ratio
2967580	2969580	To be able to measure such a small energy
2969580	2971580	So you have to have sub-KEV sensitivity
2971580	2973580	Then if you want
2973580	2975580	Can measure
2975580	2977580	You have to have very, very good ability to
2977580	2979580	Shoot limit or you have to be able to see
2979580	2981580	Interaction probability
2981580	2983580	Or cross-section is very small
2983580	2985580	Then your
2985580	2987580	Fake event background event rate
2987580	2989580	Very, very low
2989580	2991580	OK, here I will quickly
2991580	2993580	Skip because I actually want to talk about the third part
2993580	2995580	Super CDMS
2995580	2997580	So what are we doing now
2997580	2999580	Sorry
2999580	3001580	I'll go back to that side
3001580	3003580	Is there a problem
3005580	3007580	No problem
3007580	3009580	Can you hear me
3009580	3011580	You said
3011580	3013580	In fact, my physics is probably only high school physics
3013580	3015580	But it sounds like
3015580	3017580	You assume
3017580	3019580	Dark matter particles
3019580	3021580	With normal matter particles
3021580	3023580	There are all kinds of different models
3023580	3025580	Then energy will be generated
3025580	3027580	So you measure this energy
3027580	3029580	Then learn that this
3029580	3031580	Dark matter
3031580	3033580	How much is the mass
3033580	3035580	Is that right
3035580	3037580	In this case
3037580	3039580	Suppose you do the experiment today
3039580	3041580	Then measured the energy
3041580	3043580	But this does not mean
3043580	3045580	That your assumption model is correct
3049580	3051580	Yes, you are right
3051580	3053580	So this situation
3053580	3055580	But this situation
3055580	3057580	Should still be able to get at least
3057580	3059580	Conclusion that dark matter does exist
3059580	3061580	So this experiment
3061580	3063580	The point is
3063580	3065580	Is to prove the existence of dark matter
3065580	3067580	Is this
3067580	3069580	I
3069580	3071580	The first is to prove the existence of dark matter
3071580	3073580	This is the most important
3073580	3075580	The second is basically
3075580	3077580	Under the same logic
3077580	3079580	What we are doing now
3079580	3081580	Basically no one sees dark matter
3081580	3083580	So we can keep
3083580	3085580	Some models propose
3085580	3087580	You should see dark matter here
3087580	3089580	You should see this sensitivity
3089580	3091580	You can't see it, we can remove them all
3091580	3093580	So we are actually
3093580	3095580	Narrow down the possible parameter space
3097580	3099580	Oh
3099580	3101580	Now the logic is basically like this
3101580	3103580	But you are absolutely right
3103580	3105580	If one day everyone starts
3105580	3107580	A certain cross-section
3107580	3109580	Then in a certain mass
3109580	3111580	Start to see the event
3111580	3113580	When dark matter is here
3113580	3115580	Think about it
3115580	3117580	How to measure these signals
3117580	3119580	To understand what it is
3119580	3121580	Ok
3121580	3123580	Thank you
3123580	3125580	What are we doing now
3125580	3127580	We are doing a time called cryogenic dark matter search
3127580	3129580	Cryogenic means super low temperature
3129580	3131580	What we are doing is like this
3131580	3133580	What you see now is this right side
3133580	3135580	It's a super thin or fold
3135580	3137580	Group of germanium
3137580	3139580	Its size
3139580	3141580	It's about 10 centimeters
3141580	3143580	Its thickness is 3.3 centimeters
3143580	3145580	Not kilometers, it's centimeters
3145580	3147580	So this is one you've never seen
3147580	3149580	Super big piece of germanium
3149580	3151580	Or silicon
3151580	3153580	You go out and buy wafer
3153580	3155580	It will never help you cut such a thick piece
3155580	3157580	But our detector looks like this
3157580	3159580	If you look at the left
3159580	3161580	This white line is dark matter
3161580	3163580	Knock on the atomic box and run out
3163580	3165580	Then see this blue one
3165580	3167580	It will dissipate heat
3167580	3169580	Then this heat dissipation
3169580	3171580	Because it is very, very low energy
3171580	3173580	It is very localized
3173580	3175580	Then at the same time
3175580	3177580	The electrons in your material
3177580	3179580	And this electric team
3179580	3181580	So it will shoot this red
3181580	3183580	Ok, this is the electronic electric team
3183580	3185580	So what are we measuring
3185580	3187580	We are measuring these electronic electric teams
3187580	3189580	At the same time we are also measuring phonon
3189580	3191580	We measured this phonon
3191580	3193580	And this electric team
3193580	3195580	We can see very, very small signals
3195580	3197580	Ok, the next page is talking about
3199580	3201580	Why do we have to measure at the same time
3201580	3203580	Electronic electric team
3203580	3205580	To measure phonon
3205580	3207580	If today
3207580	3209580	Particle is hit
3209580	3211580	That atomic box
3211580	3213580	It will be about 1 in 3
3213580	3215580	Its phonon energy
3215580	3217580	With ionization
3217580	3219580	Is the electric team
3219580	3221580	Energy ratio is about 1 to 3
3221580	3223580	Phonon is about 3 times
3223580	3225580	But if it hits today
3225580	3227580	Is that electron
3227580	3229580	100% electron
3229580	3231580	Its ionization energy
3231580	3233580	Is 100%
3233580	3235580	So there is a difference of 1 to 3
3235580	3237580	So if you see this picture next to it today
3237580	3239580	There will be a very obvious difference
3239580	3241580	So we can immediately identify
3241580	3243580	It is hit
3243580	3245580	Why is this important
3247580	3249580	Because if today
3249580	3251580	Is very heavy
3251580	3253580	It will not leave energy
3253580	3255580	It will leave energy
3255580	3257580	So you want to vary
3257580	3259580	This is a lot of energy
3259580	3261580	To hit the atomic box
3261580	3263580	Or we know
3263580	3265580	To hit the electron
3265580	3267580	So we have this ability
3269580	3271580	I want to skip this
3271580	3273580	So we are based on this ability
3273580	3275580	We made a detector
3275580	3277580	You see this big piece of crystal
3277580	3279580	There are a lot of small things on the surface
3279580	3281580	It is a super conductor
3281580	3283580	When it picks up energy
3283580	3285580	It will immediately from the superconductor
3285580	3287580	Turn into a normal conductor
3287580	3289580	In this fast
3289580	3291580	In the process of transformation
3291580	3293580	Its sensitivity is very large
3293580	3295580	A little bit of energy
3295580	3297580	Its electron will change a lot
3297580	3299580	So we can use this thing to do very, very precise measurements
3299580	3301580	At the same time, we also designed a very good
3301580	3303580	This
3303580	3305580	The distribution of electrons
3305580	3307580	In the lower right corner of this picture
3307580	3309580	If it is on the surface
3309580	3311580	Hit
3311580	3313580	Electrons and electrons will run to the same side
3313580	3315580	If you hit it in the middle
3315580	3317580	Electrons and electrons will be pulled to one side
3319580	3321580	Why is this important
3321580	3323580	Because most of the particles we already know
3323580	3325580	Relative to dark matter
3325580	3327580	It's easier to be blocked on the surface than in the middle
3327580	3329580	Because dark matter is the hardest to block
3329580	3331580	It will go to the middle
3331580	3333580	So the more to the middle, the more like dark matter
3333580	3335580	So we can do this
3335580	3337580	I don't want to talk about this at all
3337580	3339580	I just want to conclude
3339580	3341580	About this kind
3341580	3343580	Hit the nucleus or hit the electron
3343580	3345580	This kind of detector
3345580	3347580	In our expected detection time
3347580	3349580	We have 100% confidence
3349580	3351580	We can distinguish
3351580	3353580	Nuclear recoil or
3353580	3355580	Electron recoil
3355580	3357580	We can do a good job
3357580	3359580	Find dark matter
3359580	3361580	This kind of style
3361580	3363580	Dark matter search
3363580	3365580	In addition to this
3365580	3367580	We have another thing to use
3367580	3369580	This thing is called
3369580	3371580	HV detector
3371580	3373580	HV means high voltage
3373580	3375580	We are on this
3375580	3377580	Detector
3377580	3379580	Add a very large
3379580	3381580	This power plant
3381580	3383580	If it is released
3383580	3385580	Any free electronic electric team
3385580	3387580	It will be very fast
3387580	3389580	Speed ​​up
3389580	3391580	It's in this crystal
3391580	3393580	Middle speed
3393580	3395580	But the reason is that it can't exceed
3395580	3397580	So as long as it exceeds the middle speed
3397580	3399580	It is called heat dissipation
3399580	3401580	The meaning of heat dissipation
3401580	3403580	Is to create additional
3403580	3405580	Secondary phonon emission
3405580	3407580	So you add a big power plant to it
3407580	3409580	As long as you
3409580	3411580	Activate a free
3411580	3413580	Electronic electric team
3413580	3415580	You will get a lot of phonon energy
3415580	3417580	So
3417580	3419580	We can put very small
3419580	3421580	Enlarge to very large
3421580	3423580	So at this time
3423580	3425580	If your
3425580	3427580	Threshold is from your electronic
3427580	3429580	Noise
3429580	3431580	Our signal will be far greater than the noise
3431580	3433580	So we
3433580	3435580	Equivalent trigger
3435580	3437580	Trigger on specific recoil energy
3437580	3439580	Our threshold will be very, very low
3439580	3441580	We can lower the threshold by 100 times
3441580	3443580	If you give it 100 volts
3443580	3445580	This drift
3445580	3447580	The voltage
3447580	3449580	But what is his problem
3449580	3451580	Basically you are now
3451580	3453580	Electron recoil or nuclear recoil
3453580	3455580	You have completely lost the distortion
3455580	3457580	Electron recoil and nuclear recoil
3457580	3459580	But we can see very small energy
3459580	3461580	I don't want to talk about this
3461580	3463580	Basically just want to say
3463580	3465580	We have to build a big experiment
3465580	3467580	And then get it to very, very low temperature
3467580	3469580	Otherwise thermal agitation
3469580	3471580	Will keep creating thermal phonon
3471580	3473580	Ok
3473580	3475580	I jumped directly to the last page
3475580	3477580	Now everyone sees
3477580	3479580	There is a lot of radioactivity
3479580	3481580	What kind of money
3481580	3483580	What is this
3483580	3485580	Uranium
3485580	3487580	These things are all in our experimental environment
3487580	3489580	Then they will be radioactive
3489580	3491580	Is to shoot all kinds of particles
3491580	3493580	We want to make sure
3493580	3495580	All these elements are very, very
3495580	3497580	In our experiment
3497580	3499580	We can see
3499580	3501580	Just make sure that if there is really a signal today
3501580	3503580	I saw we have a lot of confidence
3503580	3505580	It will never be these impurities
3505580	3507580	Radioactivity
3507580	3509580	I don't want to skip this
3509580	3511580	This is basically to say
3511580	3513580	So we put all these
3513580	3515580	Background radioactivity
3515580	3517580	Then there is just said
3517580	3519580	IZ and HV detector
3519580	3521580	Germanium and silicon
3521580	3523580	Then put it on
3523580	3525580	You will see that in the end we can
3525580	3527580	Dig this piece
3527580	3529580	We haven't yet
3529580	3531580	This 2020 will start
3531580	3533580	It is expected to run for five years
3533580	3535580	You can dig this piece
3535580	3537580	Here is very sloppy
3537580	3539580	Is there a problem
3541580	3543580	Is this pink
3543580	3545580	This orange pink piece
3555580	3557580	Hey you say that again
3557580	3559580	Did you just detect all the detect functions?
3559580	3561580	Can you explain this place again?
3561580	3563580	Can you explain this place again?
3563580	3565580	Forget it
3565580	3567580	Let's talk about it at the end
3567580	3569580	It feels like it will be a long time
3569580	3571580	Actually, it's okay
3571580	3573580	This thing is what you think
3573580	3575580	Is
3575580	3577580	If you are today
3577580	3579580	I just didn't say if your dark matter
3579580	3581580	Hit the atomic box
3581580	3583580	There will be one-third of the ionization
3583580	3585580	One-third of the energy
3585580	3587580	Will also become a double pair
3587580	3589580	But if today your dark matter
3589580	3591580	It's 100%
3591580	3593580	If it's enough
3593580	3595580	Then these two scenarios
3595580	3597580	Will produce an electron and a double pair
3597580	3599580	That produces an electron and a double pair
3599580	3601580	Then I give it a high pressure
3601580	3603580	This high pressure will pull this electron
3603580	3605580	Accelerate to very fast
3605580	3607580	Accelerate to exceed its terminal speed
3607580	3609580	But when it exceeds the terminal speed
3609580	3611580	It must decelerate
3611580	3613580	Its principle is basically like this
3613580	3615580	It decelerates
3615580	3617580	It has to release energy
3617580	3619580	So basically
3619580	3621580	I don't care if I want to look at nuclear recoil
3621580	3623580	Or electron recoil
3623580	3625580	I'm starting to look at phonon now
3625580	3627580	What about the phonon I see
3627580	3629580	If today is nuclear recoil
3629580	3631580	It primary
3631580	3633580	There will be phonon
3633580	3635580	Then the ionization it creates at the same time
3635580	3637580	Pulled like this
3637580	3639580	There will also be secondary phonon
3639580	3641580	I look at nuclear recoil, I look at these two phonons
3641580	3643580	Phonon signal
3643580	3645580	But if today is electron recoil
3645580	3647580	I basically look at these electrons
3647580	3649580	After all were ionized
3649580	3651580	How many secondary phonons did they create
3651580	3653580	Probably like this
3653580	3655580	Is it clear to me?
3657580	3659580	Ok, keep going, thank you
3659580	3661580	Ok
3661580	3663580	This page
3663580	3665580	I want to skip
3665580	3667580	Ok, I'll just talk about this page
3667580	3669580	I'm starting to talk now
3669580	3671580	Sorry, I'm starting to talk now
3671580	3673580	So how do all these things integrate into the future
3673580	3675580	That is to say
3675580	3677580	We found one thing
3677580	3679580	I've been talking about it all the time
3679580	3681580	Today
3681580	3683580	If there is nuclear recoil
3683580	3685580	About one-third of the energy
3685580	3687580	You can still see one-third of the energy in ionization
3687580	3689580	Compared to your phonon energy
3689580	3691580	This thing
3691580	3693580	Probably right
3693580	3695580	Our best model now is called Linhardt
3695580	3697580	This is actually a half century old model
3697580	3699580	He explains
3699580	3701580	That is
3701580	3703580	The effect of electronic shielding on the atomic
3703580	3705580	Then you can see
3705580	3707580	One-third of this
3707580	3709580	I just talked about one-third of it
3709580	3711580	There is a blue line
3711580	3713580	This is the model
3713580	3715580	If you hit the energy
3715580	3717580	What is above 10 keV
3717580	3719580	It's all right
3719580	3721580	But below 10 keV
3721580	3723580	It's getting worse
3723580	3725580	But no one knows
3725580	3727580	Because no one could measure such a small energy
3727580	3729580	But now everyone can measure such a small energy
3729580	3731580	You have to measure very small energy
3731580	3733580	You can start detecting very small
3733580	3735580	Very light dark matter
3735580	3737580	So this thing becomes very important
3737580	3739580	So this is a very important direction
3739580	3741580	We are going to start studying
3741580	3743580	What is this ratio
3743580	3745580	This thing is very
3745580	3747580	Go hand in hand with low-threshold detector
3747580	3749580	Because you can't
3749580	3751580	You have to be able to measure such a small energy
3751580	3753580	Then you can start constraining this ratio
3753580	3755580	This ratio is currently
3755580	3757580	If you want to measure nuclear recoil
3757580	3759580	This is the highest level of certainty in your analysis
3759580	3761580	Then skip this page
3761580	3763580	The second one is
3763580	3765580	We can put this kind of high-voltage
3765580	3767580	How good is this kind of high-voltage detector
3767580	3769580	How good is this kind of high-voltage detector
3769580	3771580	What about a recent paper
3771580	3773580	Stanford has a group
3773580	3775580	They made this little chip
3775580	3777580	This little chip is about 1 cm x 1 cm
3777580	3779580	This is 1 cm x 1 cm
3779580	3781580	Just as big as a thumb
3781580	3783580	Then its thickness is 1 cm
3783580	3785580	1 cm or half a centimeter
3785580	3787580	Anyway, it's a
3787580	3789580	It's a gram-scale small detector
3789580	3791580	It's a gram-scale small detector
3791580	3793580	So it can block the dark matter
3793580	3795580	The rate is very low
3795580	3797580	But it is super optimized
3797580	3799580	This high-voltage
3799580	3801580	Look at the design of the phonon detector
3801580	3803580	Then what do you see now
3803580	3805580	Is to see the picture on the right
3805580	3807580	There is a single peak
3807580	3809580	It's 0, 1, 2, 3
3809580	3811580	These peaks are all separated
3811580	3813580	What is this
3813580	3815580	There is a signal in this crystal
3815580	3817580	Created a single electron hole pair
3817580	3819580	Double, triple electron hole pair
3819580	3821580	It can see the quantized electron hole pair
3821580	3823580	It can see the quantized electron hole pair
3823580	3825580	It can see the quantized electron hole pair
3825580	3827580	So this is
3827580	3829580	You have to test
3829580	3831580	To use HV detector
3831580	3833580	Optimal sensitivity
3833580	3835580	You can start counting
3835580	3837580	Single electron hole pair
3837580	3839580	Created by detecting phonon
3839580	3841580	So you can see here
3841580	3843580	Its energy threshold is super low
3843580	3845580	Its energy threshold is super low
3845580	3847580	It is 0.33eV
3847580	3849580	It can shoot
3849580	3851580	It only operates for one day
3851580	3853580	It only operates for one day
3853580	3855580	Within one day on surface
3855580	3857580	And it doesn't even have to go underground
3857580	3859580	To cover up those radioactivity
3859580	3861580	To cover up those radioactivity
3861580	3863580	This is the one I'm going to talk about
3863580	3865580	This is the one I'm going to talk about
3865580	3867580	This is the one I'm going to talk about
3867580	3869580	You can see
3869580	3871580	If I can use this
3871580	3873580	If I can use this
3873580	3875580	Now everyone wants to use this
3875580	3877580	Now everyone wants to use this
3877580	3879580	High voltage detector
3879580	3881580	In order to increase
3881580	3883580	It is offered tentest
3883580	3885580	It is offered tentest
3885580	3887580	It is offered tentest
3887580	3889580	It is offered tentest
3889580	3891580	It is offered tentest
3891580	3893580	You see the dots
3893580	3895580	You see the dots
3895580	3897580	You see the dots
3897580	3899580	Now there is a test called Sensai
3899580	3901580	Now there is a test called Sensai
3901580	3903580	It can do this
3903580	3905580	We think that Super CDMX can do
3905580	3907580	We think that Super CDMX can do
3907580	3909580	It can do
3909580	3911580	Lower than EMUV sensitivity
3911580	3913580	If we can optimize
3913580	3915580	If we can optimize
3915580	3917580	It is the nature of HV detector
3917580	3919580	It is the nature of HV detector
3919580	3921580	I want to skip this page
3921580	3923580	I want to skip this page
3923580	3925580	Next is that we can optimize
3925580	3927580	As I said, the phonon is a super conductor
3927580	3929580	As I said, the phonon is a super conductor
3929580	3931580	If, It is very sensitive
3931580	3933580	As long as it picks up a bit of energy
3933580	3935580	It accumulates from the super conductor
3935580	3937580	It accumulates from the super conductor
3937580	3939580	So we can measure a great change in electrons
3939580	3941580	So we can measure a great change in electrons
3941580	3944580	And here
3944580	3946580	When the plusion picks up the energy
3946580	3949580	When the plusion picks up the energy
3949580	3951580	It is the resistance of the virtual conductor
3951580	3953580	It is the resistance of the virtual conductor
3953580	3955580	Now if the vector is a super conductor
3955580	3957580	Now if the vector is a super conductor
3957580	3959580	If we connect it to the capacitor
3959580	3961580	It becomes a thermostat
3961580	3963580	So if the grand thermostat changes
3963580	3967580	It turns into the resonant freq
3967580	3969580	So if a as you can see on the map
3969580	3971580	So if a as you can see on the map
3971580	3973580	Today if the cuper pair gets broken
3973580	3975580	If the cuper pair gets broken
3975580	3977580	and the impedance changes
3977580	3979580	The resonant frequency will be different
3979580	3981580	The resonant frequency will be different
3981580	3985580	The interesting part is that every detector is small
3985580	3987580	So I can see the next page
3987580	3989580	So I can see the next page
3989580	3991580	This is super cdms snowlab detector
3991580	3993580	If you look at the bottom left
3993580	3995580	If you look at the bottom left
3995580	3997580	It has to connect a lot of small dds
3997580	3999580	It has to connect a lot of small dds
3999580	4001580	It has to connect a lot of small dds
4001580	4003580	It has to change the capacitor
4003580	4005580	It can make 12 pixels
4005580	4007580	Because even if the capacitor is 0
4007580	4009580	Because even if the capacitor is 0
4009580	4011580	It is still small
4011580	4013580	So you have to connect a lot of dds
4013580	4015580	So you can see the signal
4015580	4017580	So it can only make 12 pixels
4017580	4019580	But if you look at the right picture
4019580	4021580	This is what we are doing in the lab
4021580	4023580	We use the way of super cdms
4023580	4025580	We use the way of super cdms
4025580	4027580	We can make every small square
4027580	4029580	We can make every small square
4029580	4031580	So basically we are doing 80,100,200 pixels
4031580	4033580	So basically we are doing 80,100,200 pixels
4033580	4035580	So this technology has been demonstrated
4035580	4037580	So this technology has been demonstrated
4037580	4039580	The energy resolution is the same as the TX
4039580	4041580	The energy resolution is the same as the TX
4041580	4043580	It's very easy to do
4043580	4045580	It can save a lot of money
4045580	4047580	It can save a lot of money
4047580	4049580	It can save a lot of money
4049580	4051580	OK that is what we want to do now
4051580	4053580	OK that is what we want to do now
4053580	4055580	There is also another aspect
4055580	4057580	What we kept talking about
4057580	4059580	What we kept talking about
4059580	4061580	We want to use it as a target
4061580	4063580	For dark matter
4063580	4065580	For dark matter
4065580	4067580	We can measure smaller energy
4067580	4069580	We can measure smaller energy
4069580	4071580	It's not exactly right
4071580	4073580	In fact, we want to do
4073580	4075580	We want to do
4075580	4077580	We want to do
4077580	4079580	First, the primary target
4079580	4081580	We want to do
4081580	4083580	We want to do
4083580	4085580	We want to do
4085580	4087580	But second
4087580	4089580	It picks up the energy it wants to measure
4089580	4091580	It picks up the energy it wants to measure
4091580	4093580	It must have an excited state to jump on
4093580	4097580	That's what we're looking at right now
4097580	4099580	That's what we're looking at right now
4099580	4103580	Half brain
4103580	4107580	Except, there are more
4107580	4109580	For example, like
4109580	4111580	For example, like
4111580	4113580	But the temperature will drift
4113580	4115580	But the temperature will drift
4115580	4117580	But the temperature will drift
4117580	4119580	Or like diamonds
4119580	4121580	Or like diamonds
4121580	4125580	These semiconductors have different bandgaps
4125580	4127580	Now a lot of people are thinking
4127580	4129580	Can we pick up more fancy materials
4129580	4131580	For example, gallium arsenide
4131580	4133580	These materials
4133580	4137580	To optimize the bandgap
4137580	4139580	We can pick up less energy
4139580	4141580	We can pick up less energy
4141580	4143580	Another interesting thing is
4143580	4145580	Germanium silicon is a pure material
4145580	4147580	It has no polarization
4147580	4149580	But if there is gallium arsenide today
4149580	4151580	It will have a very strong dipole
4151580	4153580	So it will produce
4153580	4155580	I need to supply
4155580	4157580	I need to supply
4157580	4159580	I just said at the beginning
4159580	4161580	If I can supply a single particle
4161580	4163580	I can force it to keep running
4163580	4165580	There will be a very strong coupling
4165580	4167580	So materials like gallium arsenide
4167580	4169580	So materials like gallium arsenide
4169580	4171580	Axion-like particles or photon coupling
4171580	4173580	Axion-like particles or photon coupling
4173580	4175580	This is the first
4175580	4177580	But I can go further
4177580	4179580	Can I find
4179580	4181580	Smaller materials
4181580	4183580	For example, superconductor
4183580	4185580	For example, superconductor
4185580	4187580	Or superfluid helium
4187580	4189580	Now the bandgap is directly from
4189580	4191580	EV to mini-EV
4191580	4193580	You can measure very small energy
4193580	4195580	This is far future
4195580	4197580	This is far future
4197580	4199580	If you look at the picture in the lower right corner
4199580	4201580	If you look at the picture in the lower right corner
4201580	4203580	If you use scattering
4203580	4205580	Or EM absorption
4205580	4207580	Or EM absorption
4207580	4209580	What we are doing now
4209580	4211580	What we are doing now
4211580	4213580	If you see the semiconductor in the middle
4213580	4215580	If you see the semiconductor in the middle
4215580	4217580	Or scintillator
4217580	4219580	Basically ionization
4219580	4221580	Basically ionization
4221580	4223580	Traditionally the only thing that can be dug into WIMP
4223580	4225580	Traditionally the only thing that can be dug into WIMP
4225580	4227580	But in the future
4227580	4229580	Many people are thinking to use superfluid
4229580	4231580	Many people are thinking to use superfluid
4231580	4233580	Or superconductor as a target
4233580	4235580	This is also a direction
4235580	4237580	This is also a direction
4237580	4239580	What did I say today?
4239580	4241580	Let me summarize
4241580	4243580	In the dark matter community
4243580	4245580	In the dark matter community
4245580	4247580	There is a paradigm shift
4247580	4249580	From classical WIMP
4249580	4251580	Everyone started to pay more attention to low mass dark matter
4251580	4253580	Everyone started to pay more attention to low mass dark matter
4253580	4255580	For example, in the EV scale
4255580	4257580	There may be Daryl, Neutrino
4257580	4259580	Or in the MEV, Dark Sector
4259580	4261580	There are many models that can be done
4261580	4263580	Traditionally, when doing WIMP search in dark matter
4263580	4265580	Everyone only cares about nuclear recoil
4265580	4267580	Because it's very heavy in that scale
4267580	4269580	You just want to hit the nuclear
4269580	4271580	You won't have a signal when you hit the electron
4271580	4273580	But now everyone is starting to pay attention
4273580	4275580	Electron recoil and nuclear recoil
4275580	4277580	Electron recoil and nuclear recoil
4277580	4279580	It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology
4279580	4281580	It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology
4281580	4283580	It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology
4283580	4285580	About this
4285580	4287580	I think it's fair to say
4287580	4289580	Super CDMX is the best
4289580	4291580	Basically, we have iZip
4291580	4293580	Can do ERNR discriminating
4293580	4295580	Tagging search
4295580	4297580	Or I can do
4297580	4299580	Ultra low threshold, ultra small energy search
4299580	4301580	Ultra low threshold, ultra small energy search
4301580	4303580	Future
4303580	4305580	I want to be able to measure
4305580	4307580	More technology
4307580	4309580	Can measure smaller recoil
4309580	4311580	I want to have better calibration
4311580	4313580	To understand
4313580	4315580	How much ratio it has in NR
4315580	4317580	You can see ionization
4317580	4319580	What we can do now
4319580	4321580	Ionization quantum counting detector
4321580	4323580	Ionization quantum counting detector
4323580	4325580	I just introduced
4325580	4327580	In addition to measuring the change of electrons
4327580	4329580	Ultrasound sensor
4329580	4331580	Can also be used to measure the change of electrons
4331580	4333580	It has many benefits
4333580	4335580	The most important thing is
4335580	4337580	Eventually we want to measure
4337580	4339580	Thermorelic lower bound
4339580	4341580	Thermorelic lower bound
4341580	4343580	Probably KEV
4343580	4345580	If I remember correctly
4345580	4347580	KEV
4347580	4349580	ER
4349580	4351580	Electron
4351580	4353580	Because I want to have a very light target
4353580	4355580	I can maximize my energy
4355580	4357580	Thank you
4375580	4377580	Um, do you have any questions?
4379580	4381580	What is this clip?
4381580	4383580	Oh, this is a very good question
4383580	4385580	Oh, this is a very good question
4385580	4387580	Um
4387580	4389580	What is this
4389580	4391580	Um, I'm back
4393580	4395580	Is this a toy?
4395580	4397580	Yes, this is a toy
4397580	4399580	Look at the bottom right corner of this video
4399580	4401580	Look at the bottom right corner of this video
4401580	4403580	There is a called the particle zoo
4403580	4405580	If you google the particle zoo
4405580	4407580	It is a company
4407580	4409580	It has a lot of dolls
4409580	4411580	All we know
4411580	4413580	Hypothetical
4413580	4415580	Or all kinds of particles
4415580	4417580	Are made into toys
4417580	4419580	The black square is dark matter
4419580	4421580	All other people
4421580	4423580	It's all cotton
4423580	4425580	Only dark matter is sand
4425580	4427580	Because it is very heavy
4427580	4429580	That's probably the concept
4429580	4431580	But that's because it was a model
4431580	4433580	I think it can start to sand cotton
4433580	4435580	I think it can start to sand cotton
4435580	4437580	OK
4439580	4441580	Is this a business statement?
4441580	4443580	No, it's not
4443580	4445580	Should not be a business statement
4445580	4447580	It's a
4447580	4449580	I don't know if it's still running
4449580	4451580	It seems to have become a bit like a non-profit
4451580	4453580	It's a company that accepts people's donations
4453580	4455580	Because business is not good
4457580	4459580	It's cool to open a website
4459580	4461580	Sorry
4461580	4463580	Any other questions?
4469580	4471580	Someone asked first
4475580	4477580	Then I'll ask first
4479580	4481580	Zhang Youning
4481580	4483580	Everyone has their own opinion
4483580	4485580	What to measure
4485580	4487580	Different methods
4489580	4491580	Eliminate
4491580	4493580	Improving the ratio of information
4493580	4495580	Then your
4495580	4497580	Talk will talk about it
4497580	4499580	Do you have a
4499580	4501580	Value or a definition
4501580	4503580	Theoretical scientist
4503580	4505580	He said
4505580	4507580	If we measure something
4507580	4509580	Or when we get to a certain value
4509580	4511580	We call it measured
4511580	4513580	Or
4513580	4515580	Prove that there is a dark matter value
4515580	4517580	Up to 99.97
4517580	4519580	Have
4521580	4523580	Basically your question is
4523580	4525580	How do I define
4527580	4529580	Correct
4529580	4531580	The answer is
4531580	4533580	The answer is
4533580	4535580	There are two ways
4535580	4537580	You actually don't know
4537580	4539580	Your background
4539580	4541580	What should it look like
4541580	4543580	What is the probability
4543580	4545580	If so
4545580	4547580	Is to put your background
4547580	4549580	This rate
4549580	4551580	Keep erasing
4551580	4553580	It's in you
4553580	4555580	It's in you
4555580	4557580	Your experiment
4557580	4559580	Then according to your
4559580	4561580	The size of the experiment
4561580	4563580	Theoretically it should not appear
4563580	4565580	Any
4565580	4567580	OK
4567580	4569580	That
4569580	4571580	If it should not appear
4571580	4573580	Then today you measured it once
4573580	4575580	Then
4575580	4577580	I can tell you
4577580	4579580	What is the probability of it
4579580	4581580	But you measured 30
4581580	4583580	Then ask
4583580	4585580	How much confidence do you have
4585580	4587580	This is from another source
4587580	4589580	This is a very common statistic
4589580	4591580	Right
4591580	4593580	But the key to this whole thing is
4593580	4595580	You have to put your background
4595580	4597580	You can't see it at all
4597580	4599580	You will know when you see it
4599580	4601580	The second one
4601580	4603580	That is
4603580	4605580	If you have a background
4605580	4607580	Appearance frequency
4607580	4609580	Or for a certain parameter
4609580	4611580	Parameter you can measure
4611580	4613580	There is a certain understanding
4613580	4615580	OK
4615580	4617580	Then you have a curve
4617580	4619580	You can see what you see
4619580	4621580	In this parameter you can measure
4621580	4623580	Distribution above
4623580	4625580	OK
4625580	4627580	Then if there is
4627580	4629580	A big one
4629580	4631580	Beyond your model
4631580	4633580	You can't see it
4633580	4635580	You will have enough confidence to say
4635580	4637580	How much confidence it is
4637580	4639580	Is with
4639580	4641580	This distribution is not consistent
4641580	4643580	Do you understand
4643580	4645580	Did I explain
4645580	4647580	Um
4647580	4649580	I understand
4649580	4651580	Just
4651580	4653580	You just mentioned
4653580	4655580	How much
4655580	4657580	My understanding is probably like this
4657580	4659580	Um
4659580	4661580	Hey i think
4661580	4663580	After the noise
4663580	4665580	The rest is the signal
4665580	4667580	Then the signal is that I have measured
4667580	4669580	I'm just curious
4669580	4671580	Can you recognize the cup or
4671580	4673580	Uh
4673580	4675580	Things like
4675580	4677580	Hey
4677580	4679580	Uh
4679580	4681580	I think
4681580	4683580	I think this is the case
4683580	4685580	No one should know where it will be measured
4685580	4687580	But
4687580	4689580	Uh
4689580	4691580	What to do now is that you can measure
4691580	4693580	A pile of signals
4693580	4695580	Then these signals give you enough
4695580	4697580	Confidence level
4697580	4699580	This is definitely not
4699580	4701580	What we expect to see
4701580	4703580	Then this is the cup
4703580	4705580	Oh
4705580	4707580	This is the conclusion, this means that it is a new thing
4707580	4709580	By definition it is dark matter
4709580	4711580	Right
4711580	4713580	Because we don't know
4713580	4715580	Super cdms threshold
4715580	4717580	5 sigma
4717580	4719580	Uh super cdms
4719580	4721580	Threshold you mean
4721580	4723580	Uh you mean
4723580	4725580	Detection or you mean
4725580	4727580	Detector itself
4727580	4729580	Signal to noise ratio
4729580	4731580	Uh i mean you measured the signal
4731580	4733580	With the cup
4733580	4735580	Oh yeah yeah
4735580	4737580	If we are
4737580	4739580	Eventually we want to send
4739580	4741580	Uh we
4741580	4743580	Want to send
4743580	4745580	If we want to claim detection
4745580	4747580	5 sigma
4747580	4749580	But um
4749580	4751580	The problem now is
4751580	4753580	If we are today
4753580	4755580	Not so good
4755580	4757580	Or we are
4757580	4759580	Select material
4759580	4761580	Not so good
4761580	4763580	Not very clean
4763580	4765580	Eventually
4765580	4767580	What is it
4767580	4769580	4 events
4769580	4771580	You can claim
4771580	4773580	I saw an event nearby
4773580	4775580	But the confidence level is very low
4775580	4777580	Or you can say
4777580	4779580	Uh this thing will degrade my limit
4779580	4781580	But I assume that I made a mistake
4781580	4783580	Uh i don't think
4783580	4785580	In the future we will
4785580	4787580	Like we used to do
4787580	4789580	Is that we will say
4789580	4791580	Hey we see
4791580	4793580	Signal and then we are
4793580	4795580	Draw a contour on the limit plot
4795580	4797580	But this contour is 90% confidence
4797580	4799580	I don't think we will do this in the future
4799580	4801580	We used to do this
4801580	4803580	But we
4803580	4805580	Should be quite clear in the future
4805580	4807580	We will only say at least 25
4807580	4809580	Because 25 is your zero background
4809580	4811580	If you are plus on fluctuation
4811580	4813580	You should be square root
4813580	4815580	At least 25
4815580	4817580	We might say uh we claim
4817580	4819580	See something
4819580	4821580	Uh
4825580	4827580	Correct
4827580	4829580	Any questions
4829580	4831580	Uh i'm curious
4831580	4833580	Is you
4833580	4835580	After this device is designed
4835580	4837580	What kind of experiment is it
4837580	4839580	To do validation
4839580	4841580	Is to confirm this instrument
4841580	4843580	Indeed doing what you want
4843580	4845580	Want to do
4845580	4847580	Just do validation
4847580	4849580	Uh i don't know
4849580	4851580	How to say
4851580	4853580	Um ok
4853580	4855580	I think this can go back to the page I just skipped
4855580	4857580	Very very messy
4857580	4859580	That page
4861580	4863580	I thought it might be
4863580	4865580	High-performance experiment
4865580	4867580	Detector people will be more interested
4867580	4869580	So i skipped
4869580	4871580	Ok ok what do you see now
4871580	4873580	What you see now is
4873580	4875580	Uh let's just say
4875580	4877580	Let's take a look
4877580	4879580	Let's just talk about the picture on the right
4879580	4881580	The picture on the right
4881580	4883580	You see a lot of different colors
4883580	4885580	Dot
4885580	4887580	This is horizontal
4887580	4889580	What you see is
4889580	4891580	I'm on the front
4891580	4893580	And the opposite side
4893580	4895580	Electricity
4895580	4897580	The difference in energy
4897580	4899580	Ok so it's
4899580	4901580	It's a normalization
4901580	4903580	Ok
4903580	4905580	That is to say
4905580	4907580	The difference in ionization
4907580	4909580	Then what you see is
4909580	4911580	Phonon and ionization
4911580	4913580	The ratio is the one I just said
4913580	4915580	One third is nr
4915580	4917580	Ok so you see a lot of different colors
4917580	4919580	This color is actually added later
4919580	4921580	Then you see me now
4921580	4923580	Circle up there
4923580	4925580	There is a thing called california cf252
4925580	4927580	This is a radiative element
4927580	4929580	It will always shoot out the middle finger
4929580	4931580	We basically put a middle finger
4931580	4933580	Radiator
4933580	4935580	Put it on our detector
4935580	4937580	That middle finger keeps hitting
4937580	4939580	We think this should be the signal we want to see
4939580	4941580	It should look like
4941580	4943580	Because if today is
4943580	4945580	Anything else
4945580	4947580	It will act as a battery interaction
4947580	4949580	Whether it's gamma ray
4949580	4951580	Whether it's IR photon
4951580	4953580	Or electron
4953580	4955580	Its
4955580	4957580	It will be immediately
4957580	4959580	Will act as a battery
4959580	4961580	Block down
4961580	4963580	What you see at this time
4963580	4965580	It's not like your dark matter
4965580	4967580	Dark matter won't do this
4967580	4969580	So basically
4969580	4971580	What we are looking for is neutral particle
4971580	4973580	Then a very strong neutral particle
4973580	4975580	Will hit the atomic box
4975580	4977580	Then we think this signal
4977580	4979580	It's like we can see
4979580	4981580	Dark matter
4981580	4983580	So you see this california cf252
4983580	4985580	Is neutral source
4985580	4987580	So in other words, we can tag it next to it
4987580	4989580	It's background
4989580	4991580	This comes from a very strong
4991580	4993580	EM interaction source
4993580	4995580	That's led 210
4995580	4997580	So we're the same
4997580	4999580	Put led 210 on our detector
4999580	5001580	Then see these signals
5001580	5003580	Then find out
5003580	5005580	As we expected
5005580	5007580	Where the background should go
5007580	5009580	We basically do this
5011580	5013580	Does this answer your question?
5013580	5015580	Yes
5015580	5017580	Then I have another one
5017580	5019580	A more extensive question is
5019580	5021580	If I understand
5021580	5023580	You guys have been following up
5023580	5025580	Able to measure
5025580	5027580	Because it can measure lighter
5027580	5029580	Mass
5029580	5031580	But if you only use a single
5031580	5033580	It's usually neutral
5033580	5035580	Then its mass is
5035580	5037580	I don't know much about physics
5037580	5039580	But in my impression, it should be
5039580	5041580	So you can't confirm
5041580	5043580	Your instrument can measure
5043580	5045580	Mass
5045580	5047580	That's right
5047580	5049580	I have to say
5049580	5051580	Unless we have a dark matter source
5051580	5053580	Can calibrate our detector
5053580	5055580	Otherwise we will never know
5055580	5057580	What it looks like
5057580	5059580	But if we can do that
5059580	5061580	We don't have to measure anymore
5061580	5063580	So you're totally right
5063580	5065580	So there are some assumptions here
5065580	5067580	The assumption here is
5067580	5069580	We take our neutral to hit it
5069580	5071580	The energy it leaves
5071580	5073580	Energy is energy
5073580	5075580	It's not because it's from
5075580	5077580	Neutron to hit
5077580	5079580	There is a difference
5079580	5081580	So what we measured today
5081580	5083580	How much energy does it leave
5083580	5085580	Then based on this energy
5085580	5087580	Say OK
5087580	5089580	So the response I see in this energy
5089580	5091580	Is it the response I expect to see in this energy?
5093580	5095580	So basically
5095580	5097580	I don't care if it's neutral
5097580	5099580	But this assumption is like this
5099580	5101580	If you leave
5101580	5103580	For example, 1 keV
5103580	5105580	But this 1 keV comes from dark matter or neutron
5105580	5107580	In the end, your detector will have a different response
5107580	5109580	Then this will be different
5109580	5111580	This is a systematic
5113580	5115580	But this is the best we can do
5115580	5117580	Because we don't have a dark matter source
5117580	5119580	I think I understand
5121580	5123580	Thank you
5125580	5127580	I want to ask a question
5127580	5129580	That picture can be
5129580	5131580	There is a picture of Sigma vs Max
5131580	5133580	It's behind
5133580	5135580	Drawing a lot of different experiments
5141580	5143580	This
5143580	5145580	I just want to ask
5145580	5147580	Just assume
5147580	5149580	We want to do a new experiment now
5149580	5151580	Or maybe
5151580	5153580	Or improve other experiments
5153580	5155580	Do you have any suggestions
5155580	5157580	For example, because these lines
5157580	5159580	It's probably
5159580	5161580	For example, its peak is probably
5161580	5163580	It's around 10
5163580	5165580	So if we want to do something else later
5165580	5167580	For example, further
5167580	5169580	Or do other experiments
5169580	5171580	You will feel
5171580	5173580	For example, we want to prove
5173580	5175580	Of course, the further to the left
5175580	5177580	Or basically
5177580	5179580	For example, the part above the xenon
5179580	5181580	Is also the direction we can do
5181580	5183580	That is, if
5183580	5185580	If you want to do other experiments
5187580	5189580	This picture is basically like this
5191580	5193580	There are two directions you can go
5193580	5195580	Because this is a 2D picture
5195580	5197580	So there are two directions you can go
5197580	5199580	One is horizontal and one is vertical
5199580	5201580	Let's talk about what it means
5201580	5203580	It means
5203580	5205580	If you go horizontally
5205580	5207580	Basically you are in the probe
5207580	5209580	Different dark matter mass
5209580	5211580	If you go down
5211580	5213580	It's the same mass in the probe
5213580	5215580	But smaller
5215580	5217580	Smaller
5217580	5219580	Interaction cross action
5219580	5221580	No problem
5223580	5225580	But why do these pictures show
5225580	5227580	A straight line down
5227580	5229580	Then diagonally up a straight line
5229580	5231580	Triangle
5231580	5233580	This is probably the principle
5235580	5237580	Detector has its own noise
5237580	5239580	Below this noise
5239580	5241580	Then you are completely
5241580	5243580	Always noise
5243580	5245580	So you can't measure
5245580	5247580	You can only be above this line
5247580	5249580	That is Trigger Threshold
5249580	5251580	So that Trigger Threshold defines
5251580	5253580	The energy you can measure
5253580	5255580	In other words, it basically defines
5255580	5257580	You can measure the smallest particle mass
5257580	5259580	So this is the left one
5259580	5261580	Very sharp straight line
5261580	5263580	The right side is diagonally up
5263580	5265580	This is a log-log picture
5265580	5267580	So it's a log-log straight line
5267580	5269580	This basically means
5269580	5271580	You assume
5271580	5273580	The larger the particle mass
5273580	5275580	The less you see
5275580	5277580	So
5277580	5279580	Without seeing or seeing the same rate
5279580	5281580	The situation you can set
5281580	5283580	The weaker the limit
5283580	5285580	Because this principle is very simple
5285580	5287580	Because you know we are here
5287580	5289580	Is this dark matter
5289580	5291580	How much is the mass density of Halo
5291580	5293580	But mass density must be converted
5293580	5295580	To number density
5295580	5297580	To the mass
5297580	5299580	So the heavier the particle
5299580	5301580	The less
5301580	5303580	So hit your rate
5303580	5305580	Is 1 over m less
5305580	5307580	Do you understand
5307580	5309580	So the line on the right is probably
5309580	5311580	This means
5311580	5313580	First, I don't think
5315580	5317580	Different experiments
5317580	5319580	It should be said that the same experimental technology
5319580	5321580	Basically it is set
5321580	5323580	Where is its Threshold
5323580	5325580	So the super straight line on the right
5325580	5327580	It's hard to move
5329580	5331580	So if you want to change the line on the right
5331580	5333580	Basically you have to change
5333580	5335580	New technology
5335580	5337580	Not to say
5337580	5339580	How to get it
5339580	5341580	It can run left and right
5341580	5343580	It can only run up and down
5343580	5345580	Basically these lines can only run up and down
5345580	5347580	OK
5347580	5349580	Is it 1 over F?
5349580	5351580	No no no
5351580	5353580	Because this is the mass
5353580	5355580	This is the cross section
5355580	5357580	So that line basically means
5357580	5359580	Your Threshold is there
5359580	5361580	The gray line on the left
5361580	5363580	The line in the area is not
5363580	5365580	Which one
5365580	5367580	The picture on the right
5367580	5369580	The picture on the left
5369580	5371580	Is this
5371580	5373580	Yes
5373580	5375580	It should not be written on it
5375580	5377580	You can follow
5377580	5379580	I'll explain that later
5379580	5381580	OK
5381580	5383580	So I don't think
5383580	5385580	Use existing technology
5385580	5387580	It should not be said that I don't think
5387580	5389580	This is a recognition
5389580	5391580	Use the same technology
5391580	5393580	The bigger you can build
5393580	5395580	The more you use
5395580	5397580	The conclusion is
5397580	5399580	In the same time
5399580	5401580	In theory, you can block more
5401580	5403580	So if you don't block
5403580	5405580	You can set a stronger limit
5405580	5407580	But basically can't run left and right
5407580	5409580	Run left and right
5409580	5411580	Is to use different technology
5411580	5413580	So different technology
5413580	5415580	What is this technology
5415580	5417580	Is to reduce your Threshold
5417580	5419580	So basically what you can find
5419580	5421580	Is to find a way to reduce Threshold
5421580	5423580	OK
5423580	5425580	So in this picture you can see
5425580	5427580	The most obvious Threshold
5427580	5429580	The lowest is the light green
5429580	5431580	I point to this place
5431580	5433580	Why
5433580	5435580	I think the answer is different from others
5435580	5437580	If you go to track
5437580	5439580	The label
5439580	5441580	You will see
5441580	5443580	Aluminum SC
5443580	5445580	10mEV
5445580	5447580	What is that
5447580	5449580	Aluminum superconductor
5449580	5451580	Its bandgap is 10mEV
5451580	5453580	In fact, it is less than 10mEV
5453580	5455580	But its order of magnitude is 10mEV
5455580	5457580	It can slide over there
5457580	5459580	That
5459580	5461580	The rest you see
5461580	5463580	The light blue, dark blue
5463580	5465580	Dark green
5465580	5467580	What are these things
5467580	5469580	These are all semiconductors
5469580	5471580	So it actually has a label
5471580	5473580	What is silicon
5473580	5475580	Garlium arsenide
5475580	5477580	Silicon
5477580	5479580	They just take silicon
5479580	5481580	In a different way
5481580	5483580	Readout or readout or assembly
5483580	5485580	They are all over there
5485580	5487580	Then it actually has a label
5487580	5489580	Its Threshold
5489580	5491580	Let me see
5491580	5493580	Semiconductor Threshold is 10mEV
5495580	5497580	10mEV
5497580	5499580	I personally think
5499580	5501580	Go to a smaller Threshold
5501580	5503580	And the order of magnitude difference
5503580	5505580	Is to change the material
5505580	5507580	Now CEMS
5507580	5509580	I think we are already
5509580	5511580	Master
5511580	5513580	Semiconductor
5513580	5515580	Technology
5515580	5517580	Yes
5517580	5519580	So there may be
5519580	5521580	In short, it is
5521580	5523580	It depends on the signal to noise
5523580	5525580	The threshold of noise
5525580	5527580	So basically
5527580	5529580	Unless you change the material
5529580	5531580	It is unlikely to move
5531580	5533580	I think long term is to change the material
5533580	5535580	But is it possible to move
5535580	5537580	Yes, you can understand
5537580	5539580	What is your noise
5539580	5541580	You can understand what your noise is
5541580	5543580	Maybe you can reduce it
5543580	5545580	Eventually you can assume
5545580	5547580	If you are noise-free
5547580	5549580	Probably still around that
5549580	5551580	Can you reduce noise
5551580	5553580	Just in this group
5553580	5555580	Semiconductor experiment
5555580	5557580	Can you be better
5557580	5559580	That's about it
5559580	5561580	OK
5561580	5563580	You can ask
5567580	5569580	It doesn't matter
5569580	5571580	You continue
5571580	5573580	I just thought
5573580	5575580	Dark Matter Halo
5575580	5577580	Because you just said
5577580	5579580	It rotates in the universe
5579580	5581580	Then we can accept it
5581580	5583580	Does it have a number
5583580	5585580	For example, like Collider
5585580	5587580	Will it be here
5587580	5589580	It is with the earth
5589580	5591580	Our detector
5591580	5593580	Relative to this
5593580	5595580	Dark Matter Halo
5595580	5597580	How much is the luminosity
5597580	5599580	There is this number
5599580	5601580	This can be calculated
5601580	5603580	Let me explain
5605580	5607580	OK
5607580	5609580	What this picture draws
5609580	5611580	The solar system is here
5611580	5613580	Right
5615580	5617580	We know
5617580	5619580	The sun revolves around the Milky Way
5619580	5621580	How fast
5621580	5623580	Right
5623580	5625580	We also know
5625580	5627580	We observe
5627580	5629580	Our track
5629580	5631580	The quality of the package
5631580	5633580	How much is the quality of pulling us
5633580	5635580	Right
5635580	5637580	So we immediately know
5639580	5641580	How much is there
5641580	5643580	Missing mass
5643580	5645580	Can it be
5645580	5647580	But this is total mass
5647580	5649580	But if I do
5649580	5651580	The same thing
5651580	5653580	But I started from the middle of the reactor
5653580	5655580	Can I just make
5655580	5657580	How to say
5657580	5659580	Delta R
5659580	5661580	How much is it
5661580	5663580	Do I know
5663580	5665580	Every radius
5665580	5667580	Dark Matter Density
5667580	5669580	How much
5669580	5671580	Right
5671580	5673580	How much
5673580	5675580	How much
5675580	5677580	How fast
5677580	5679580	I know
5679580	5681580	How much
5681580	5683580	How much
5683580	5685580	The only difference is
5685580	5687580	I don't know how heavy this particle is
5687580	5689580	So number density
5689580	5691580	You have to assume a mass
5691580	5693580	So number density
5693580	5695580	Basically depends on your model
5695580	5697580	But we actually know
5697580	5699580	What is this
5699580	5701580	Mass density
5701580	5703580	That's it
5703580	5705580	So that's model
5705580	5707580	Independent
5707580	5709580	But basically
5709580	5711580	But basically when we draw
5711580	5713580	Is to draw all the mass
5713580	5715580	A point becomes a line
5715580	5717580	I don't know how much this mass is
5717580	5719580	Every mass I draw
5719580	5721580	It becomes a line
5721580	5723580	OK
5723580	5725580	it is good
5725580	5727580	OK
5729580	5731580	OK
5731580	5733580	That should be the same
5733580	5735580	Thank you
5735580	5737580	OK
5739580	5741580	Time is almost up today
5741580	5743580	Do you have any questions
5743580	5745580	I have some questions
5749580	5751580	Can I ask
5751580	5753580	I have a little suggestion
5753580	5755580	I'm totally OK
5755580	5757580	Stay and ask questions
5757580	5759580	But because California is almost 9 o'clock
5759580	5761580	If the host wants to go home
5761580	5763580	Can go home
5763580	5765580	I don't know where you are now
5765580	5767580	Anyway
5767580	5769580	If you want to download it, you can download it
5769580	5771580	Anyway, the recording is over
5771580	5773580	Then we can continue to discuss
5775580	5777580	I am actually
5777580	5779580	I have one or two questions
5779580	5781580	but
5781580	5783580	I don't know if everyone has
5783580	5785580	That's it
5785580	5787580	Let's continue
5787580	5789580	I have a personal article
5789580	5791580	OK
5791580	5793580	OK
5793580	5795580	OK
5795580	5797580	Then I will stop the recording first
5797580	5799580	OK
