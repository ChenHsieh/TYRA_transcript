00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone, and welcome to the Terra Talks on April 27th, 2019.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Our speaker today is Dr. Zhang Changming,

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
who is currently working as a postdoc at Technical University of Munich in Germany.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Today's theme is Photoelectrochemical Solar Field Production, Progress and Prospects.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Changming did his undergraduate degree in Technical University of Munich,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
and then went to UC Berkeley to do his Ph.D. and postdoc.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
He is now doing his second research in Germany.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
We are very happy to welcome Changming to give us his latest speech. Thank you.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you, Yu-Tung. Hello everyone.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Can I speak like this?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yes.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
Sorry if my speech is a bit laggy today.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
It's 5 a.m. in Europe,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
and I'm having my first cup of coffee,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
so it might be a bit slow.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
If you have any questions,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
please feel free to interrupt me.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Looking back at the previous theme,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
it seems a bit too broad,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
but basically today I want to share with you

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
some of the results of the past two or three years.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
From our perspective,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
we need to use a lot of energy.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
According to statistics,

01:52.000 --> 02:02.000
the average energy consumption per year is 18 terawatts.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Of course, as technology advances, the number will continue to increase.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
It is estimated that in about 30 years,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
this number will increase to 60 terawatts.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
This means that we need to find a source of new energy.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
So far, most of this energy has come from so-called fossil fuels.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Of course, we have been burning fossil fuels,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
which means that we keep putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
We can also see that this is a project by UC San Diego.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
They started tracking the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from Hawaii in the 1950s.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
We can see that in 2015,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
this concentration has officially broken through the 400ppm level.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Of course, this also causes the so-called global warming problem.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
In order to solve this problem,

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
it means that we need to find a source of new energy at the same time,

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
and at the same time avoid creating more carbon dioxide.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
This means that we need to find some energy that does not emit carbon dioxide.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
A very ideal choice, of course, is solar energy.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
For example, here we can see that on the surface of the earth every year,

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
the input energy of solar energy is 120,000 terawatts.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
This is far more than what we need.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
So in recent years,

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
we also know that solar energy devices are increasing all over the world.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
But so far, it's about 300 to 400 gigawatts.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
So there is still some time to go on the energy of the device.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
But we can also predict that there is a problem.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
The source of solar energy is not a very stable source.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
It is related to the weather and the season.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
So we need to have a way to store the excess solar energy.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
In this regard, there are usually two directions.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
One, of course, is the so-called development battery.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
I won't talk about most of this today.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
It's not my own field.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
But in another part,

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
in addition to storing energy by battery,

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
my field is how to store the excess solar energy by chemical energy.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
How do we do this?

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Basically, our goal is to convert solar energy into fuel.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Our first method is the so-called electromagnetic method.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
It's two parts.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
No matter what method we use to generate electricity,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
the excess electricity is generated by electricity.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Then we can make an electromagnetic cell.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Our battery is here.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
We can put a blower in the positive and negative poles.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
For example, in the positive pole,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
where the oxidation reaction occurs,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
we can oxidize water into oxygen.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
In the negative pole, we convert water into hydrogen.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
This hydrogen can be stored.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Then it can be used as fuel.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Whether it's solar power,

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
or the source of the electric car with the fuel cell.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
This method is purely electromagnetic.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
To do this,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
for example, to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
In thermodynamics,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
we need about 1.23 volts.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
This is the most basic requirement.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
But in fact,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
no matter what chemical reaction we have,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
there is a so-called kinetic barrier.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
We have to overcome this barrier on both sides.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
In fact, we need about 1.7 to 1.8 volts

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
to do the so-called water-soluble reaction.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
This is one approach.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
The other approach is to combine these two steps into one.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
We directly convert light into fuel.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
How do we do this?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
For example, we can put an N-shaped semiconductor

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
in the positive pole.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
When we put the N-shaped semiconductor into the water,

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
there will be a shocky barrier on the interface.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
So its shock absorber and conductor will go up.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
After absorbing light, we have electromagnetic current.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Because of the band bending,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
the current will flow in the direction of the solution.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
This current can be used to

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
do the oxidation reaction,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
to oxidize water into oxygen.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
This means that if we do it this way,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
we need 1.7 to 1.8 volts.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
The voltage depends on

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
the band gap of the semiconductor.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
In terms of experience,

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
the light voltage can only do

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
up to 70% of the band gap.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
This means that if we want to use the same semiconductor

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
to provide voltage for the solution of water,

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
we need a semiconductor with a voltage above 2.5 eV.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
This means that most of the light in the solar system

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
is not easy to use.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
We can also improve our approach.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
We use different semiconductors in the positive and negative poles.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
For example, in the positive pole,

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
we use a N-shaped semiconductor with a slightly larger band gap.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Then we can do the oxidation reaction.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
After the short-wave long-wave light is absorbed,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
the long-wave long-wave light can still pass through.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
We use a smaller band gap.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
At this time, we use a P-shaped semiconductor.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
So its light electrons will run in the direction of the solution

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
to do the oxidation reaction.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
This is the bottom layer of the semiconductor.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
In this way, we can choose the most optimized band gap combination.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
We can use most of the light in the solar system

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
to produce enough light voltage

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
to produce the so-called CO2 photoreduction,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
which is more difficult

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
whether it is to produce hydrogen or the recently more popular,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
which is to convert CO2 into chemical fuel.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
So my research focuses on the so-called photoelectrochemical

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
solar energy conversion.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Today I will talk about

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
an example of a P-type photocastle.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
I will also introduce some N-type photoanodes.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
We want to find a suitable light-electrode material.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
How do we define the efficiency of a photocastle?

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
How do we find a photocastle with high efficiency?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Basically, when we develop a photocastle,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
we define its efficiency

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
based on how much light current we can get.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
For example, this is our photocastle in the middle.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
We can apply different potentials to the photocastle.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Then we measure how much current we have.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
We can carry out this experiment

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
without photocastle or photocastle.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
The gap in the middle is the so-called light current,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
which is to convert light into current.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Because there is current, it means

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
that a circuit is formed between the entire furnace and the photocastle.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
This means that there is a chemical reaction

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
between the furnace and the circuit.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Of course, the higher the light current, the higher the efficiency.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
Basically, the intensity of the light entering the photocastle

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
is defined, because it is the radiance of the sun.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
It is about the intensity of the global average.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So the light entering the photocastle is fixed.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
If we analyze this way, the light current we get

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
is related to the three efficiency factors of our material.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
The first efficiency factor is the efficiency of the photocastle.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Of course, the smaller the bandgap, the stronger the photocastle's ability.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
There will be more electromagnetic waves

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
under the same photocastle.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
After the electromagnetic waves are generated,

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
they need to move to the easy interface.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
During this process, there may be so-called recombination.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
The electromagnetic recombination disappears.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
This means that it will reduce our efficiency.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
So in order to have high charge separation efficiency,

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
we need our material to have a better carrier transport property.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
Finally, when our electromagnetic or electromagnetic waves

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
reach the surface of the photocastle,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
they need to do a charge transfer to the photocastle

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
to carry out our chemical reaction.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
But these reactions are usually slower

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
and have a connected barrier.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
So we will also have some efficiency losses.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Because these electromagnetic or electromagnetic waves

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
will stop at the surface

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
until there is enough time for the chemical reaction.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
During this waiting time, there will also be so-called surface recombination.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
In addition to these factors,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
we also hope that our material does not require

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
a too expensive method of synthesis

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
or does not require some very rare elements.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
It will be a little cheaper in terms of production cost.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Another point is that

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
these inorganic materials hate water very much.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
It is very different from the water that humans or animals need.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
These inorganic materials,

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
especially when you add a voltage to it in the water,

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
it is very likely to decompose or be unstable.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
In order to do this,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
we ultimately want to make this technology

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
into a large-scale mature technology

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
that can solve the energy problems of humans.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
So we hope that the cost is low,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
it is stable and efficient.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
So we can take a look at our current

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
so-called solar cell

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
some more mature semiconductors in this field,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
such as silicon.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
It is efficient enough.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
We also have very mature technology

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
that can do large-scale mass production,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
but it is unstable in water.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
The so-called tribozoic semiconductor is also very efficient,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
but it is basically unable to do large-scale mass production at present.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
They also have stability problems.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
So my own research and

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
many people in the academic world are currently studying the so-called

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
metal oxide.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
These are easier to manufacture

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
and at the same time quite stable in water.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
But a big common problem is that

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
these metal oxides are undergoing

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
so-called energy conversion.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
The efficiency of this application is

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
very, very different from silicon.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
Our goal is to find out why

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
the efficiency of these metal oxides is still so low.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
After understanding these reasons,

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
we hope to use these knowledge to guide us

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
to find a new material

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
that can meet these three needs at the same time.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
So in the first part, I will

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
use this example,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
the so-called copper iron oxide.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
It is a P-type photocasol.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Then in the second part, I will

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
mention some so-called copper vanadium oxide

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
as a photogano.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
The so-called photocasols

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
are a P-type material.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
After it is absorbed, it is easily

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
re-reacted on the surface.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Basically, most oxidants are N-type

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
because it is easy to have so-called oxygen vacancy.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
This is a native N-type defect.

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
So it is a bit difficult to find P-type oxidants.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
The most common P-type oxidant is

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
sulfuric acid or copper oxide.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
This material has actually been studied

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
in the field of solar cells quite thoroughly.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
In terms of solar cells,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
it can also have a pretty good efficiency.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
But the problem is that

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
we want to do photoelectrochemical energy conversion.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
In the water, this material is very, very unstable.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
It means that it will die in five minutes.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
The reason for the death is that

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
we can see that its conduction band is mainly

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
copper 4s orbital.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
After you light it up, the electrons in the conduction band

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
will convert a copper to a metal copper.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
It means that in a very short time,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
our oxidant will gradually be converted to metal.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
So how do we improve this material?

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
One way is to add a second metal.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
These are some common examples.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
The advantage is that

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
because we still have a copper in our material,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
these oxides are still native P-type.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Another advantage is that

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
after adding the second metal,

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
we can adjust our bandgap.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Either push the radiance band up

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
or lower the conduction band.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
In this way, our bandgap is reduced.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
We can use solar cells more efficiently.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Another advantage is that

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
after we change the character of the minimum conduction band,

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
we can reduce the chance of restoring the copper.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
We can make the material more stable.

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
So the first topic I want to talk about is

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
copper iron oxide.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
It looks like a very attractive material.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Because no matter copper or iron,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
there are a lot of elements in the earth.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
So the cost is very low in production.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
The structure is here.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
There are six oxides in every three iron atoms.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
So it's a composite structure of the surface.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Copper is a linear composite structure.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
It's basically a layer-by-layer structure.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Basically, if you look at the literature,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
there are many different ways

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
to composite this material.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
But there is a very interesting way.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Hello.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
I can't hear Tom's voice right now.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Did you accidentally mute yourself?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I just got back.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Okay.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I just had some...

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Can everyone see the screen now?

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
I can see it now.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Okay.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Can everyone see the screen now?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I can see it now.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Okay.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Did you cut off from here?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Yes.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Okay.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
So basically,

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
if you go back to the literature,

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
there are several different ways to composite copper iron oxide.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
The first way is called Sol-gel synthesis.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
It's basically a spin-coating method.

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
You can see from the image of the electronic microscope

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
that it's a pretty tight film.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
The blue data here is the so-called C-V curve.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
That is to say,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
under different voltages,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
how much light current do we have?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It has this up and down jump

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
because sometimes there is light,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
and sometimes there is no light.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
So the gap in the middle is the so-called photocurrent.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
The blue one is the so-called action-reduction reaction.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
That is to say,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
we put a lot of oxygen in copper iron.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Oxygen is also an easy-to-restore molecule.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
So we can see that

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
this material can effectively restore oxygen.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
But if we want to make it HER,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
so-called hydrogen evolution,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
which is to restore water to hydrogen,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
we don't see how much current there is.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
That means the surface of this material

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
is not very efficient for so-called hydrogen evolution.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
We also found that

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
the main problem is

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
when you put this material in the water,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
there will be a surface hydroxide layer.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
The electron will be trapped in this layer

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
instead of being transferred to the water to produce hydrogen.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But the interesting thing is

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
you can also synthesize this material in the so-called electromagnetic way.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
From the surface map of the electron microscope,

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
there are a lot of these small nanoparticles.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
That means its surface area is getting bigger.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
At the same time,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
the materials made by electromagnetic method

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
are not entirely pure carbon iron oxide.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
It is easy to have so-called copper oxide,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
the second oxygen bucket in it.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
This material is not only

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
compared with the previous SOLDIER,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
but it can also be used

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
for CO2 photoreduction, which is theoretically more difficult.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Our CO2 is a very stable molecule.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
Why are there so many differences in the activity

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
compared with the previous SOLDIER?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
We can see here that

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
the morphology is basically very different.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
And the purity of the material is also very different.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
So the first goal is to

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
make a controllable synthesis method.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
We can adjust the purity of the material

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
while maintaining the same morphology.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
In this way, we can determine

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
whether the source of this activity

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
is the activity of the material itself

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
or the activity of the secondary phase.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
The method we have is

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Reactive Sputtering.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
We have two targets, copper and iron.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
We can have two negative targets.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
We use argon plasma to hit the target

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
and deposit the material on the substrate.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
In this way, we can make a large-scale,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
easy-to-produce scale.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
For example, we can easily make 5x5 cm2.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
But in the industry,

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
it is easy to scale up to tens of centimeters.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
We can also adjust the ratio of copper and iron in the material.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
The middle is the ratio of copper and iron.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
In 1 to 1, we get a very pure carbon dioxide phase.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
We can see it from X-ray scattering

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
or from Laman-Campbell scattering.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
It is a very pure material.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
But when we add more iron,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
we can see some secondary phase.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
We can identify that it is mainly oxidized iron.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
On the other hand, if we put more copper in,

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
the secondary phase we see is 2 plus oxidized copper.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
After we have this series of materials,

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
we can make some more large-scale comparisons.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Whether it is the photoelectrochemical performance

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
or the material used to identify its optical properties,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
its carrier transport properties,

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
or the electronic structure of the material.

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
First of all, in the so-called photoelectrochemical performance,

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
we do the same measurement first.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
This is not the so-called hydrogen evolution.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
We add this sodium persafate.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
This is a so-called electron scavenger.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It means that it is also easy to be restored.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
If you still remember this tetrahedron,

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
we add a very easy-to-be-restored thing in the solution.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
It means that we assume that the last charge injection efficiency

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
is very efficient, which is basically 1.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
We can see that we get about 1 mA per cm2.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
So much current.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
But if we don't add this thing,

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
it means that we want to do a hydrogen evolution.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Our current density is reduced by about 20 times.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
This is the so-called pure material.

27:35.000 --> 27:41.000
If we look at the material in this series we just had,

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
in the case of the electron scavenger on the left,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
the density of the current is basically the same.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
But on the right, we can see that

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
in the case where the copper ratio is higher,

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
the density of our current is obviously higher.

28:02.000 --> 28:09.000
We can see that there is also another peak in the CV data.

28:09.000 --> 28:17.000
This peak means that there is an additional oxidation reaction in the material.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
If you still remember,

28:19.000 --> 28:26.000
these more copper samples are actually non-pure oxidized carbon dioxide.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
From this data, we can deduce that

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
especially in the lower right corner,

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
the higher current for CO2 reduction

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
is actually due to the oxidation of copper as a catalyst.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So no matter what,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
our copper dioxide is just a catalyst.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
On the surface, it can't restore CO2.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
But when you have an excess of oxidized copper,

29:01.000 --> 29:08.000
these oxidized copper will first be restored to oxidized arsenic or metal copper

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
to act as a catalyst.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
Next, we're going to do a light quality measurement.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
We're using the so-called spectroscopic isometry.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
We can analyze its absorption rate.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
We can also do a tau analysis.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
We find that it's an indirect semiconductor.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
The bandgap is about 1.43eV.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
Its direct bandgap is about 3.09eV.

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
But as we said earlier,

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
our light current density is about 1mA per cm2.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
But if we look at its bandgap at 1.4,

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
it can actually absorb a lot of light.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
If we compare the light we absorb

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
with the ratio of current we get,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
that's our conversion efficiency.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
If we calculate this efficiency,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
it's actually less than 10%.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
That means after more than 90% of the light is absorbed,

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
we can't take it out of the semiconductor interface.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
That means a lot of recombination occurs.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
This recombination,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
when we look at these new oxidizing materials,

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
it's a very common and the biggest limitation.

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
This is mainly a comparison.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
The gray one is the so-called photosymbol diffraction.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
That is to say, we measure the absorption of the material.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
After the material absorbs light,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
we convert the energy of light into heat.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
We can see that it has a very fast sharp onset.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
The red one is the so-called photo-to-current efficiency.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Its onset is also in the bandgap,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
but its increase is significantly slower.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
That means in visible light,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
at 500 to 800 nm,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
in this visible light area,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
a lot of light can be absorbed,

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
but it can't be used as a photo-to-current.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
At the same time, in the sub-bandgap,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
we see a relatively small absorption peak.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
We will come back to discuss what this is later.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
We say that these oxidizing materials,

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
especially the common limitation of super-resistant oxidizing materials,

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
is the so-called bulk recombination.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Why is it like this?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
If we look at these super-resistant metals,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
we look at its band structure,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
its 3D orbital is not fully filled.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
If we use the general band theory to look at it,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
it should actually be a metal material.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
Why are these oxidizing materials a semiconductor,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
even though it is a super-resistant material?

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
That's because these electrons have strong interactions with each other.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
That means that because of these interactions,

32:31.000 --> 32:39.000
our metal 3D band will split into the so-called sub-band and sub-band.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
At the same time, we have oxides in the oxidizing material.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
So depending on the oxygen 2P band

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
is in a place with lower energy

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
or a place with higher energy,

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
we can have these two types of insulators.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
One is the Moharber insulator,

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
which means that the sub-band and sub-band are all metal 3D.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
Or the sub-band is metal oxygen 2P

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
and the sub-band is metal 3D.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
No matter which type,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
in these oxidizing materials,

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
because they are, how to put it,

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
compared to the traditional silicon or 3-5 group semiconductors,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
the characteristics of these oxidizing materials are that

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
although they are also semiconductors,

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
but our electrons have to pass through them.

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
Because these oxidizing materials are more ionic,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
we have,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
so the electrons have to jump around in different atoms.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
For example, in this case in the upper right corner,

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
our electrons have to jump around in different metal atoms.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
And the electrons have to jump around in different oxygen atoms.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
This means that our electrons are very localized.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
In the process of localization,

34:03.000 --> 34:11.000
it will also change the structure of the metal around it.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
It means that the structure will be a little different.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
What does this affect?

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
It means that their mobility will be worse.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
Just like in ordinary silicon,

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
it doesn't have this localized electron problem.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
It's like going for a walk in the wild.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Basically, no one will stop you.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
You can go wherever you want.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
In these oxidizing materials,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
for example, there are a lot of people in Simending.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
If you want to go to a place,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
it means that the people you want to go to

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
have to leave a space for you to go there.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
It means that in the process of walking,

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
the environment around you will also change with you.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
Of course, the mobility will be much lower.

34:58.000 --> 35:05.000
We think that these oxidizing materials have poor charge mobility.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
At the same time, for this reason,

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
we have a lot of bulk recombination.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
How do we prove this hypothesis?

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
At the beginning, after oxidation,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
the electromagnetic electron localized

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
to produce the so-called polaron.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
This process is very fast.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
So we want to use the so-called

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
phantocyclic contraction absorption

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
to observe this phenomenon.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
Basically, a very typical measurement is like this.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
First, we use a very short pump pulse

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
to produce an oxidized state.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Because the oxidized state

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
has a different electronic arrangement from the machine,

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
so its absorption of different light will also be different.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
We can use the second probing

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
to measure the difference in absorption

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
of different oxidized states.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
We can change the delay between the pump and probe,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
so that we can follow

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
how it relaxes after producing the oxidized state.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
But this method is basically

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
applied to the liquid state at the beginning.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
We found that we are now

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
studying solid materials.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
So in addition to the so-called transmission,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
we also have to consider reflectivity.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
This means that we have to measure

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
the so-called transmission, transmission,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
and transmission reflectivity at the same time.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
I skipped some details,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
but the point is that

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
if we measure transmission and reflectivity at the same time,

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
we can return to the so-called differential absorption.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
In the case of solid materials,

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
we can see this kind of

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
first-order or third-order

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
differential signal.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
This is because different absorption oscillators

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
are either produced by shift

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
or oscillators by broadening.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
This is how we used another material

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
to build this analysis.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Back to our carbon monoxide,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
this is our transmission absorption data.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
We can see that there are many changes

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
in the area near the interwebbing gap and the interwebbing gap.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
At the same time, in the sub-webbing gap,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
that is, in the infrared part,

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
there is a very flat absorption.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
This is the so-called free carrier absorption,

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
which means that after being absorbed,

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
the free carrier absorption will appear in this area.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
This free carrier absorption is actually very short-lived.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
In about 1 picosecond,

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
this signal disappears.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
At the same time,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
for example,

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
near the interwebbing gap,

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
there is a relatively long-lived excited state.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
We think this is indirect evidence that

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
our free carrier localizes

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
and produces a polaron state.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
This means that after 1 picosecond,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
we don't have a real free carrier,

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
but a polaron.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
These polarons can still be charged transport,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
but their mobility is relatively much lower.

38:46.000 --> 38:52.000
Next, about the so-called electronic structure,

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
we first have a cooperation,

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
using the DFT plus U method to calculate,

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
to calculate the electronic structure according to the crystal structure.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
The middle part of 0 is the Fermi level.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
The low energy part on the left is the so-called valence band.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
We see that from the calculation process,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
at the top of the valence band,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
the closest to the valence band edge is

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
mainly the copper 3D electron.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
The lower part is the oxygen.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
The lower part is the so-called iron 3D.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
In the conduction band part,

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
there are two bands, iron 3D.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
The higher part is copper.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
We want to do an experiment to verify the calculation structure.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
The first experiment is to use the so-called XPS.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
It means that we use an X-ray

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
to isolate the valence band electron.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
According to the analysis of these photoelectron's

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
kinetic energy,

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
we can return the binding energy in the material.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
We can see that there are four peaks.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
The two peaks at the top are

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
similar to the copper in the calculation result.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
The next two peaks are

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
similar to the oxygen and iron.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
You may ask,

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
why does the ratio in the experiment

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
look different from the calculation?

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
That's because in the experiment,

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
the ionization cross-section of the X-ray

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
is different for different elements.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
In our experiment,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
the ionization cross-section of the copper

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
is much higher than that of the oxygen or iron.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
This explains why in our experiment,

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
the intensity of the two peaks at the top

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
is much higher than the other two peaks.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
We can also use the so-called X-ray emission.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
That means we also use the X-ray,

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
but now we isolate the electron.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Let's see how the electron of the valence band

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
returns the binding energy.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
In the process of returning the binding energy,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
we will emit an X-ray beam.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
We can analyze the beam of the X-ray beam

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
to get the distribution of the valence band.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Here we see that in the oxygen,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
the K-edge X-ray emission,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
we also see four peaks.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
In this process,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
because we are looking at the co-level excitation of oxygen,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
of course,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
when the valence band is returned,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
what we see is that

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
more electrons are returned from oxygen.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
That's why we see that

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
the intensity of the peak in the middle is higher.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
This is the valence band.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
The conduction band,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
in the calculation process,

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
we see that the two lowest conduction bands are iron,

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
mainly from the unoccupied iron orbital.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
We use the X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
In this method,

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
we measure from the co-level

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
to the unoccupied conduction band level.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
Then we can change the input X-ray energy

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
to see how much light can be absorbed.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
We can compare.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
For example, in oxidized iron,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
we see two peaks.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
This is because

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
for iron,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
it is also a triangular iron.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
There are six ions around it.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
It is an octahedral structure.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
So we can see that the 3D orbital of iron

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
is split into 1G and T2G levels.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
In carbon monoxide,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
we also see these two peaks

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
at the same energy.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
At a higher level,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
we find a new peak.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
According to our calculations,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
this may be produced

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
from the same unoccupied orbital.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
We can also do this calculation.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
This is also done with DFT,

43:26.000 --> 43:33.000
using the many-body X-ray absorption calculation.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
We can almost reproduce these three peaks.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
We can also choose

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
from the calculation results.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
These three different peaks

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
correspond to different final states.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
We can see that the first peak

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
is the non-bonding state of oxygen and iron.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
The second peak

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
is also the anti-bonding state between oxygen and iron.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
The highest energy peak

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
is the anti-bonding state of copper and oxygen.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
This means that we not only

44:06.000 --> 44:12.000
verified that our calculations were correct,

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
but also that the two lower peaks

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
were contributed by iron,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
while the highest peak was contributed by copper.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
We can understand how different peaks

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
or different conduction bands

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
interact with each other.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
How do we verify this?

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
We can combine the different X-ray spectrums

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
into the so-called

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
Resonance in Elastic X-ray Scattering.

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
Basically, we use different X-ray spectrums

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
to stimulate an electron

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
from the core level to the conduction band.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
But we can also change the energy of the injected X-ray.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
We can analyze

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
the X-ray emission

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
from the valence band.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
What are the different changes?

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
This is also done in the advanced slide source of Berkeley.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
Our sample is placed here.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
We have a green X-ray.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
We are analyzing the energy of the X-ray emission.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
If you still remember,

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
two slides ago,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
we said this is the K-H X-ray emission of oxygen.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
The middle peak

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
is the contribution from oxygen to P

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
in the valence band.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
The so-called RIGS data

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
is the same measurement,

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
but we change the different excitation energy.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
The diagram looks a bit complicated,

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
but the X-axis is the same X-ray emission.

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
The Y-axis is the different excitation energy.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
When we change the excitation energy,

46:11.000 --> 46:18.000
the shape of the X-ray emission changes a lot.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
In the first part, we can see the emission onset.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
When we increase the excitation energy,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
it moves to a higher energy level.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
This means our material is an indirect semiconductor.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Why?

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
In our direct semiconductor,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
the valence band maximum and condensation minimum

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
are in the same K-space.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
When we increase the excitation energy,

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
the X-ray emission moves to a lower energy level.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
But in the indirect semiconductor,

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
the valence band maximum and condensation minimum

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
are separated.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
When we increase the excitation energy,

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
the X-ray emission moves to a higher energy level.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
This is what we observe here.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
At the same time,

47:15.000 --> 47:24.000
we can see some other changes.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
For example, when we emit at these two peaks,

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
we can see that the peak at the low energy level is more obvious.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
But when we move to the third peak,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
we can't see this peak.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
Instead, we can see another sharp peak at the high energy level.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
This means that when we emit at this peak,

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
we are emitting at an unoccupied copper state.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
This means that our X-ray emission

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
will have more copper 3D characters in the valence band.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
In other words, when we emit at two low-energy peaks,

48:09.000 --> 48:15.000
we see our own emission and lower-energy iron 3D emission.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
But when we emit at the third peak,

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
which is the so-called unoccupied copper state,

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
we will see more copper 3D emission.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
This can explain the different changes we see.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
This means that we not only know

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
that we are an indirect semiconductor.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
The bandgap is 1.4 eV.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
We also know that our valence band is copper.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Our conduction band minimum is iron.

48:43.000 --> 48:50.000
This is a so-called metal-to-metal charge transfer semiconductor.

48:50.000 --> 48:58.000
We can also do a similar measurement at the so-called iron L-edge.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
In this method, we see that

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
X-ray emission and excitation energy are closely related.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
In this method, we can see that

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
the first diagonal line is the so-called elastic scattering.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
This means that it is the same energy as the X-ray emission.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
So basically nothing happens.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
But in the parallel direction,

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
we can see that there are two or three diagonal peaks.

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
This means that no matter what X-ray excitation energy we use,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
we all have a fixed energy loss.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
This is the same principle as our optical Raman scattering.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
In Raman, this fixed energy loss tells us

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
what is the energy of the lattice vibration.

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
In this technique, this fixed energy loss tells us some different information.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
How do we explain it?

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
We can also compare these different X-ray emissions.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
This is not absolute X-ray emission energy,

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
but how much energy loss there is in the following.

50:18.000 --> 50:24.000
In other words, we use a diagonal method to align these emissions.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
We see that there are three fixed energy losses.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
The first is about one electron volt.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
That is, no matter what energy we use to excite,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
we lose a fixed electron volt.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Why is this?

50:40.000 --> 50:46.000
This is the configuration of our ground state.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
It has five electrons and a high-spin configuration.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
When we do an X-ray excitation,

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
we have a cold hole.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
So we have an electric current at 2P.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
We have an extra electron in 3D.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
When it returns to the final state,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
it can return to its original state.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
That is, there is no energy loss.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
Or it can return to a quadrilateral state.

51:15.000 --> 51:20.000
This means that this energy loss is equivalent to

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
a spin from our ground state.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
This electron volt energy loss

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
represents a TD excitation energy loss.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
If you remember,

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
when we measured the absorption of light on both sides,

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
there was a small peak at the South Bank.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
It was at about 1,200 nanometers.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
If you convert it to the energy scale,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
it is actually an electron volt.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
This means that in practice,

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
we can actually observe this very weak absorption.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Then there are two other fans.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
What is the reason for this?

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
This is also the so-called intermediate state.

52:09.000 --> 52:14.000
At first, we put an electron in the iron conduction band.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Then we have an electric current.

52:16.000 --> 52:22.000
This intermediate state is actually coupling with other intermediate states.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
That means that when it returns to the final state,

52:25.000 --> 52:32.000
what we see can be a charge transfer from oxygen to iron,

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
or a charge transfer from copper to iron.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
When they return to the final state,

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
the energy difference from the initial state to the final state

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
will reflect the energy loss here.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
The first one we see is about negative five to negative six electron volts.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
Compared with our calculation results,

52:57.000 --> 53:03.000
it is a charge transfer from oxygen to iron.

53:03.000 --> 53:11.000
The energy loss in the middle is about two to four electron volts.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
It is actually several peaks coupled together.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
If we compare it with our optical absorption,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
we can see that there are three peaks.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
If we compare them,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
they can basically be put together.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
That means that the energy loss peak in the middle,

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
which is about three electron volts,

53:33.000 --> 53:40.000
is mainly due to the charge transfer from copper to iron.

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
This energy loss can also be compared with our optical absorption.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
In conclusion,

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
we used the Reactive Spotter to prepare this series of samples.

53:58.000 --> 54:06.000
We can separate the so-called impurity phase and morphology.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
We learned that

54:12.000 --> 54:18.000
carbon dioxide itself does not have CO2 reduction activity.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
This activity is mainly due to the fact that

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
when we have more copper,

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
the oxidized carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
We used a lot of different X-ray optical methods

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
to understand its electron structure.

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
We found that its valence band is mainly of copper 3D nature,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
and the connection band is of iron 3D nature.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
This means that

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
if we look at the structure of the metal,

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
we can see that it is a layer by layer structure of copper oxide or iron oxide.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
This means that if we can control the direction of the growth of the metal

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
on the magnetic back,

55:06.000 --> 55:13.000
maybe we can more efficiently separate the electrons and electrons

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
by using the Reactive Spotter.

55:16.000 --> 55:23.000
If we can control the direction of the growth of the metal in a regular way.

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
Okay, I think it's about time.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
Do you have any questions about this part?

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
Thank you, Chang-Ming, for the wonderful speech.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I'm going to stop the recording here,

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
and then we can start the Q&A.
