0	11720	Hello everyone, good morning, good afternoon or good evening. I am in California now, so I am very early now. Welcome to today's TerraTalk.
11720	28320	If you have participated in TerraTalk, you will know that we actually have an academic speech every week. The academic speech is actually for all our members to come up and share their research progress, but we are more special today, so there are more people.
28520	32940	Our topic today is what to do after Ph.D.
32940	35860	Youth Researchers Post-Graduate Development Conference
36420	39180	I will say it again, what to do after Ph.D.
39180	41820	Youth Researchers Post-Graduate Development Conference
42000	46980	Today is not a single speaker's speech.
47400	61940	The three speakers we mentioned today are Dr. Zhang Mujie, Dr. Zhou Yuxun, and Dr. Su Haowei. They are now distributed around the world in Taiwan, Israel, and Boston, USA, so they are also distributed in various cities.
61940	70400	Come and share with us that they are looking for their teeth, this change, and the new path of different positions now.
70700	77200	Let's not say much, let's invite the three speakers to introduce themselves separately.
79440	85000	At the beginning, I will use the name first, so that everyone does not know who to start with.
86000	89500	Can we first ask Mujie to introduce himself?
90780	97600	Hello everyone, I am Zhang Mujie, and I am now a assistant professor at the University of Taiwan's Department of Chemistry.
97600	112940	I returned to NTU in August last year, so it's been about a year, so if you have any questions, especially those related to Taiwan, you are welcome to ask.
115760	122500	Can you talk about your university, master's degree, and doctoral degree?
122500	132260	My university and research institute are both in NTU Department of Chemistry, and after I graduated from my master's degree, I worked as a research assistant for a little over a year.
132260	148400	Then I went to the University of Hollingham in the Netherlands to study for my doctorate, and after graduating from my doctorate in 2016, I went to Chicago University in the United States to do post-doctoral research, and came back in 2018.
148400	157360	So I did post-doctoral research for about two years, a little more than two years, and that's about it.
157700	163720	OK, let's ask Haowei to introduce himself.
165160	184240	Hello everyone, my name is Su Haowei, and I am now at Fitbit in Boston. We are a company that makes wearable devices called Fitbit, and I have been working here for about four years, and I have been in Boston for almost nine years.
184640	195840	I studied in Taiwan when I was in college, and then I came to the United States to study for my master's degree after I graduated from my doctorate, and then I stayed to work after I finished my studies.
196720	219200	In the field of work, I studied imaging in college, such as ultrasound and MRI, and then came here to do research in microfluidics. Now I mainly write algorithms and do some human experiments at work.
219520	234960	A small question, so you said that you have been in this company for about four years, and you have been in Fitbit for four years, but you have been there for almost ten years, right? So basically your PhD is in the best school in the world, is that right?
235280	242240	Yes, because I am talking about this from Caltech now, so I think it should be quite persuasive.
242880	247120	Don't be in school, don't be in school, really the best school.
247120	261440	Okay, so today we have three speakers, and Hao Wei is one of them in the industry. So if you have any questions about the industry, or want to go to the industry in the future, or want to do more applications, you can also ask questions.
261440	266000	Thank you, Hao Wei. Next, Yuxun, please speak.
292000	296000	I am completing my PhD.
304000	306000	It is a marriage proposal.
314000	316000	I am doing research in Israel.
322000	334000	Sorry, I am interrupting, because it seems like a lot of people can't hear Yuxun's voice.
336000	338000	I am not sure if Yanyong can hear you.
338000	340000	I can hear a little bit.
340000	348000	I can't hear you well here, and sometimes there is no sound at all, and sometimes there is a little bit.
348560	352560	Let me turn up the battery.
352560	354560	Can you hear me now?
354560	356560	Yes, I can hear you well now.
356560	358560	That's good.
358560	360560	Okay, let me quickly introduce myself.
360560	362560	I am an assistant professor at Caltech.
362560	370560	I finished my master's degree in physics at Caltech, and then I went to the National University of Transportation to do my research on nanoparticles.
371120	381120	After I finished my research, I went to the University of Michigan to do some physics-related research.
383120	389120	During this year and a half, I was very lucky to have a chance to go to Israel to do my research.
389120	393120	I got a fellowship and went to Israel to do my research.
393120	397120	During this time, I tried to join the so-called Einstein Project.
397680	401680	I was very lucky to get this project.
401680	409680	So today, I would like to share some details and skills needed to apply for the Einstein Project.
409680	419680	Also, I would like to share with my friends who are currently studying for a doctorate, what preparations they need to make in order to have a higher application rate for this project in the future.
420240	426240	Okay, so today...
426240	428240	Sorry, let me take a look.
428240	436240	So today, Yu-Hsuan will basically answer your questions about the process of applying for the Einstein Project and returning to Taiwan.
436240	440240	In fact, we have another speaker who has also applied for the Einstein Project.
440240	444240	So there should be different opinions, which you can discuss later.
444240	446240	Okay, give me a second.
446800	450800	I just opened a file and turned it off.
450800	456800	Okay, do you have any questions for the speaker about their background?
458800	464800	Is there anything you want to ask or would like to know more about?
466800	468800	Okay, so...
469360	473360	Hey, did you play in the e-sports scene before?
473360	475360	Yes, I did.
475360	477360	I think I know you.
477360	479360	Oh, really?
479360	481360	Yes, yes, yes.
481360	483360	I used to be in the e-sports scene.
483360	485360	I think you played in the e-sports scene for a year or two.
485360	487360	Or was it after Star Cup?
487360	489360	Yes, I played Star Cup for 30 seconds.
489360	491360	Just like Lin Shuhao.
491360	493360	No, no, no.
493360	495360	Impressive, impressive.
495920	497920	Okay, okay, okay.
497920	499920	Let's continue our serious discussion.
499920	501920	Okay.
501920	503920	The person I just talked to is Ted.
503920	507920	He works at Tokyo University as a quantum computer scientist.
507920	511920	Okay, let's get straight to our first question of the day.
511920	515920	I'd like to ask the three speakers to briefly summarize
515920	519920	their journey from starting to studying for a doctorate
519920	521920	to studying for a doctorate.
522480	524480	After finishing the doctorate,
524480	526480	they now work in different jobs.
526480	528480	What are their plans for the future?
528480	530480	What are their thoughts?
530480	532480	And what are the actual changes
532480	534480	that they've encountered?
534480	536480	What is the process like?
536480	538480	Let's change the order.
538480	540480	Why don't we start with Yuxun?
540480	542480	Okay.
542480	544480	Okay.
544480	546480	Because...
546480	548480	Okay.
548480	550480	So...
551040	553040	Um...
553040	555040	Let me share my screen.
559040	561040	Okay.
561040	563040	Can you see my screen?
563040	565040	Yes, I can.
565040	567040	So, basically,
567040	569040	I've already introduced myself
569040	571040	as a student.
571040	573040	So, I won't go into details here.
573040	575040	Um...
575040	577040	I have a passion for science.
577040	579040	But, um...
579600	581600	It's like this quote.
581600	583600	I think the world is full of wonderful things
583600	585600	that you can explore.
585600	587600	But you need to have enough wisdom
587600	589600	to discover them.
589600	591600	This so-called enough wisdom
591600	593600	is actually my personal interpretation.
593600	595600	If you want to do anything,
595600	597600	you have to start over.
597600	599600	That's right.
599600	601600	But you have to know how to do it.
601600	603600	So, why do I say you have to know how to do it?
603600	605600	At the moment,
605600	607600	it's very difficult
608160	610160	to be a researcher.
610160	612160	If you are passionate about research,
612160	614160	your first goal must be teaching.
614160	616160	But, in reality,
616160	618160	I'm not very determined
618160	620160	to be a teacher.
620160	622160	So,
622160	624160	during my studies,
624160	626160	apart from
626160	628160	attending some academic activities,
628160	630160	I also often attend
630160	632160	some vocational lectures
632160	634160	and even some
634160	636160	vocational talks.
636720	638720	At the same time,
638720	640720	I also check out
640720	642720	some talent recruitment websites
642720	644720	like LinkedIn
644720	646720	or 104,
646720	648720	which are often used in Taiwan.
648720	650720	I check out
650720	652720	the relevant knowledge
652720	654720	that I've learned
654720	656720	in the current mainstream companies.
656720	658720	Do they need talents like me?
658720	660720	If they do,
660720	662720	what skills do they need?
662720	664720	So, I occasionally spend some time
665280	667280	learning from them.
667280	669280	Of course,
669280	671280	my life went quite well
671280	673280	as I expected.
673280	675280	So,
675280	677280	when it comes to
677280	679280	interviews in the industry
679280	681280	or
681280	683280	working in the industry,
683280	685280	I can't share too much.
685280	687280	So,
687280	689280	I'll leave this part
689280	691280	to the two of you
691280	693280	to share your experiences.
693840	695840	So,
695840	697840	my major is
697840	699840	nanoradiation
699840	701840	or semiconductor radiation.
701840	703840	So,
703840	705840	for me,
705840	707840	if I want to
707840	709840	become an excellent researcher,
709840	711840	I must have two identities at the same time.
711840	713840	One is a good teacher.
713840	715840	Why should I become a good teacher?
715840	717840	Because I must
717840	719840	take the knowledge
719840	721840	I've learned
722400	724400	and pass it on
724400	726400	to the next
726400	728400	students
728400	730400	or those
730400	732400	who join this field later.
732400	734400	In addition,
734400	736400	I must also be
736400	738400	a good scientist.
738400	740400	If I become a good scientist,
740400	742400	I can get a privilege
742400	744400	that I can know
744400	746400	the secret of the universe
746400	748400	earlier than others.
748400	750400	Then, I can study it thoroughly
750960	752960	and try to manipulate
752960	754960	these physical or scientific phenomena.
754960	756960	I feel excited
756960	758960	about this.
758960	760960	So,
760960	762960	my first goal in life
762960	764960	is to become a researcher.
764960	766960	So, I spend most of my energy
766960	768960	on research.
768960	770960	My goal in life
770960	772960	is to create a good
772960	774960	research environment
774960	776960	for all excellent students
776960	778960	to join my lab
779520	781520	and conduct cutting-edge research.
781520	783520	I want to apply these cutting-edge research
783520	785520	to the world
785520	787520	and the human race.
787520	789520	In other words,
789520	791520	I want to benefit the human race.
791520	793520	It sounds like a lot of nonsense,
793520	795520	but this is what I thought
795520	797520	when I was in high school.
797520	799520	So,
799520	801520	my personal
801520	803520	job search is going well
803520	805520	and I focus on the academic field.
805520	807520	So, let me make it short.
808080	810080	When I was a student,
810080	812080	I focused on
812080	814080	academic development.
814080	816080	So,
816080	818080	I focused on
818080	820080	academic development.
820080	822080	When I was in the lab,
822080	824080	I focused on
824080	826080	receiving awards
826080	828080	such as
828080	830080	a book award
830080	832080	or
832080	834080	a research paper award
834080	836080	or
836640	838640	an engineering degree.
838640	840640	In my field,
840640	842640	I joined SPIE
842640	844640	or IEEE Engineering School.
844640	846640	There are some student awards
846640	848640	on the list.
848640	850640	The advantage of joining these schools
850640	852640	is that you can
852640	854640	participate in some academic activities
854640	856640	and try to apply for some academic awards.
856640	858640	These academic awards
858640	860640	will play a very important role
860640	862640	in your future application
862640	864640	for a postdoc
865200	867200	Besides the academic activities,
867200	869200	don't forget that
869200	871200	as a researcher,
871200	873200	as a scholar,
873200	875200	one of your most important missions
875200	877200	is to pass on knowledge.
877200	879200	As I mentioned in my last PowerPoint,
879200	881200	it is very important to pass on knowledge.
881200	883200	So, during my postdoc
883200	885200	and my PhD,
885200	887200	I spent some of my energy
887200	889200	to train some students
889200	891200	in the Department of University Studies.
891200	893200	Some of the students
893760	895760	in the Department of University Studies
895760	897760	received
897760	899760	some student awards
899760	901760	at some international conferences.
901760	903760	These student awards
903760	905760	are not only their own achievements,
905760	907760	but also
907760	909760	my guidance
909760	911760	to them.
911760	913760	I can't say it is a guidance,
913760	915760	but it is also
915760	917760	a credit for me.
917760	919760	So, I often hear
919760	921760	that some students
922320	924320	spend a lot of time
924320	926320	on their postdocs
926320	928320	or postdocs.
928320	930320	I think
930320	932320	you need to correct
932320	934320	your thoughts
934320	936320	because the students
936320	938320	who receive these awards
938320	940320	prove that
940320	942320	you have the ability
942320	944320	to lead a team
944320	946320	and build a team.
946320	948320	When you write
948320	950320	the Einstein Project,
950880	952880	you have the ability
952880	954880	to build a team.
954880	956880	So, I think
956880	958880	both research and teaching
958880	960880	are very important.
960880	962880	So, I put some effort
962880	964880	into both research
964880	966880	and teaching.
966880	968880	Looking ahead,
968880	970880	what I have done
970880	972880	is meaningful.
972880	974880	These are some of
974880	976880	my thoughts
976880	978880	during my PhD.
979440	981440	I am an academic,
981440	983440	so I can't share
983440	985440	much about the industry.
985440	987440	So, I will end
987440	989440	here.
989440	991440	I feel like I am wasting your time.
991440	993440	No problem.
993440	995440	Thank you.
995440	997440	If you have any questions,
997440	999440	you can type them
999440	1001440	in the chat.
1001440	1003440	We will help you.
1003440	1005440	If you
1005440	1007440	want to say something,
1008000	1010000	remember to turn on the microphone.
1010000	1012000	Some people join later.
1012000	1014000	Next,
1014000	1016000	let's welcome Hao Wei.
1016000	1017440	He is doing a
1017440	1019440	calculation on Fitbit.
1019440	1021440	Hi, everyone.
1021440	1023440	I am Hao Wei.
1023440	1025440	Now,
1025440	1027440	should I introduce
1027440	1029440	my job or
1029440	1031440	what I thought
1031440	1033440	during my PhD?
1033440	1035440	You can start
1035440	1037440	now.
1037440	1039440	How did you
1039440	1041440	decide to
1041440	1043440	choose this path?
1043440	1045440	Did you meet
1045440	1047440	any opportunities?
1047440	1049440	When I
1049440	1051440	started my PhD,
1051440	1053440	I was very happy
1053440	1055440	when I applied to MIT.
1055440	1057440	I thought I got a lottery ticket.
1057440	1059440	But I didn't know
1059440	1061440	how to use it.
1061440	1063440	I asked many professors
1063440	1065440	what I should do
1065440	1067440	to become famous.
1067440	1069440	What kind of professors
1069440	1071440	should I find?
1071440	1073440	A professor told me
1073440	1075440	that the research field
1075440	1077440	has changed a lot.
1077440	1079440	You may not be the most famous
1079440	1081440	when you are studying.
1081440	1083440	You don't need to pursue it.
1083440	1085440	I wanted to continue
1085440	1087440	making videos.
1087440	1089440	But the professor told me
1089440	1091440	I should try new things.
1091440	1093440	I went to
1093440	1095440	study
1095440	1097440	bioengineering.
1099440	1101440	I joined
1101440	1103440	a lab
1103440	1105440	for stem cell
1105440	1107440	microfluidics.
1107440	1109440	My PhD
1109440	1111440	was a struggle.
1111440	1113440	I had to learn
1113440	1115440	new things
1115440	1117440	that I wasn't familiar with.
1117440	1119440	I started to raise cells,
1119440	1121440	kill mice,
1121440	1123440	and other things
1123440	1125440	that I wasn't familiar with.
1125440	1127440	During my PhD,
1127440	1129440	I learned
1129440	1131440	about cross-field research.
1131440	1133440	I learned
1133440	1135440	how to respect professionals
1135440	1137440	and how to learn
1137440	1139440	what they are good at.
1139440	1141440	In our lab,
1141440	1143440	there are chemical engineers,
1143440	1145440	biologists, mechanical engineers,
1145440	1147440	electrical engineers,
1147440	1149440	and scientists.
1149440	1151440	Everyone is different.
1151440	1153440	How can you
1153440	1155440	understand what others are doing?
1155440	1157440	Sometimes you can even
1157440	1159440	talk to them.
1159440	1161440	During my PhD,
1161440	1163440	I was happy
1163440	1165440	to learn
1165440	1167440	different things.
1167440	1169440	During my PhD,
1169440	1171440	there was a postdoc
1171440	1173440	in our lab.
1173440	1175440	He just started
1175440	1177440	his PhD.
1177440	1179440	He did research there.
1179440	1181440	I thought
1181440	1183440	this company was interesting.
1183440	1185440	He thought I was suitable
1185440	1187440	for that company,
1187440	1189440	so I became an intern.
1189440	1191440	If you are not sure
1191440	1193440	whether you want to
1193440	1195440	become a student or an intern,
1195440	1197440	if you have a chance
1197440	1199440	to explore different opportunities,
1199440	1201440	it's different to
1201440	1203440	become an intern.
1203440	1205440	You get to know the industry.
1205440	1207440	After you graduate,
1207440	1209440	your chance to work
1209440	1211440	in the industry
1211440	1213440	will increase.
1213440	1215440	We were lucky
1215440	1217440	to be an intern
1217440	1219440	for three months.
1219440	1221440	It was fun.
1221440	1223440	After I graduated,
1223440	1225440	I went back to the company.
1225440	1227440	As for
1227440	1229440	what I am
1229440	1231440	doing now,
1231440	1233440	there are
1233440	1235440	many people
1235440	1237440	from different fields
1237440	1239440	in our company.
1239440	1241440	We have sleep technologists,
1241440	1243440	exercise physiologists,
1243440	1245440	mechanical and electrical
1245440	1247440	engineers.
1247440	1249440	What I am doing now
1249440	1251440	is a team lead.
1251440	1253440	I handle a big project
1253440	1255440	and finish it together.
1257440	1259440	Yes.
1259440	1261440	I have a question.
1261440	1263440	Where should
1263440	1265440	a student
1265440	1267440	choose to study?
1267440	1269440	Or,
1269440	1271440	where should
1271440	1273440	a student choose
1273440	1275440	to study?
1275440	1277440	For example,
1277440	1279440	what is the relationship
1279440	1281440	between the teacher
1281440	1283440	and the community
1283440	1285440	in the industry?
1285440	1287440	As far as I know,
1287440	1289440	biotechnology
1289440	1291440	is very popular
1291440	1293440	in Boston.
1293440	1295440	That's right.
1295440	1297440	I think it's important.
1297440	1299440	If you want to
1299440	1301440	work in the industry,
1301440	1303440	go to a place with
1303440	1305440	many companies,
1305440	1307440	you can easily
1307440	1309440	get to know
1309440	1311440	what life is like
1311440	1313440	in different companies.
1313440	1315440	In Boston,
1315440	1317440	we have
1317440	1319440	a BTBA organization.
1319440	1321440	We are all Taiwanese
1321440	1323440	and have a BTBA association.
1323440	1325440	Many people
1325440	1327440	work there.
1327440	1329440	We have an annual conference
1329440	1331440	to share what we are doing.
1331440	1333440	I think it's important
1333440	1335440	to choose a place.
1335440	1337440	If you are a professor,
1337440	1339440	you can ask
1339440	1341440	other professors
1341440	1343440	or people
1343440	1345440	in the lab,
1345440	1347440	even foreigners,
1347440	1349440	to grab a coffee
1349440	1351440	and chat
1351440	1353440	about their
1353440	1355440	views.
1355440	1357440	Thank you.
1357440	1359440	Let me see if there are any questions.
1363440	1365440	Let's finish
1365440	1367440	our talk.
1367440	1369440	We have a question
1369440	1371440	for Yuxun.
1371440	1373440	Let's hear from
1373440	1375440	Mujie.
1375440	1377440	Okay.
1377440	1379440	I'm like Yuxun.
1379440	1381440	When I was young,
1381440	1383440	I wanted to
1383440	1385440	become a scientist.
1385440	1387440	I didn't know
1387440	1389440	what I wanted to do.
1389440	1391440	I decided to study chemistry
1391440	1393440	when I was in high school.
1393440	1395440	At that time,
1395440	1397440	I found chemistry interesting.
1397440	1399440	So I chose chemistry.
1399440	1401440	I kept studying.
1403440	1405440	I was different from
1405440	1407440	most people.
1407440	1409440	I decided to study
1409440	1411440	in the Netherlands.
1411440	1413440	Most people
1413440	1415440	went to the U.S. or the U.K.
1415440	1417440	Before I went abroad,
1417440	1419440	I asked
1419440	1421440	my teacher
1421440	1423440	if I wanted to
1423440	1425440	go back to Taiwan
1425440	1427440	to be a professor.
1427440	1429440	If I went to the Netherlands,
1429440	1431440	would it affect me?
1431440	1433440	If you google the name of the university,
1433440	1435440	it's not
1435440	1437440	the top university in the world.
1439440	1441440	My boss told me
1441440	1443440	that if you really
1443440	1445440	want to get a job,
1445440	1447440	your name is not that important.
1447440	1449440	What's important is
1449440	1451440	what you got
1451440	1453440	in the course of studying.
1453440	1455440	Did you prepare yourself well?
1455440	1457440	It's like
1457440	1459440	what you said earlier.
1459440	1461440	You need to know
1461440	1463440	where you want to go
1463440	1465440	and
1465440	1467440	prepare yourself well.
1469440	1471440	So I went to the Netherlands
1471440	1473440	to study.
1473440	1475440	When I was in the Netherlands,
1475440	1477440	it was interesting.
1477440	1479440	You mentioned
1479440	1481440	joining a lab.
1481440	1483440	It was a new lab.
1483440	1485440	I was the first
1485440	1487440	PhD student
1487440	1489440	of my boss.
1491440	1493440	I learned
1493440	1495440	how to build up
1495440	1497440	your lab
1497440	1499440	from a young faculty.
1499440	1501440	After I graduated
1501440	1503440	from my PhD,
1503440	1505440	I joined a new lab
1505440	1507440	and was the first
1507440	1509440	PhD student of my boss.
1511440	1513440	I didn't choose
1513440	1515440	these places on purpose.
1515440	1517440	Of course,
1517440	1519440	I had some considerations.
1519440	1521440	I think you need to
1521440	1523440	pay attention to your personality.
1523440	1525440	You like to stay in the city
1525440	1527440	or go to
1527440	1529440	university-like places.
1529440	1531440	I think this
1531440	1533440	will affect
1533440	1535440	your daily life.
1535440	1537440	I like to go to
1537440	1539440	less crowded places.
1539440	1541440	So I chose these places.
1541440	1543440	Although Chicago
1543440	1545440	is a big city,
1545440	1547440	it's a bit helpless
1547440	1549440	because as a
1549440	1551440	PhD student in Europe,
1551440	1553440	it's relatively difficult
1553440	1555440	to find a postdoc in the US.
1555440	1557440	Your boss doesn't help you much
1557440	1559440	because he only knows people in Europe.
1559440	1561440	He rarely knows people in the US.
1561440	1563440	At that time,
1563440	1565440	I flew from
1565440	1567440	Europe and the Netherlands
1567440	1569440	to the US for conferences
1569440	1571440	to meet some young
1571440	1573440	PIs.
1573440	1575440	I took a few interviews
1575440	1577440	and went to
1577440	1579440	those PIs.
1579440	1581440	He mentioned that
1581440	1583440	he had a position
1583440	1585440	and I went to
1585440	1587440	talk to him.
1587440	1589440	Although I didn't
1589440	1591440	talk to him,
1591440	1593440	it's because of
1593440	1595440	other financial reasons.
1595440	1597440	I think
1597440	1599440	sometimes
1599440	1601440	you don't have
1601440	1603440	many choices.
1603440	1605440	So you have to
1605440	1607440	be prepared.
1607440	1609440	If it's not your first choice,
1609440	1611440	what will be your second
1611440	1613440	or third choice?
1613440	1615440	This is
1615440	1617440	my overall
1617440	1619440	opinion.
1619440	1621440	Let's see if
1621440	1623440	there's anything else you want to know.
1625440	1627440	Thank you, Mu Jie.
1627440	1629440	We actually have a lot of questions
1629440	1631440	and the questions came out
1631440	1633440	faster than we can digest.
1633440	1635440	Some of them
1635440	1637440	are about
1637440	1639440	things to discuss later.
1639440	1641440	Let's ask a question first.
1641440	1643440	Chen Yixuan
1643440	1645440	wants to ask Yuxun.
1645440	1647440	During your Ph.D.
1647440	1649440	and looking for a job,
1649440	1651440	did you ever want to give up or
1651440	1653440	change your career?
1653440	1655440	How did you
1655440	1657440	change your mind?
1659440	1661440	Of course.
1661440	1663440	This can be divided into
1663440	1665440	two parts.
1665440	1667440	One is an internal question
1667440	1669440	and the other is an external question.
1669440	1671440	The internal question is
1671440	1673440	when I was in my
1673440	1675440	fourth year of Ph.D.,
1675440	1677440	I had my own paper.
1677440	1679440	Before that, I didn't even have
1679440	1681440	a second author's paper.
1681440	1683440	In the process,
1683440	1685440	I thought
1685440	1687440	if I was not
1687440	1689440	suitable for
1689440	1691440	academia.
1691440	1693440	In academia,
1693440	1695440	you need to have enough research
1695440	1697440	to be able to
1697440	1699440	continue.
1699440	1701440	This is the internal part.
1701440	1703440	The external part is
1703440	1705440	when I was in my
1705440	1707440	fourth year of Ph.D.,
1707440	1709440	I went to work
1709440	1711440	at a tai chi shop.
1711440	1713440	Although I
1713440	1715440	saw them complaining about
1715440	1717440	their busy schedule,
1717440	1719440	I saw them buy a car,
1719440	1721440	buy a house, get married,
1721440	1723440	and have kids.
1723440	1725440	Even my high school
1725440	1727440	graduates
1727440	1729440	bought a car
1729440	1731440	and bought a house
1731440	1733440	and had kids.
1733440	1735440	I wondered
1735440	1737440	if I was mentally ill
1737440	1739440	and wanted to take this path.
1739440	1741440	Of course, there were times
1741440	1743440	when I wanted to give up.
1743440	1745440	Every time
1745440	1747440	I wanted to give up,
1747440	1749440	I wanted to try again.
1749440	1751440	Your life is only once.
1751440	1753440	If you don't try,
1753440	1755440	if you don't push your limits,
1755440	1757440	you will never know
1757440	1759440	how far you can go.
1759440	1761440	I was trying
1761440	1763440	as much as I could.
1763440	1765440	On the other hand,
1765440	1767440	I am very grateful
1767440	1769440	to my family and friends
1769440	1771440	for their help.
1771440	1773440	I don't have any financial
1773440	1775440	difficulties.
1775440	1777440	To be honest,
1777440	1779440	I don't have any financial difficulties.
1779440	1781440	Compared to other Ph.D. students
1781440	1783440	I know,
1783440	1785440	I am relatively lucky.
1785440	1787440	I am lucky
1787440	1789440	because
1789440	1791440	I know some people
1791440	1793440	who are not so lucky.
1793440	1795440	They've made it
1795440	1797440	and survived.
1797440	1799440	It's a great motivation
1799440	1801440	to me.
1801440	1803440	They've made it
1803440	1805440	and survived.
1805440	1807440	It's a great motivation
1807440	1809440	to me.
1809440	1811440	It's a great motivation
1811440	1813440	to me.
1813440	1815440	So I will spend
1815440	1817440	my days
1817440	1819440	thinking about
1819440	1821440	these three things.
1821440	1823440	I will hang out
1823440	1825440	with my friends
1825440	1827440	and chat a lot,
1827440	1829440	or take a walk
1829440	1831440	and listen to
1831440	1833440	other people's stories
1833440	1835440	in lectures.
1835440	1837440	I even go to
1837440	1839440	bookstores
1839440	1841440	to see how
1841440	1843440	some of the
1843440	1845440	drugs are good
1845440	1847440	depending on how you use them.
1847440	1849440	Sometimes you need
1849440	1851440	positive energy
1851440	1853440	to support you.
1853440	1855440	This is my answer to this question.
1855440	1857440	Very positive.
1857440	1859440	Thank you.
1861440	1863440	Our next question
1863440	1865440	is related to
1865440	1867440	some of the questions
1867440	1869440	that have been raised.
1869440	1871440	For example,
1871440	1873440	if you want to go to the industry
1873440	1875440	but have not done an internship,
1875440	1877440	do you need to do postdocs
1877440	1879440	before going to the industry?
1879440	1881440	Another question is
1881440	1883440	if you have studied for many years
1883440	1885440	and want to transition to
1885440	1887440	the industry,
1887440	1889440	will there be a deduction?
1889440	1891440	Our next question
1891440	1893440	is to ask
1893440	1895440	how the academic research
1895440	1897440	can help you
1897440	1899440	and the advantages and disadvantages.
1899440	1901440	Can you give us a general analysis?
1901440	1903440	Let's sum up these questions
1903440	1905440	and let Haowei answer them.
1905440	1907440	Okay, no problem.
1907440	1909440	I think
1909440	1911440	the first question
1911440	1913440	is
1913440	1915440	whether you need to
1915440	1917440	do postdocs
1917440	1919440	before going to work.
1919440	1921440	Postdocs is a time for relaxation.
1921440	1923440	If you want to go to the industry,
1923440	1925440	you can find a new city
1925440	1927440	or an interesting topic.
1927440	1929440	That topic is very needed
1929440	1931440	in the industry now.
1931440	1933440	It is a good opportunity
1933440	1935440	to be a jump board.
1935440	1937440	If not, it's okay.
1937440	1939440	If you have not done postdocs,
1939440	1941440	if you can find
1941440	1943440	a similar job,
1943440	1945440	it's good.
1945440	1947440	But in fact,
1947440	1949440	if you want to apply
1949440	1951440	what you learned in PhD
1951440	1953440	to the industry,
1953440	1955440	for me,
1955440	1957440	what I learned
1957440	1959440	in PhD is
1959440	1961440	soft skills.
1961440	1963440	How to make a presentation,
1963440	1965440	how to
1965440	1967440	do a literature search,
1967440	1969440	how to
1969440	1971440	present your idea to others.
1971440	1973440	I think these soft skills
1973440	1975440	are more important.
1975440	1977440	As for
1977440	1979440	hard skills,
1979440	1981440	it depends on
1981440	1983440	whether there are elements
1983440	1985440	in the topic of PhD.
1985440	1987440	For example,
1987440	1989440	you can talk to your friends
1989440	1991440	in the industry
1991440	1993440	about which skills
1993440	1995440	the industry needs.
1995440	1997440	When the industry is looking for talents,
1997440	1999440	it depends on your experience
1999440	2001440	and your skill set.
2001440	2003440	There are two ways
2003440	2005440	when the industry is looking for talents.
2005440	2007440	One is fresh grad.
2007440	2009440	I take you in and train you again.
2009440	2011440	It depends on
2011440	2013440	your experience.
2013440	2015440	It depends on your luck.
2017440	2019440	Any other questions?
2023440	2025440	I'm curious about
2025440	2027440	a similar question.
2027440	2029440	When did you
2029440	2031440	start to want to work in the industry?
2031440	2033440	Did you do the internship
2033440	2035440	because you wanted to work in the industry?
2035440	2037440	Did you decide
2037440	2039440	to go this way
2039440	2041440	after the internship?
2041440	2043440	Or did you decide
2043440	2045440	to go this way
2045440	2047440	after the internship?
2053440	2055440	I'm more interested
2055440	2057440	in the industry.
2061440	2063440	First,
2063440	2065440	I don't like to write papers.
2065440	2067440	I think
2067440	2069440	it's a waste of time
2069440	2071440	to write papers.
2071440	2073440	I want to do something
2073440	2075440	that makes me feel
2075440	2077440	accomplished.
2077440	2079440	I started to work in the industry
2079440	2081440	in my third or fourth year.
2081440	2083440	After I saw
2083440	2085440	the algorithm,
2085440	2087440	millions of people
2087440	2089440	were using it.
2089440	2091440	I felt accomplished.
2091440	2093440	Any other questions?
2097440	2099440	Besides
2099440	2101440	hiring people in the industry,
2101440	2103440	are you interested in
2103440	2105440	starting your own business
2105440	2107440	or starting a new company?
2109440	2111440	In Boston,
2111440	2113440	the start-up culture
2113440	2115440	is very strong.
2115440	2117440	I'm a member
2117440	2119440	of the Yushan Technology Association.
2119440	2121440	We advocate
2121440	2123440	start-ups
2123440	2125440	and resources
2125440	2127440	to hold events
2127440	2129440	to add these things.
2129440	2131440	We have investors
2131440	2133440	who fund us.
2133440	2135440	We have entrepreneurs
2135440	2137440	who have started a business.
2137440	2139440	We have local
2139440	2141440	technology scientists.
2141440	2143440	We have these resources.
2143440	2145440	We hold events every year
2145440	2147440	to see if we can create something new.
2147440	2149440	I have a friend
2149440	2151440	who is a doctor.
2151440	2153440	He also started a company
2153440	2155440	in Taiwan.
2155440	2157440	He does AI and healthcare.
2157440	2159440	I might
2159440	2161440	be interested in
2161440	2163440	starting a start-up company
2163440	2165440	after a while.
2165440	2167440	I might give it a try.
2169440	2171440	You may not know.
2171440	2173440	I just asked this question.
2173440	2175440	Hao Wei
2175440	2177440	is very active
2177440	2179440	in Taiwan's industry
2179440	2181440	and start-up organizations
2181440	2183440	and clubs.
2183440	2185440	If you have any questions,
2185440	2187440	you can contact him
2187440	2189440	to discuss or collaborate.
2191440	2193440	Can you hear me?
2193440	2195440	Yes.
2195440	2197440	I'm Yiting.
2197440	2199440	Yanyong asked a lot of questions.
2199440	2201440	Can I go back
2201440	2203440	and ask more?
2203440	2205440	Sure.
2205440	2207440	He asked
2207440	2209440	if you need to
2209440	2211440	be a postdoc.
2211440	2213440	He also asked
2213440	2215440	if you want to
2215440	2217440	become an intern
2217440	2219440	after completing
2219440	2221440	a PhD.
2221440	2223440	He also asked
2223440	2225440	if you want to
2225440	2227440	become a postdoc
2227440	2229440	after completing
2229440	2231440	a PhD.
2231440	2233440	I'm curious.
2233440	2235440	Can you share
2235440	2237440	your thoughts?
2239440	2241440	Hi.
2241440	2243440	This question
2243440	2245440	is very specific.
2245440	2247440	It's easy to find a job
2247440	2249440	in electronics.
2249440	2251440	But it's not easy
2251440	2253440	to find a job
2253440	2255440	in bio.
2255440	2257440	Most people
2257440	2259440	can't find a job
2259440	2261440	after completing
2261440	2263440	a postdoc.
2263440	2265440	I think
2265440	2267440	it's important
2267440	2269440	to ask people
2269440	2271440	in the same field
2271440	2273440	how to use
2273440	2275440	their skills
2275440	2277440	in the industry.
2277440	2279440	Thank you.
2281440	2283440	Yiting is in Europe, right?
2283440	2285440	Yes.
2285440	2287440	I'm in Switzerland.
2287440	2289440	You're a world-famous person.
2289440	2291440	Yes.
2291440	2293440	Today is a special day.
2293440	2295440	It's not a regular day.
2295440	2297440	I can participate.
2297440	2299440	We're usually
2299440	2301440	in North America.
2301440	2303440	It's a suitable day for us.
2303440	2305440	But it's a world-famous day.
2305440	2307440	Okay.
2307440	2309440	Mu Jie
2309440	2311440	said something
2311440	2313440	interesting.
2313440	2315440	Let me ask you.
2315440	2317440	I think Mu Jie
2317440	2319440	is an expert
2319440	2321440	who works with young professors.
2321440	2323440	He works with young professors
2323440	2325440	at every stage.
2325440	2327440	He's a young boss now.
2327440	2329440	Can you share
2329440	2331440	with us
2331440	2333440	if you're worried
2333440	2335440	that it's hard
2335440	2337440	to find a job
2337440	2339440	with a young boss
2339440	2341440	or a boss
2341440	2343440	who's not
2343440	2345440	as good as Mu Jie?
2345440	2347440	Do you have any
2347440	2349440	suggestions
2349440	2351440	for young people
2351440	2353440	who want to work with young bosses?
2353440	2355440	I think
2355440	2357440	it's very risky
2357440	2359440	to work with young bosses.
2359440	2361440	You don't know
2361440	2363440	their past records.
2363440	2365440	You can only check
2365440	2367440	their past publications.
2367440	2369440	It's risky.
2369440	2371440	But
2371440	2373440	another advantage of young professors
2373440	2375440	is that
2375440	2377440	you can be sure
2377440	2379440	they won't fail.
2379440	2381440	After all,
2381440	2383440	they're under pressure.
2383440	2385440	So you can be sure
2385440	2387440	they won't fail.
2387440	2389440	If you meet a young boss
2389440	2391440	who's not as good as you,
2391440	2393440	you can
2393440	2395440	leave
2395440	2397440	after a few years.
2397440	2399440	Because
2399440	2401440	even if
2401440	2403440	your boss is very influential,
2403440	2405440	to a certain extent,
2405440	2407440	if he's
2407440	2409440	very influential
2409440	2411440	and helps you
2411440	2413440	make progress,
2413440	2415440	to a certain extent,
2415440	2417440	you'll be influenced by him.
2417440	2419440	If he's a good boss,
2419440	2421440	I don't think it's a problem.
2421440	2423440	If he's not a good boss,
2423440	2425440	he might help you
2425440	2427440	find a job.
2427440	2429440	He might start to tell you
2429440	2431440	or suggest you
2431440	2433440	that he helped you
2433440	2435440	and you should help him.
2435440	2437440	It's hard to say no.
2437440	2439440	Another idea
2439440	2441440	is to
2441440	2443440	take a risk with them.
2443440	2445440	It's a high-risk, high-reward.
2445440	2447440	I had this idea
2447440	2449440	when I was young.
2449440	2451440	You work with young professors.
2451440	2453440	When they become famous,
2453440	2455440	you're still a student.
2455440	2457440	When they become influential,
2457440	2459440	you're still a student.
2459440	2461440	But if you work with an old professor,
2461440	2463440	who will help you after he's gone?
2463440	2465440	It's a similar idea.
2465440	2467440	So I think
2467440	2469440	young professors
2469440	2471440	are at risk.
2471440	2473440	When I was making these choices,
2475440	2477440	I interviewed
2477440	2479440	those bosses.
2479440	2481440	You have to talk to them.
2481440	2483440	You have to know
2483440	2485440	what they expect you to do.
2485440	2487440	I think
2487440	2489440	it was special at the beginning.
2489440	2491440	In the Netherlands,
2491440	2493440	you interview
2493440	2495440	the boss.
2495440	2497440	He'll give you
2497440	2499440	a clear question
2499440	2501440	about what you should do.
2501440	2503440	Before I left,
2503440	2505440	I knew
2505440	2507440	what kind of personality
2507440	2509440	my future boss would have
2509440	2511440	and what kind of question
2511440	2513440	I should ask.
2513440	2515440	So I knew
2515440	2517440	I could start working
2517440	2519440	right away.
2519440	2521440	As for POSA,
2521440	2523440	I thought
2523440	2525440	I could get along
2525440	2527440	with them.
2527440	2529440	So
2529440	2531440	I decided
2531440	2533440	to go to POSA.
2533440	2535440	Another reason
2535440	2537440	I went to POSA
2537440	2539440	is that
2539440	2541440	I didn't want to
2541440	2543440	wait too long
2543440	2545440	to get a job there.
2545440	2547440	So that was
2547440	2549440	the only offer I had.
2549440	2551440	I asked
2551440	2553440	my college classmate
2553440	2555440	in the US.
2555440	2557440	I asked him
2557440	2559440	how to get a job at POSA.
2559440	2561440	He said young professors
2561440	2563440	usually have those positions.
2563440	2565440	Young professors
2565440	2567440	just got here,
2567440	2569440	so they must have
2569440	2571440	a few POSA positions.
2571440	2573440	So they must have them.
2573440	2575440	If you go to
2575440	2577440	well-known labs,
2577440	2579440	they can't help you.
2579440	2581440	They might have a POSA position,
2581440	2583440	but half a year ago,
2583440	2585440	it was booked.
2585440	2587440	So you can't find it.
2587440	2589440	So you have to
2589440	2591440	beg for a POSA.
2591440	2593440	So I think
2593440	2595440	it's not the same.
2595440	2597440	The most important thing is
2597440	2599440	to select your boss.
2599440	2601440	At least talk to him.
2601440	2603440	Don't just follow him.
2603440	2605440	Then decide
2605440	2607440	the next few days.
2607440	2609440	Another important thing
2609440	2611440	is if you don't think
2611440	2613440	it's suitable,
2613440	2615440	leave early.
2615440	2617440	Be brave and say no.
2617440	2619440	Give up earlier
2619440	2621440	is better than
2621440	2623440	giving up later.
2623440	2625440	Because
2625440	2627440	when you get to
2627440	2629440	the level of POSA,
2629440	2631440	at least some people
2631440	2633440	have families
2633440	2635440	or a stable partner.
2635440	2637440	If you're not
2637440	2639440	in a good mood,
2639440	2641440	it will affect more people,
2641440	2643440	not just you.
2643440	2645440	So that's about it.
2645440	2647440	Okay.
2647440	2649440	Did anyone
2649440	2651440	want to ask a question?
2651440	2653440	Do you want to apply for a doctorate in the Netherlands?
2653440	2655440	Yes. Let's expand
2655440	2657440	this question.
2657440	2659440	Why did you want to apply?
2659440	2661440	For example, the Netherlands.
2661440	2663440	Did you only apply for the Netherlands?
2663440	2665440	Or did you apply to other European countries?
2665440	2667440	At that time,
2667440	2669440	the situation was like this.
2669440	2671440	The application in the Netherlands was different.
2671440	2673440	It's not like the United States or Taiwan.
2673440	2675440	You have to apply at a fixed time every year.
2675440	2677440	Because every year,
2677440	2679440	you have to submit something
2679440	2681440	The doctor in the Netherlands
2681440	2683440	is very similar to what I just said.
2683440	2685440	Because it's a very specific topic.
2685440	2687440	So it's actually the boss's
2687440	2689440	application plan.
2689440	2691440	Then he will get a doctorate position.
2691440	2693440	When he gets this doctorate position,
2693440	2695440	he will advertise it.
2695440	2697440	So basically, you can apply all year round.
2697440	2699440	The point is whether the boss has received the money or not.
2699440	2701440	So he can apply all year round.
2701440	2703440	So he has
2703440	2705440	a lot of free time.
2705440	2707440	At that time,
2707440	2709440	I was preparing for the application in the United States.
2709440	2711440	But it just so happens that
2711440	2713440	there was a student in our department
2713440	2715440	who was studying for a doctorate in the Netherlands.
2715440	2717440	He said that there was a new teacher
2717440	2719440	in their school and there were several positions.
2719440	2721440	Then I saw the topic and thought it was quite interesting.
2721440	2723440	So I made an appointment with the teacher.
2723440	2725440	This interview was actually before
2725440	2727440	I sent out the application in the United States.
2727440	2729440	After the interview,
2729440	2731440	the boss
2731440	2733440	was willing to give me a position.
2733440	2735440	So I didn't apply to the United States at the end.
2735440	2737440	Oh, you didn't apply at all?
2737440	2739440	I had everything ready.
2739440	2741440	I was actually going to send it out.
2741440	2743440	Because I told him that
2743440	2745440	I asked him when he would give me a reply.
2745440	2747440	Then he gave me a time.
2747440	2749440	Because I told him that if he gave me a reply,
2749440	2751440	I would go if he was willing to.
2751440	2753440	Then I would stop all the applications in the United States.
2753440	2755440	So I was willing to do this at that time.
2755440	2757440	Just go.
2757440	2759440	So if you want to apply for a doctorate in Europe,
2759440	2761440	most of the time
2761440	2763440	you have to take the initiative to look at
2763440	2765440	all the teachers' websites
2765440	2767440	or all the schools'
2767440	2769440	HR websites.
2769440	2771440	Then there will be some positions on it.
2771440	2773440	Yes.
2773440	2775440	So like this,
2775440	2777440	because you have a classmate
2777440	2779440	or a junior who knows this information,
2779440	2781440	but you just said
2781440	2783440	most of them will directly post
2783440	2785440	information like this
2785440	2787440	talent or real person.
2787440	2789440	Is it the same as
2789440	2791440	applying for a doctorate
2791440	2793440	in the Netherlands?
2793440	2795440	Or where can you find this information?
2795440	2797440	At least I'm sure it's on the same platform
2797440	2799440	in the Netherlands.
2799440	2801440	Because it's really
2801440	2803440	like going to a company to find a job.
2803440	2805440	It's a bit like
2805440	2807440	going to a company's
2807440	2809440	website's HR section.
2809440	2811440	Then it will list all the positions.
2811440	2813440	So it will list
2813440	2815440	that it may have a faculty position
2815440	2817440	or a Ph.D. position.
2817440	2819440	So it's actually found here.
2819440	2821440	I forgot to mention that
2821440	2823440	the reason why I chose the Netherlands
2823440	2825440	is because when I was in the university,
2825440	2827440	my teacher
2827440	2829440	asked me to go to the Netherlands
2829440	2831440	for a meeting.
2831440	2833440	So I went there for some exchange activities.
2833440	2835440	I had a good impression of the Netherlands.
2835440	2837440	So I decided to go to the Netherlands.
2837440	2839440	Someone asked
2839440	2841440	how competitive it was.
2841440	2843440	Actually, it was very competitive.
2845440	2847440	Yes, it was really competitive.
2847440	2849440	Yes, but I think
2849440	2851440	actually...
2851440	2853440	I'm sorry.
2853440	2855440	Actually, finding a faculty position
2855440	2857440	is...
2857440	2859440	I think people often have a misunderstanding.
2859440	2861440	It's like someone is very good
2861440	2863440	but he didn't get a faculty position.
2863440	2865440	I think this is very strange.
2865440	2867440	But actually it's not like that.
2867440	2869440	The reason is
2869440	2871440	you have to look at
2871440	2873440	what kind of person
2873440	2875440	your target department
2875440	2877440	is.
2877440	2879440	For example, in the field of chemistry,
2879440	2881440	I'm just saying.
2881440	2883440	It's not that our department is looking for it now.
2883440	2885440	Let's say our department wants to find
2885440	2887440	an organic chemistry person.
2887440	2889440	You apply for a person
2889440	2891440	who is super good at physics and chemistry.
2891440	2893440	Basically, his chances are very small.
2893440	2895440	Yes, the reason is
2895440	2897440	that we don't have that shortage
2897440	2899440	in physics and chemistry now.
2899440	2901440	Because I often find faculty
2901440	2903440	to satisfy
2903440	2905440	their expectations
2905440	2907440	for teaching in the future.
2907440	2909440	Yes, so I think
2909440	2911440	don't be too self-absorbed.
2911440	2913440	Why do you think the person
2913440	2915440	who applied is worse than me?
2915440	2917440	Why can he still go?
2917440	2919440	But it's mainly
2919440	2921440	because of this reason.
2921440	2923440	Especially if you are
2923440	2925440	going to a more advanced school.
2925440	2927440	Yes, and sometimes
2927440	2929440	because
2929440	2931440	the direction you are going
2931440	2933440	is that there is a young teacher
2933440	2935440	or there are already a lot of people
2935440	2937440	doing this direction,
2937440	2939440	so you can't get into that department.
2939440	2941440	Yes, so it's often...
2941440	2943440	So part of the competition
2943440	2945440	is actually here.
2945440	2947440	And this is actually
2947440	2949440	a place you can't control yourself.
2949440	2951440	So I often say that
2951440	2953440	sometimes when you are looking for a teacher,
2953440	2955440	you actually need to ask
2955440	2957440	your former teacher
2957440	2959440	about it,
2959440	2961440	which direction this time
2961440	2963440	he wants to go.
2963440	2965440	Yes, so that's probably it.
2965440	2967440	In fact,
2967440	2969440	if you want to lose postdoc,
2969440	2971440	no, sorry, you want to lose the faculty position,
2971440	2973440	this department
2973440	2975440	has a very important
2975440	2977440	future plan for its own research.
2977440	2979440	But how high do you think the opportunity is
2979440	2981440	that you can use
2981440	2983440	what you are good at to break it?
2983440	2985440	For example, they wanted to find a light school,
2985440	2987440	but you are, for example,
2987440	2989440	super strong, so strong that you can
2989440	2991440	make them rather give up or
2991440	2993440	re-adjust their future plan.
2993440	2995440	Or is this basically impossible to happen?
2995440	2997440	This is definitely possible to happen.
2997440	2999440	This is definitely possible to happen.
2999440	3001440	Because if you go to a
3001440	3003440	research-focused school,
3003440	3005440	the chance of this happening will be higher.
3005440	3007440	Yes, but it will become
3007440	3009440	an extra person
3009440	3011440	to help you.
3011440	3013440	Yes, but
3013440	3015440	another problem is that
3015440	3017440	in Taiwan, faculty positions
3017440	3019440	are actually limited.
3019440	3021440	So if you happen to
3021440	3023440	meet a faculty today,
3023440	3025440	there is only one person left.
3025440	3027440	Then the difficulty will increase a lot.
3027440	3029440	Because after he hired you,
3029440	3031440	even if you are very good,
3031440	3033440	what about the gap in teaching
3033440	3035440	in the next two years?
3035440	3037440	So there will be this.
3037440	3039440	There may also be such a situation.
3039440	3041440	So like I said,
3041440	3043440	it's actually very important to find
3043440	3045440	someone who can help you.
3045440	3047440	Because they will also know
3047440	3049440	if there is a way to
3049440	3051440	argue with the school for some positions.
3051440	3053440	Because in fact, these can all be discussed.
3053440	3055440	How good you are actually depends on
3055440	3057440	how much the department is willing to help you.
3057440	3059440	Yes, if you are really super strong.
3059440	3061440	Suppose you are
3061440	3063440	in Caltech today and
3063440	3065440	you are an assistant professor
3065440	3067440	and you are willing to come back to Taiwan.
3067440	3069440	Then I think the space that will be willing to help you
3069440	3071440	is already much bigger.
3071440	3073440	This will definitely be a big news.
3073440	3075440	But this is just an exaggerated example.
3075440	3077440	But what I mean is that
3077440	3079440	the more powerful you are,
3079440	3081440	the more willing to help you.
3081440	3083440	So even if you find out
3083440	3085440	that it is not your own field,
3085440	3087440	but you will still encourage you to apply.
3087440	3089440	You just don't have to
3089440	3091440	do it because you have it or not.
3091440	3093440	Yes, yes, yes.
3093440	3095440	OK, now that we have talked about
3095440	3097440	looking for this job,
3097440	3099440	this academia job.
3099440	3101440	In fact, we have arranged
3101440	3103440	a very good video
3103440	3105440	prepared by Yuxun.
3105440	3107440	You can tell us about
3107440	3109440	his application,
3109440	3111440	such as Price Postdoc Fellowship
3111440	3113440	and independent research funding.
3113440	3115440	They all applied for this
3115440	3117440	Einstein project.
3117440	3119440	Otherwise, let's invite Yuxun
3119440	3121440	to share his video now.
3121440	3123440	OK, no problem.
3123440	3125440	Can you see it now?
3125440	3127440	I just saw it,
3127440	3129440	but I can't see it now.
3129440	3131440	Can you see it now?
3131440	3133440	Yes, yes.
3133440	3135440	OK,
3135440	3137440	because of the limited time,
3137440	3139440	I will directly cut to the point.
3139440	3141440	OK, so here you can see
3141440	3143440	the review key points
3143440	3145440	of the Einstein project.
3145440	3147440	It includes the applicant's
3147440	3149440	ambition,
3149440	3151440	and then your research
3151440	3153440	topic,
3153440	3155440	how important it is to society,
3155440	3157440	what kind of contribution it makes to society,
3157440	3159440	and how to train the research team.
3159440	3161440	The Columbus project is basically
3161440	3163440	the same as the Einstein project.
3163440	3165440	It just has one more
3165440	3167440	international cooperation experience
3167440	3169440	and an important plan
3169440	3171440	to serve the International Academy of Sciences.
3171440	3173440	So let's talk about
3173440	3175440	it one by one.
3175440	3177440	When you apply for this project,
3177440	3179440	what kind of preparation
3179440	3181440	do you need to do?
3189440	3191440	Hello.
3191440	3193440	OK, so basically
3193440	3195440	the above review key points
3195440	3197440	are a bit confusing, right?
3197440	3199440	First of all,
3199440	3201440	the most important thing
3201440	3203440	is your
3203440	3205440	first item.
3205440	3207440	The first item is to ask
3207440	3209440	the applicant
3209440	3211440	how important
3211440	3213440	the project is
3213440	3215440	and how long
3215440	3217440	it will last.
3217440	3219440	So you have to
3219440	3221440	try to describe
3221440	3223440	how important
3223440	3225440	and how long
3225440	3227440	your project is
3227440	3229440	in your plan.
3229440	3231440	Because the plan review
3231440	3233440	is one of the review opinions
3233440	3235440	that applicants often encounter.
3235440	3237440	But the applicant is not an expert
3237440	3239440	in this area.
3239440	3241440	So when you write
3241440	3243440	the background of the study,
3243440	3245440	you have to focus on
3245440	3247440	some key points.
3247440	3249440	For example,
3249440	3251440	how to get the reviewer
3251440	3253440	to catch
3253440	3255440	your point
3255440	3257440	quickly.
3257440	3259440	So
3259440	3261440	I think
3261440	3263440	there is a very good
3263440	3265440	way to get
3265440	3267440	the reviewer to catch
3267440	3269440	your point
3269440	3271440	quickly.
3271440	3273440	You can ask
3273440	3275440	some friends
3275440	3277440	who are not in the field
3277440	3279440	to introduce
3279440	3281440	the background of
3281440	3283440	your study.
3283440	3285440	Because they are not in the field,
3285440	3287440	they will know
3287440	3289440	where the blind spot is.
3289440	3291440	They will tell you
3291440	3293440	when you apply,
3293440	3295440	they will tell you
3295440	3297440	your study is
3297440	3299440	application type,
3299440	3301440	orientation type,
3301440	3303440	or basic research type.
3303440	3305440	These are the three types.
3305440	3307440	So when you apply,
3307440	3309440	if you are
3309440	3311440	basic research type,
3311440	3313440	it's basically like this picture.
3313440	3315440	The person on your right
3315440	3317440	wants to cross the river to the other side.
3317440	3319440	For a mathematician,
3319440	3321440	if you are a smart mathematician,
3321440	3323440	you basically
3323440	3325440	shrink the whole two-dimensional plane
3325440	3327440	into a point.
3327440	3329440	You fold it over,
3329440	3331440	and the person can jump over the river.
3331440	3333440	So this is called theoretical research.
3333440	3335440	In other words,
3335440	3337440	it has nothing to do with application.
3337440	3339440	It is a more basic research.
3339440	3341440	For example,
3341440	3343440	if you want to study
3343440	3345440	in another field,
3345440	3347440	if you want to study
3347440	3349440	where the gap is between
3349440	3351440	basic research and
3351440	3353440	basic research,
3353440	3355440	it may not be able to
3355440	3357440	apply immediately.
3357440	3359440	What is application type research?
3359440	3361440	Basically,
3361440	3363440	what kind of problem do you want to overcome
3363440	3365440	if you want to cross the river?
3365440	3367440	How do you build a bridge?
3367440	3369440	If you build a bridge,
3369440	3371440	what kind of earthquake
3371440	3373440	can it withstand?
3373440	3375440	This is called application type research.
3375440	3377440	Based on application type
3377440	3379440	and basic research,
3379440	3381440	it is basically like this picture.
3381440	3383440	You feel like there is something
3383440	3385440	that can be done,
3385440	3387440	but it is not so practical.
3387440	3389440	You are not sure
3389440	3391440	if it is really possible in the future.
3391440	3393440	But it seems to be able to do it
3393440	3395440	and seems to be applicable.
3395440	3397440	This thing is called
3397440	3399440	orientation type research.
3399440	3401440	So whether it is orientation type research,
3401440	3403440	basic research,
3403440	3405440	or application type research,
3405440	3407440	you can first explain
3407440	3409440	the importance of your problem.
3409440	3411440	For example,
3411440	3413440	why do people cross the river?
3413440	3415440	How difficult is it to cross the river?
3415440	3417440	After crossing the river,
3417440	3419440	what can you do to help
3419440	3421440	these people?
3421440	3423440	If you change to
3423440	3425440	a practical case,
3429440	3431440	you have to explain
3431440	3433440	the relevance of your research
3433440	3435440	to Taiwan.
3435440	3437440	What can you do to help Taiwan?
3437440	3439440	For example,
3439440	3441440	after solving this problem,
3441440	3443440	how much can you improve
3443440	3445440	Taiwan's academic status?
3445440	3447440	You can write a KPI.
3447440	3449440	You can find a way
3449440	3451440	to give a qualitative
3451440	3453440	or quantitative value
3453440	3455440	to let the reviewer know
3455440	3457440	how much help
3457440	3459440	your research will have
3459440	3461440	in the future.
3461440	3463440	In other words,
3463440	3465440	where is your contribution?
3465440	3467440	If you are applying type research,
3467440	3469440	you have to find a way
3469440	3471440	to write how much value
3471440	3473440	you can contribute.
3473440	3475440	What kind of talents
3475440	3477440	can you cultivate in your plan?
3477440	3479440	What kind of help
3479440	3481440	can these talents
3481440	3483440	bring to Taiwan's industry
3483440	3485440	or Taiwan's academics?
3485440	3487440	So try to use
3487440	3489440	some slogans
3489440	3491440	in your plan.
3491440	3493440	Don't write too much.
3493440	3495440	You have to be specific
3495440	3497440	about what you want to do.
3497440	3499440	You have to be specific
3499440	3501440	about what you want to do.
3501440	3503440	This is more acceptable
3503440	3505440	to the reviewer.
3505440	3507440	This is more acceptable
3507440	3509440	to the reviewer.
3509440	3511440	I applied for the Einstein Project
3511440	3513440	twice.
3513440	3515440	The first time,
3515440	3517440	I didn't write too much.
3517440	3519440	The second time,
3519440	3521440	I didn't write too much.
3521440	3523440	The third time,
3523440	3525440	I didn't write too much.
3525440	3527440	The fourth time,
3527440	3529440	I didn't write too much.
3529440	3531440	I just wrote down
3531440	3533440	what kind of talent
3533440	3535440	I want to cultivate
3535440	3537440	and what kind of value
3537440	3539440	I can contribute.
3539440	3541440	I just wrote down
3541440	3543440	what kind of talent
3543440	3545440	I want to cultivate
3545440	3547440	and what kind of value
3547440	3549440	I can contribute.
3549440	3551440	I just wrote down
3551440	3553440	what kind of talent
3553440	3555440	I want to cultivate
3555440	3557440	and what kind of value
3557440	3559440	I can contribute.
3565440	3567440	So tell me
3567440	3569440	what kind of talent
3569440	3571440	you want to cultivate
3571440	3573440	and what kind of value
3573440	3575440	I can contribute.
3575440	3577440	So tell me
3577440	3579440	what kind of talent
3579440	3581440	you want to cultivate
3581440	3583440	and what kind of value
3583440	3585440	I can contribute.
3602440	3604440	Your plan will reflect
3604440	3606440	your ambition and vision.
3606440	3608440	So it's important to create a vision.
3608440	3610440	In this picture,
3610440	3612440	I just showed you
3612440	3614440	what I said in my self-introduction.
3614440	3616440	Let me say it again.
3616440	3618440	The so-called vision is very important.
3618440	3620440	What kind of dream
3620440	3622440	do you want to achieve
3622440	3624440	through this plan?
3624440	3626440	For example, you are a doctor.
3626440	3628440	You want to cure cancer
3628440	3630440	and save all humans.
3630440	3632440	It sounds very ambitious.
3632440	3634440	It sounds very ambitious.
3634440	3636440	But in fact, this plan
3636440	3638440	hopes that you have
3638440	3640440	such an ambition.
3640440	3642440	It also hopes that you can
3642440	3644440	challenge what others can't.
3644440	3646440	So don't think
3646440	3648440	what you wrote
3648440	3650440	is unlikely to happen.
3650440	3652440	As long as you think
3652440	3654440	your idea is good
3654440	3656440	and helpful to humans,
3656440	3658440	and you are confident
3658440	3660440	that you can make it happen,
3660440	3662440	you should write this plan.
3662440	3664440	Why did I say that?
3664440	3666440	It's because
3666440	3668440	when my sister applied
3668440	3670440	for a college in the U.S.,
3670440	3672440	she thought
3672440	3674440	she wasn't good enough
3674440	3676440	to apply for a good school.
3676440	3678440	So she asked
3678440	3680440	her school's consultant.
3680440	3682440	The consultant told her
3682440	3684440	whether she was good enough
3684440	3686440	wasn't up to her.
3686440	3688440	It's the job of the consultant.
3688440	3690440	So she encouraged her sister
3690440	3692440	to apply for a good school.
3692440	3694440	Don't give up
3694440	3696440	because you think you can't do it.
3696440	3698440	I want to tell you
3698440	3700440	don't give up
3700440	3702440	because you think
3702440	3704440	your plan is not good enough.
3704440	3706440	It's up to the consultant
3706440	3708440	to decide
3708440	3710440	whether you are good enough
3710440	3712440	or not.
3712440	3714440	Don't give up any chance.
3714440	3716440	Let's go back to
3716440	3718440	the application process
3718440	3720440	and the past performance.
3720440	3722440	Now,
3722440	3724440	I'm going to talk about
3724440	3726440	the past research performance.
3726440	3728440	The past research performance
3728440	3730440	is about
3730440	3732440	what papers
3732440	3734440	you submitted
3734440	3736440	in the past research.
3736440	3738440	Of course, this is a superficial idea.
3738440	3740440	You need to look at
3740440	3742440	your research
3742440	3744440	in the past research.
3744440	3746440	Why is your research important?
3746440	3748440	So,
3748440	3750440	I'm going to echo
3750440	3752440	what I just said.
3752440	3754440	Your past research
3754440	3756440	gave the
3756440	3758440	reviewer
3758440	3760440	a direction.
3760440	3762440	Through your past research performance,
3762440	3764440	you got some credits.
3764440	3766440	These credits
3766440	3768440	make the reviewer believe
3768440	3770440	you can do it in the future.
3770440	3772440	So,
3772440	3774440	when you are writing a research plan,
3774440	3776440	you need to
3776440	3778440	have a background
3778440	3780440	to explain
3780440	3782440	your experience
3782440	3784440	in solving
3784440	3786440	this problem.
3786440	3788440	What international teams
3788440	3790440	did you work with
3790440	3792440	in the past research?
3792440	3794440	What important journals
3794440	3796440	did you publish
3796440	3798440	in the past research?
3798440	3800440	How many credits
3800440	3802440	did you get in the past research?
3802440	3804440	What honors
3804440	3806440	did you get
3806440	3808440	in the past research?
3808440	3810440	How hard is it to get these honors?
3810440	3812440	You need to explain
3812440	3814440	to the reviewer.
3814440	3816440	Sometimes,
3816440	3818440	you may think
3818440	3820440	these honors are important
3820440	3822440	in your field,
3822440	3824440	but the reviewer
3824440	3826440	may not know.
3826440	3828440	For example,
3828440	3830440	he may not know
3830440	3832440	what is the
3832440	3834440	Wu Moqing Prize.
3834440	3836440	It is just a
3836440	3838440	certificate of excellence.
3838440	3840440	The name of the
3840440	3842440	sponsor is
3842440	3844440	Wu Moqing.
3844440	3846440	So, when you
3846440	3848440	describe your honors,
3848440	3850440	you need to explain
3850440	3852440	how hard it is
3852440	3854440	to get these honors.
3854440	3856440	The people who
3856440	3858440	get these honors
3858440	3860440	are from
3860440	3862440	world-renowned academic institutions.
3862440	3864440	For example,
3864440	3866440	I got a
3866440	3868440	Zuckerman Fellowship
3868440	3870440	in my postdoc.
3870440	3872440	The people who get
3872440	3874440	this fellowship
3874440	3876440	are from
3876440	3878440	MIT, Harvard,
3878440	3880440	or Stanford.
3880440	3882440	So, when I write
3882440	3884440	these honors,
3884440	3886440	the reviewer
3886440	3888440	will know
3888440	3890440	that I was
3890440	3892440	trustworthy.
3892440	3894440	In other words,
3894440	3896440	I did not
3896440	3898440	lie.
3898440	3900440	When you say
3900440	3902440	you want to do
3902440	3904440	something great,
3904440	3906440	why do people
3906440	3908440	believe you?
3908440	3910440	Because you did
3910440	3912440	something great.
3912440	3914440	The third part
3914440	3916440	is the
3916440	3918440	Global Cooperation Experience
3918440	3920440	and the Future Plans
3920440	3922440	of the International
3922440	3924440	Academy,
3924440	3926440	Professional Society,
3926440	3928440	and Important Jobs.
3928440	3930440	Sorry,
3930440	3932440	my PowerPoint
3932440	3934440	is a bit messy.
3934440	3936440	Let's continue.
3936440	3938440	Global Cooperation Experience
3938440	3940440	and the Future Plans
3940440	3942440	of the International Academy
3942440	3944440	is a part of the Columbus Project,
3944440	3946440	but I recommend
3946440	3948440	people applying for
3948440	3950440	the Einstein Project
3950440	3952440	to refer to it.
3952440	3954440	When you are
3954440	3956440	writing a project,
3956440	3958440	you need to
3958440	3960440	write a research background.
3960440	3962440	You can emphasize
3962440	3964440	which teams
3964440	3966440	you worked with
3966440	3968440	in the field.
3968440	3970440	It is important
3970440	3972440	to know what problems
3972440	3974440	you have solved together.
3974440	3976440	You need to
3976440	3978440	make a name for yourself.
3978440	3980440	If you get
3980440	3982440	the project,
3982440	3984440	will you
3984440	3986440	continue
3986440	3988440	to work with
3988440	3990440	international scholars?
3990440	3992440	For example,
3992440	3994440	will you invite
3994440	3996440	international scholars
3996440	3998440	to give a speech
3998440	4000440	or a workshop
4000440	4002440	in Taiwan?
4002440	4004440	Will you
4004440	4006440	bring international
4006440	4008440	research and development
4008440	4010440	to Taiwan?
4010440	4012440	This is important
4012440	4014440	when you are
4014440	4016440	writing a project.
4016440	4018440	If you get
4018440	4020440	the approval of
4020440	4022440	these scholars,
4022440	4024440	you can include
4024440	4026440	your name, email,
4026440	4028440	or even your signature
4028440	4030440	in your project.
4030440	4032440	This will increase
4032440	4034440	the credibility of
4034440	4036440	your project.
4036440	4038440	Your reviewer
4038440	4040440	will be able to
4040440	4042440	trust you
4042440	4044440	when they see
4044440	4046440	the teams
4046440	4048440	you worked with
4048440	4050440	in the past.
4050440	4052440	Next is
4052440	4054440	the future plan
4054440	4056440	for international scholars
4056440	4058440	or professional organizations.
4058440	4060440	You can write
4060440	4062440	your experience
4062440	4064440	as an SCI
4064440	4066440	or SSCI editor,
4066440	4068440	organizer,
4068440	4070440	host,
4070440	4072440	or agent.
4072440	4074440	For example,
4074440	4076440	I have a friend
4076440	4078440	who worked
4078440	4080440	as a conference
4080440	4082440	host
4082440	4084440	in Taiwan.
4084440	4086440	He wrote
4086440	4088440	his experience
4088440	4090440	and was
4090440	4092440	recognized by
4092440	4094440	the reviewer.
4094440	4096440	If you have
4096440	4098440	held a similar
4098440	4100440	conference,
4100440	4102440	don't be shy
4102440	4104440	and try to
4104440	4106440	write your experience
4106440	4108440	as an SCI
4108440	4110440	or SSCI editor.
4110440	4112440	For example,
4112440	4114440	how many articles
4114440	4116440	you have reviewed,
4116440	4118440	how many meetings
4118440	4120440	you have held,
4120440	4122440	how many cooperation
4122440	4124440	plans you have created,
4124440	4126440	or even
4126440	4128440	whether you are
4128440	4130440	able to lead
4130440	4132440	cross-domain
4132440	4134440	or cross-team
4134440	4136440	in the past.
4136440	4138440	Here,
4138440	4140440	Columbus
4140440	4142440	asks you
4142440	4144440	your future plan
4144440	4146440	for relevant positions.
4146440	4148440	So,
4148440	4150440	you have to
4150440	4152440	explain
4152440	4154440	how to use
4154440	4156440	your past experience
4156440	4158440	as an editor,
4158440	4160440	reviewer,
4160440	4162440	or SCI
4162440	4164440	to improve
4164440	4166440	Taiwan's academic ability.
4166440	4168440	As we all know,
4168440	4170440	being an academic editor
4170440	4172440	or
4172440	4174440	being
4174440	4176440	an
4176440	4178440	academic leader
4178440	4180440	has a very
4180440	4182440	important role
4182440	4184440	in improving
4184440	4186440	Taiwan's academic status.
4186440	4188440	For example,
4188440	4190440	you can recommend
4190440	4192440	foreign scholars
4192440	4194440	to do research
4194440	4196440	in Taiwan.
4196440	4198440	So,
4198440	4200440	being an academic leader
4200440	4202440	is very important.
4202440	4204440	So,
4204440	4206440	when you write your plan,
4206440	4208440	you can try to
4208440	4210440	figure out
4210440	4212440	how to become
4212440	4214440	an academic leader
4214440	4216440	and how to
4216440	4218440	achieve this goal.
4218440	4220440	Next,
4220440	4222440	Columbus asks you
4222440	4224440	your future plan
4224440	4226440	for relevant positions.
4226440	4228440	So,
4228440	4230440	you have to
4230440	4232440	explain
4232440	4234440	your past experience
4234440	4236440	as an editor,
4236440	4238440	reviewer,
4238440	4240440	or SCI to improve
4240440	4242440	Taiwan's academic ability.
4242440	4244440	As we all know,
4244440	4246440	being an academic leader
4246440	4248440	has a very important role
4248440	4250440	in improving
4250440	4252440	Taiwan's academic status.
4252440	4254440	So,
4254440	4256440	you have to
4256440	4258440	explain your past experience
4258440	4260440	as an editor,
4260440	4262440	reviewer,
4262440	4264440	or SCI to improve
4264440	4266440	Taiwan's academic ability.
4266440	4268440	Next,
4268440	4270440	Columbus asks you
4270440	4272440	your future plan
4272440	4274440	for relevant positions.
4274440	4276440	So,
4276440	4278440	you have to
4278440	4280440	explain your past experience
4280440	4282440	as an editor,
4282440	4284440	reviewer,
4284440	4286440	or SCI to improve
4286440	4288440	Taiwan's academic ability.
4288440	4290440	So,
4290440	4292440	you have to
4292440	4294440	explain your past experience
4294440	4296440	as an editor,
4296440	4298440	reviewer,
4298440	4300440	or SCI to improve
4300440	4302440	Taiwan's academic ability.
4302440	4304440	So,
4304440	4306440	you don't have to
4306440	4308440	explain your past experience
4308440	4310440	as an editor,
4310440	4312440	reviewer,
4312440	4314440	or SCI to improve
4314440	4316440	Taiwan's academic ability.
4316440	4318440	So,
4318440	4320440	you don't have to
4320440	4322440	explain your past experience
4322440	4324440	as an editor,
4324440	4326440	reviewer,
4326440	4328440	or SCI to improve
4328440	4330440	Taiwan's academic ability.
4330440	4332440	So,
4332440	4334440	not only can I
4334440	4336440	lead Taiwan's students
4336440	4338440	to research,
4338440	4340440	I can also
4340440	4342440	work with students
4342440	4344440	from different countries,
4344440	4346440	different religious backgrounds,
4346440	4348440	and even different skin colors.
4348440	4350440	So,
4350440	4352440	So,
4352440	4354440	what kind of research
4354440	4356440	did these people do
4356440	4358440	under your leadership?
4358440	4360440	You can talk about
4360440	4362440	all of these.
4362440	4364440	Another part is that
4364440	4366440	if you have a lecture,
4366440	4368440	don't be shy.
4368440	4370440	You can just bring it up
4370440	4372440	and let SCI know.
4372440	4374440	Why?
4374440	4376440	Because the foundation of
4376440	4378440	research teams and training
4378440	4380440	is very important.
4380440	4382440	How do you teach?
4382440	4384440	How do you mentor?
4384440	4386440	If you have a TA award,
4386440	4388440	you can talk about
4388440	4390440	what kind of problems
4390440	4392440	you encountered in the course of teaching,
4392440	4394440	what changes you made,
4394440	4396440	and how your team
4396440	4398440	worked well.
4398440	4400440	Also,
4400440	4402440	you can talk about
4402440	4404440	your research results.
4404440	4406440	So,
4406440	4408440	I hope you can
4408440	4410440	talk about
4410440	4412440	your past experiences
4412440	4414440	so that SCI
4414440	4416440	can clearly understand
4416440	4418440	that you have the ability
4418440	4420440	to build and train your team.
4422440	4424440	Yuxu,
4424440	4426440	hold on.
4426440	4428440	We have 10 minutes left.
4428440	4430440	This segment is a bit long.
4430440	4432440	Let's stop here.
4432440	4434440	If you have
4434440	4436440	any additional questions,
4436440	4438440	you can email me.
4438440	4440440	I can answer
4440440	4442440	your questions individually.
4442440	4444440	Yuxu's email
4444440	4446440	is here.
4446440	4448440	You can copy it.
4448440	4450440	If you want to copy it,
4450440	4452440	I can listen to it.
4452440	4454440	You can write your email
4454440	4456440	or if you have
4456440	4458440	any questions, you can chat.
4458440	4460440	If we have time,
4460440	4462440	we can come back and continue.
4462440	4464440	We have one more question.
4464440	4466440	I believe
4466440	4468440	everyone cares about
4468440	4470440	whether our speakers
4470440	4472440	have experience in
4472440	4474440	other countries or
4474440	4476440	Europe or
4476440	4478440	Israel.
4478440	4480440	What do they think
4480440	4482440	about the cultural differences
4482440	4484440	between Taiwan and
4484440	4486440	other places
4486440	4488440	in terms of
4488440	4490440	industry and
4490440	4492440	industry energy?
4492440	4494440	How do they decide
4494440	4496440	to return to Taiwan
4496440	4498440	or stay abroad?
4498440	4500440	Or how do they see
4500440	4502440	the future development?
4502440	4504440	Let's start with Hao Wei.
4504440	4506440	Okay, no problem.
4506440	4508440	I think
4508440	4510440	your question is
4510440	4512440	about the difference
4512440	4514440	between Taiwan and
4514440	4516440	the United States
4516440	4518440	in terms of
4518440	4520440	industry and
4520440	4522440	industry energy.
4522440	4524440	Hello?
4524440	4526440	Can you hear me?
4526440	4528440	If you can hear me,
4528440	4530440	you can continue.
4530440	4532440	I'm just repeating your question.
4532440	4534440	Okay.
4534440	4536440	I think
4536440	4538440	as a Taiwanese,
4538440	4540440	we always think
4540440	4542440	even if I stay here
4542440	4544440	for 10 years,
4544440	4546440	I still think
4546440	4548440	I might return to Taiwan one day.
4548440	4550440	I think Taiwan's energy
4550440	4552440	is quite strong
4552440	4554440	when it comes to
4554440	4556440	industry and industry energy.
4556440	4558440	So I actually thought
4558440	4560440	I might return to Taiwan one day.
4560440	4562440	But the biggest difference
4562440	4564440	is probably
4564440	4566440	the capital
4566440	4568440	and the
4568440	4570440	idea of
4570440	4572440	starting a business
4572440	4574440	is quite different.
4574440	4576440	So the size of the company
4576440	4578440	and the idea of investors
4578440	4580440	are quite different.
4580440	4582440	So the capital
4582440	4584440	and the business talent
4584440	4586440	are probably more professional
4586440	4588440	when it comes to the company's valuation.
4588440	4590440	On the other hand,
4590440	4592440	in terms of business,
4592440	4594440	Boston's energy
4594440	4596440	is really strong.
4596440	4598440	It's one of the best places in the world.
4598440	4600440	So
4600440	4602440	it takes a lot of capital
4602440	4604440	to do the research.
4604440	4606440	So it's just starting in Taiwan.
4606440	4608440	So we have a lot of BTBA
4608440	4610440	friends who will return to Taiwan
4610440	4612440	to help
4612440	4614440	build these things.
4614440	4616440	So I hope one day
4616440	4618440	we can really build up
4618440	4620440	Taiwan's biotechnology
4620440	4622440	or medical technology.
4622440	4624440	I think even though we're still in the US,
4624440	4626440	we can still help a lot
4626440	4628440	with these links.
4628440	4630440	Yeah, that's it.
4630440	4632440	I have a question.
4632440	4634440	Sorry.
4634440	4636440	Let me adjust my network.
4640440	4642440	Why is it like this?
4642440	4644440	Sorry.
4644440	4646440	Can you hear me?
4646440	4648440	Yes.
4648440	4650440	My question is
4650440	4652440	about
4652440	4654440	wanting to return to Taiwan.
4654440	4656440	Do you have any experience
4656440	4658440	or have you heard
4658440	4660440	whether Taiwan's current industry
4660440	4662440	or the government
4662440	4664440	has any
4664440	4666440	willingness to cooperate
4666440	4668440	or any plans
4668440	4670440	for Taiwan?
4670440	4672440	What are their motives?
4672440	4674440	I think
4674440	4676440	after Minister Chen Liangji took office,
4676440	4678440	he proposed a lot of
4678440	4680440	plans
4680440	4682440	for returning to Taiwan.
4682440	4684440	So he can
4684440	4686440	let you find a job for a year
4686440	4688440	and then you can find
4688440	4690440	the job you really want to do.
4690440	4692440	He has provided some plans
4692440	4694440	to make it more smooth.
4694440	4696440	So I think it's not bad.
4696440	4698440	OK.
4698440	4700440	But when it comes to
4700440	4702440	job opportunities,
4702440	4704440	it really depends
4704440	4706440	on the industry.
4706440	4708440	The prices in the US are higher,
4708440	4710440	so you usually get paid when you go back.
4710440	4712440	But this is expected.
4712440	4714440	Yeah.
4714440	4716440	OK.
4716440	4718440	So do you think,
4718440	4720440	at least as you mentioned,
4720440	4722440	the government
4722440	4724440	has expressed its willingness
4724440	4726440	and actually has plans
4726440	4728440	to help you
4728440	4730440	return to Taiwan
4730440	4732440	or get a job in Taiwan?
4732440	4734440	Yes.
4734440	4736440	It's called LIFT.
4736440	4738440	Oh, OK. LIFT.
4738440	4740440	You can check it out.
4740440	4742440	I've heard of it before.
4742440	4744440	I'm not familiar with it,
4744440	4746440	but I'm sure you can find it on the Internet.
4746440	4748440	Can we ask Mu-Jie
4748440	4750440	about your experience in Europe
4750440	4752440	and in the US
4752440	4754440	since you've just been here for a year?
4754440	4756440	What do you think is the difference?
4756440	4758440	What do you think is the difference
4758440	4760440	between good and bad
4760440	4762440	and what do you think?
4762440	4764440	I think
4764440	4766440	in the US
4766440	4768440	or other places other than Taiwan,
4768440	4770440	I think everyone knows
4770440	4772440	that the salary is higher.
4772440	4774440	In the US,
4774440	4776440	you have the smartest people
4776440	4778440	in the world.
4778440	4780440	Most of the outstanding students
4780440	4782440	are in the US.
4782440	4784440	I don't think
4784440	4786440	we need to emphasize the benefits.
4786440	4788440	But I think
4788440	4790440	now,
4790440	4792440	especially in the academic world,
4792440	4794440	if you're willing to come back
4794440	4796440	at this time,
4796440	4798440	I think it's a good opportunity.
4798440	4800440	The reason is that the current minister
4800440	4802440	and the overall social atmosphere
4802440	4804440	probably all know
4804440	4806440	that fewer and fewer people
4806440	4808440	are willing to come back.
4808440	4810440	I'm not just talking about
4810440	4812440	the Colombo-Einstein project.
4812440	4814440	It's not that everyone can get it.
4814440	4816440	But regardless of
4816440	4818440	your general plan,
4818440	4820440	in fact,
4820440	4822440	there are quite a few
4822440	4824440	increases in salary and annual income.
4824440	4826440	But in my own field,
4826440	4828440	in the past,
4828440	4830440	you might have a one-year or two-year plan.
4830440	4832440	But now, the meaning of the minister
4832440	4834440	is to give people
4834440	4836440	three or even four years.
4836440	4838440	The amount of salary
4838440	4840440	will be higher than before.
4840440	4842440	In addition,
4842440	4844440	the current social atmosphere
4844440	4846440	has been saying that
4846440	4848440	the salary of professors in Taiwan
4848440	4850440	is very low.
4850440	4852440	Now,
4852440	4854440	all professors in Taiwan
4854440	4856440	still have the same standard
4856440	4858440	of paying salary.
4858440	4860440	But each school
4860440	4862440	actually has
4862440	4864440	a lot of different
4864440	4866440	basic salary plans.
4866440	4868440	So I think
4868440	4870440	at least in the early stages,
4870440	4872440	you don't have to worry
4872440	4874440	too much about money.
4874440	4876440	Whether it's research money
4876440	4878440	or your salary money,
4878440	4880440	you don't have to worry too much.
4880440	4882440	Of course, in terms of absolute numbers,
4882440	4884440	it's impossible to compare
4884440	4886440	with the U.S. or other countries
4886440	4888440	because the prices are different.
4888440	4890440	So I don't think
4890440	4892440	you need to worry about this.
4892440	4894440	When I came back before,
4894440	4896440	or other young professors
4896440	4898440	told me that
4898440	4900440	Taiwan's current atmosphere
4900440	4902440	is more and more like
4902440	4904440	as long as you do well,
4904440	4906440	you don't have to worry
4906440	4908440	about your salary
4908440	4910440	or your research money.
4910440	4912440	There must be
4912440	4914440	a lot of different
4914440	4916440	flexible salary plans.
4916440	4918440	For example,
4918440	4920440	I know someone
4920440	4922440	who is a professor in Taiwan.
4922440	4924440	If you really do well,
4924440	4926440	there are a lot of different bonuses.
4926440	4928440	There are some additional bonuses.
4928440	4930440	After you get the bonuses,
4930440	4932440	technology will match
4932440	4934440	your research money.
4934440	4936440	There are
4936440	4938440	other professors
4938440	4940440	who told me that
4940440	4942440	the advantage of Taiwan,
4942440	4944440	especially in the academic world,
4944440	4946440	is that you have a high chance
4946440	4948440	to pass your plan.
4948440	4950440	But at least
4950440	4952440	you can do
4952440	4954440	what you want to do.
4954440	4956440	Of course, if you say
4956440	4958440	you need 30 million or more devices
4958440	4960440	to do an experiment,
4960440	4962440	that's another story.
4962440	4964440	But in general,
4964440	4966440	I saw Zhang Yanyong shaking his head.
4966440	4968440	In general,
4968440	4970440	there should be no problem.
4970440	4972440	I and Ye Yong
4972440	4974440	are shaking our heads.
4974440	4976440	I didn't see the other one.
4976440	4978440	I think this is the current
4978440	4980440	atmosphere in Taiwan.
4980440	4982440	I think
4982440	4984440	I wanted to come back
4984440	4986440	for a part of the reason.
4986440	4988440	I don't know if you know
4988440	4990440	Chen Yunlong,
4990440	4992440	who often appears on TV.
4992440	4994440	The reason is very similar.
4994440	4996440	I like living in Taiwan.
4996440	4998440	I like living in Taiwan,
4998440	5000440	so I'm willing to come back.
5000440	5002440	At that time, I thought
5002440	5004440	if I stayed in the United States,
5004440	5006440	I would only go to the industry.
5006440	5008440	If I really want to be a teacher,
5008440	5010440	I will think I want to go back to Taiwan.
5010440	5012440	Because I think
5012440	5014440	if I want to teach the next generation,
5014440	5016440	I will want to teach
5016440	5018440	people on my own land.
5018440	5020440	I don't know if you have seen it.
5020440	5022440	Yuan Jian also reported that
5022440	5024440	Chen Yunlong's mother
5024440	5026440	said that
5026440	5028440	if he didn't come back,
5028440	5030440	his mother would tell him that
5030440	5032440	she could only see him
5032440	5034440	in Taiwan.
5034440	5036440	I know when you are young,
5036440	5038440	you think it's good to travel abroad.
5038440	5040440	But I have discussed with
5040440	5042440	some people around me.
5042440	5044440	Many people think
5044440	5046440	if I stay in the U.S. or abroad
5046440	5048440	for 10 or 15 years,
5048440	5050440	I still want to come back.
5050440	5052440	It depends on
5052440	5054440	whether you are willing to
5054440	5056440	take these 10 or 15 years
5056440	5058440	to spend time with your family
5058440	5060440	and friends
5060440	5062440	or if you are willing to
5062440	5064440	find a job in the U.S.
5064440	5066440	or other countries.
5066440	5068440	Whether it's economic or
5068440	5070440	other aspects,
5070440	5072440	it's a better return.
5072440	5074440	I don't think this is wrong.
5074440	5076440	It's just that everyone's
5076440	5078440	views are different.
5078440	5080440	Overall, I think that
5080440	5082440	Taiwan's support for young teachers
5082440	5084440	is quite high.
5084440	5086440	This also involves another thing.
5086440	5088440	If you are really willing to
5088440	5090440	travel abroad,
5090440	5092440	you may want to
5092440	5094440	inquire about the atmosphere
5094440	5096440	of each school.
5096440	5098440	The atmosphere of
5098440	5100440	different schools
5100440	5102440	may be different.
5102440	5104440	You may want to
5104440	5106440	inquire about
5106440	5108440	the support for young people.
5108440	5110440	I am quite lucky that
5110440	5112440	our school is quite good.
5112440	5114440	Some places may be worse.
5114440	5116440	You may want to
5116440	5118440	find a job in the U.S.
5118440	5120440	or other countries.
5120440	5122440	It's a good return.
5122440	5124440	It's a good time.
5124440	5126440	Actually,
5126440	5128440	we are running out of time.
5128440	5130440	I think we have covered
5130440	5132440	a lot of interesting points today.
5132440	5134440	Of course,
5134440	5136440	everyone still has a lot of questions.
5136440	5138440	Otherwise,
5138440	5140440	can we ask the three speakers
5140440	5142440	to summarize in two or three minutes
5142440	5144440	what they think about
5144440	5146440	changing the job of
5146440	5148440	PhD students and post-doctorate students?
5148440	5150440	In the process of summarizing,
5150440	5152440	everyone can think about
5152440	5154440	if there are any questions.
5154440	5156440	You can type them in the chat.
5156440	5158440	At the end,
5158440	5160440	we will have a short Q&A.
5160440	5162440	Let's start with Yuxun.
5162440	5164440	I think
5164440	5166440	the global population is expanding.
5166440	5168440	There are 7 billion people now.
5168440	5170440	Even if it is a school,
5170440	5172440	it is difficult to promote.
5172440	5174440	Although I am
5174440	5176440	a survivor,
5176440	5178440	it is not very convincing.
5178440	5180440	But what I want to say is
5180440	5182440	don't be too persistent
5182440	5184440	and have to go a certain way.
5184440	5186440	Let yourself stay flexible.
5186440	5188440	When I was studying
5188440	5190440	for a master's degree,
5190440	5192440	I spent a lot of time
5192440	5194440	studying stock trading.
5194440	5196440	So I thought about
5196440	5198440	if I want to do research,
5198440	5200440	whether I do research or not,
5200440	5202440	I need money.
5202440	5204440	If I do research,
5204440	5206440	it is difficult to make a fortune.
5206440	5208440	So if I invest in finance,
5208440	5210440	I can maintain my basic living expenses.
5210440	5212440	It feels good, right?
5212440	5214440	In addition to studying finance,
5214440	5216440	I also attend
5216440	5218440	some
5218440	5220440	lectures
5220440	5222440	on communication skills.
5222440	5224440	To sum up,
5224440	5226440	don't go too far
5226440	5228440	and try to
5228440	5230440	stay flexible.
5230440	5232440	As I said at the beginning,
5232440	5234440	do what you want to do,
5234440	5236440	but do it in the right way.
5236440	5238440	Go in the direction you want to go.
5238440	5240440	But don't set the direction
5240440	5242440	too narrow.
5242440	5244440	Make it a wider direction.
5244440	5246440	Don't make
5246440	5248440	precise mistakes
5248440	5250440	even if it is wrong.
5250440	5252440	This is what I want to
5252440	5254440	share with you today.
5254440	5256440	Don't ask me
5256440	5258440	what I want.
5258440	5260440	I have invested in stocks for so many years.
5286440	5288440	Hello?
5288440	5290440	Can you hear me?
5290440	5292440	Can you hear me?
5292440	5294440	I can hear you now.
5294440	5296440	Can you
5296440	5298440	summarize
5298440	5300440	your thoughts?
5300440	5302440	Okay, no problem.
5302440	5304440	I think
5304440	5306440	it is good
5306440	5308440	that everyone is willing to
5308440	5310440	participate in this event.
5310440	5312440	I think the most important part
5312440	5314440	of NPS is networking.
5314440	5316440	You need to get to know more people
5316440	5318440	and know what everyone is doing.
5318440	5320440	After graduation,
5320440	5322440	these networks will continue to grow.
5322440	5324440	For a long time,
5324440	5326440	like what they said,
5326440	5328440	Ph.D. is looking for the next job.
5328440	5330440	70% of them are introduced by people they know.
5330440	5332440	So,
5332440	5334440	networking is really important.
5334440	5336440	I hope everyone can
5336440	5338440	get to know more people
5338440	5340440	and know more about what this world is doing
5340440	5342440	in the life of a postdoc or PhD.
5342440	5344440	Of course,
5344440	5346440	the academic world is really competitive.
5346440	5348440	According to statistics,
5348440	5350440	those who can become
5350440	5352440	a professor
5352440	5354440	are the top 10%.
5354440	5356440	Many people will eventually
5356440	5358440	enter the industry,
5358440	5360440	but there are still many opportunities
5360440	5362440	for you to develop
5362440	5364440	and do what you want to do.
5364440	5366440	So, I hope everyone can explore more.
5366440	5368440	And there are many
5368440	5370440	top things
5370440	5372440	that you can do.
5372440	5374440	This is really cool.
5374440	5376440	Thank you, Hao Wei.
5376440	5378440	Mu Jie, please summarize.
5378440	5380440	No problem.
5380440	5382440	I don't think what Hao Wei said is right.
5382440	5384440	I don't think
5384440	5386440	the top 10%
5386440	5388440	come to the academic world.
5388440	5390440	I think a big part
5390440	5392440	is that everyone's career path
5392440	5394440	is different.
5394440	5396440	Many people who are better than me
5396440	5398440	eventually choose to go to the industry.
5398440	5400440	Then I can find
5400440	5402440	something to live for.
5402440	5404440	Actually, I think
5404440	5406440	my point of view is very similar
5406440	5408440	to what Yuxin said.
5408440	5410440	I think
5410440	5412440	you have to choose
5412440	5414440	what you really want to do.
5414440	5416440	No matter
5416440	5418440	if you choose a research topic
5418440	5420440	or whether you want to go to the industry or the classroom.
5420440	5422440	I think this is a very important thing.
5422440	5424440	Especially when you can still choose,
5424440	5426440	it's actually a very happy thing.
5426440	5428440	So when you can choose,
5428440	5430440	try to choose what you think you're interested in.
5430440	5432440	Because I think what you're interested in
5432440	5434440	is what you're willing to spend time and effort
5434440	5436440	to do it well.
5436440	5438440	Because when you're a professor,
5438440	5440440	it's actually quite tiring.
5440440	5442440	Because there are a lot of mixed things.
5442440	5444440	But when you like to do this,
5444440	5446440	you can really do it well.
5446440	5448440	I also think what Yuxin said
5448440	5450440	is very good.
5450440	5452440	Don't worry about
5452440	5454440	giving yourself
5454440	5456440	the courage
5456440	5458440	to correct your direction.
5458440	5460440	Correcting earlier
5460440	5462440	is always better than correcting later.
5462440	5464440	Don't feel like
5464440	5466440	I have to be a professor.
5466440	5468440	In the end, you really can't be a professor.
5468440	5470440	Or no matter what the reason is,
5470440	5472440	you decide not to be a professor.
5472440	5474440	Don't be afraid of what others will think.
5474440	5476440	Because no one will be responsible for your life.
5476440	5478440	Only you have to be responsible for your own life.
5478440	5480440	So I think the most important thing
5480440	5482440	is actually this.
5482440	5484440	Thank you.
5484440	5486440	I think the three speakers
5486440	5488440	talked very well today.
5488440	5490440	Please turn on the microphone now
5490440	5492440	so that the speakers can hear our applause.
5492440	5494440	Please give a round of applause
5494440	5496440	to thank the three speakers
5496440	5498440	for sharing with us today.
5504440	5506440	Thank you.
5506440	5508440	Because our time today
5508440	5510440	is a bit short,
5510440	5512440	but I guess there are still people who want to discuss,
5512440	5514440	so I will turn off the recording first.
