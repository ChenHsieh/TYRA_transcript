0	8000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.
8000	10000	I'm your host, Emma Lin.
10000	17000	I'm currently working on CO2 reduction in Caltech.
17000	20000	Welcome to our talk today.
20000	24000	First, I'd like to introduce our speaker for today, Du Yixiu.
24000	28000	Du Yixiu is a doctoral student at Stanford University.
28000	31000	She graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Physics.
31000	33000	During her time at the university,
33000	36000	she worked as a postdoctoral student at the Zhu Shiwei Laboratory.
36000	41000	She did research on silicon photonics.
41000	44000	During her time at the university,
44000	47000	she went to Berkeley Department of Physics for a year.
47000	51000	At the time, she did research on graphene synthesis.
51000	55000	Yixiu is currently in the Department of Physics at Stanford.
55000	58000	She did her Ph.D. in physics for a year.
58000	65000	She is currently doing her Ph.D. rotation in Professor Gao Sunhong's lab.
65000	68000	The lab she is currently working on is
68000	71000	sound imaging and neuroscience-related research.
71000	74000	Her next interest in the doctoral program
74000	78000	is to combine nanophotonics and neuroscience
78000	80000	to do applications.
80000	83000	The topic of her presentation today is
83000	90000	the research she did with Professor Zhu Shiwei at the university.
90000	94000	The topic of this presentation is
94000	101000	about the rapid development of silicon memory circuits.
101000	105000	People have always wanted to combine silicon
105000	110000	and nanoparticles in a chip
110000	114000	to achieve a real photonical IC.
114000	118000	However, silicon components are relatively large,
118000	121000	so they want to understand
121000	124000	whether they can reduce the magnitude to nanometers
124000	126000	to achieve greater density
126000	129000	while maintaining the nature of nonlinear light.
129000	132000	The topic of this presentation is
132000	135000	the great enhanced photothermal nonlinearity
135000	138000	in a silicon nanoresonator.
138000	141000	Let's give a round of applause
141000	144000	to welcome our speaker today, Du Yixiu.
144000	147000	Thank you for having me.
147000	150000	I'm Du Yixiu.
150000	153000	I don't think there are a lot of people here,
153000	156000	so if you have any questions,
156000	159000	please feel free to ask.
159000	162000	I'm Du Yixiu.
162000	165000	I don't think there are a lot of people here,
165000	168000	so if you have any questions,
168000	171000	please feel free to ask.
171000	174000	I'm Du Yixiu.
174000	177000	I don't think there are a lot of people here,
177000	180000	so if you have any questions,
180000	183000	please feel free to ask.
183000	186000	I'm Du Yixiu.
186000	189000	I'm Du Yixiu.
189000	192000	I don't think there are a lot of people here,
192000	195000	so if you have any questions,
195000	198000	please feel free to ask.
198000	201000	I'm Du Yixiu.
201000	204000	I don't think there are a lot of people here,
204000	207000	so if you have any questions,
207000	210000	please feel free to ask.
210000	213000	I'm Du Yixiu.
213000	216000	Nowadays,
216000	219000	there are some people writing their article
219000	222000	in 2010 called
222000	225000	''The Logical Next Step of an Optical Transistor''.
225000	228000	Now this person publishes his article in 2010 called
228000	231000	''The Logical Next Step of an Optical Transistor''.
231000	234000	The article talks about
234000	237000	two important points
237000	240000	for nano photonics devices.
240000	242000	We want great density
242000	245000	to match the electrical IC.
245000	248000	We also want a good enough functionality.
248000	251000	This functionality is like
251000	254000	an electrolyte.
254000	257000	We want a good enough electron-electron interaction.
257000	260000	Through this electron-electron interaction,
260000	263000	we can control the device.
263000	266000	Can optical do the same?
266000	269000	Let's take a look.
269000	272000	Recently, there is a very popular field
272000	275000	called Silicon Photonics.
275000	278000	You can see the timeline.
278000	281000	In 2003,
281000	284000	it was Silicon Nanophotonics' birthday.
284000	287000	That day, everyone thought about
287000	290000	how to combine
290000	293000	nanoscale silicon waveguide
293000	296000	and micronscale optical fiber
296000	299000	through a technique called
299000	302000	tapping.
302000	305000	Then we can extend
305000	308000	the optical fiber technology
308000	311000	to silicon waveguide technology.
311000	314000	I want to emphasize that
314000	317000	in the past 10 years,
317000	320000	Silicon Photonics' field
320000	323000	has developed rapidly.
323000	326000	Looking back to modern science,
326000	329000	it is hard to see such a rapid development
329000	332000	in 10 years.
332000	335000	Silicon Photonics is
335000	338000	a very popular field.
338000	341000	Next,
341000	344000	I want to talk about
344000	347000	why everyone wants to
347000	350000	use silicon
351000	354000	to realize electronics.
354000	357000	First,
357000	360000	we know that there is a lot of silicon in nature,
360000	363000	so it is very natural abundance.
363000	366000	On the other hand,
366000	369000	silicon has very mature fabrication technology,
369000	372000	so we can make very small devices,
372000	375000	but we can also make a lot of devices.
375000	378000	For various reasons,
378000	381000	electronics has developed rapidly,
381000	384000	so people want to
384000	387000	expand it to the photonics platform.
387000	390000	The reason is that
390000	393000	if we expand to the photonics platform,
393000	396000	we may have
396000	399000	very high speed potential.
399000	402000	We can potentially reach
402000	405000	a very high speed switch.
406000	409000	I want to show you
409000	412000	the technology that combines
412000	415000	photonics and electronics.
415000	418000	Everything in the same platform.
418000	421000	This is an article published in Nature
421000	424000	in 2018.
424000	427000	The left half of the article
427000	430000	is the electronics device, transistor.
430000	433000	On the same chip,
433000	436000	we can see the photonics device.
436000	439000	If we take a closer look,
439000	442000	we can see that
442000	445000	the electronics device
445000	448000	and the photonics device
448000	451000	are all on the same chip.
454000	457000	If you look closely at this scale bar,
457000	460000	there are countless electrical devices
460000	463000	on the same chip.
463000	466000	We can make very good
466000	469000	electrical-based integrated circuits.
469000	472000	But in the case of the photonics device,
472000	475000	we only have one.
475000	478000	Its scale bar is 10 microns,
478000	481000	like this microresonator.
481000	484000	You may ask,
484000	487000	why don't we make it smaller?
487000	490000	Why do we have so many electronic devices?
490000	493000	The reason is that
493000	496000	we want to reduce the footprint
496000	499000	from 10 microns to 100 nanometers.
499000	502000	That's what people think.
502000	505000	But if we want to reduce the footprint,
505000	508000	we have to consider other problems.
508000	511000	For example,
511000	514000	if we reduce the footprint,
514000	517000	we will have the same functionality
517000	520000	as a large size.
520000	523000	One aspect of the functionality
523000	526000	is optical nonlinearity.
526000	529000	The optical nonlinearity of silicon
529000	532000	is very small.
532000	535000	The definition of nonlinearity is
535000	538000	if I increase the intensity of my illumination,
538000	541000	my refractive index
541000	544000	will also increase.
544000	547000	This coefficient represents
547000	550000	the nature of the nonlinearity of the material itself.
550000	553000	Because our silicon
553000	556000	is a very small nonlinearity,
556000	559000	can we increase its intensity?
559000	562000	Well, people think like Lipson.
562000	565000	In Columbia,
565000	568000	Lipson thought about
568000	571000	whether to use a resonance structure
571000	574000	to make the resonance bigger.
574000	577000	For example,
577000	580000	the structure of the microresonator,
580000	583000	the SEM2,
583000	586000	can reach a very sharp spectrum
586000	589000	and symbolize a very high quality factor.
589000	592000	With such a resonance structure,
592000	595000	we can increase the functionality of our devices.
595000	598000	However,
598000	601000	we want to make a very small device.
601000	604000	Is there a way
604000	607000	to make such a small device?
607000	610000	Although the quality factor is very low,
610000	613000	can we use other ways
613000	616000	to reduce the quality factor?
616000	619000	Can we find other nonlinearity mechanisms
619000	622000	to make our functionality
623000	626000	maintain the same?
626000	629000	This is the most classic example
629000	632000	of a resonator in a microresonator.
632000	635000	The so-called mixed resonator
635000	638000	provides a resonance
638000	641000	at a very small magnitude.
644000	647000	If we look at this SEM2,
647000	650000	it has different resonance
650000	653000	colors,
653000	656000	such as blue,
656000	659000	green, and red.
659000	662000	This microresonator is size-dependent.
662000	665000	There is a lot of research
665000	668000	on this matter,
668000	671000	especially in the past 10 years.
671000	674000	The so-called high-index material
674000	677000	has a very special resonance phenomenon.
677000	680000	It was published in 2017.
680000	683000	It is Yusuke Nagasaki,
683000	686000	my collaborator.
686000	689000	He did the research.
689000	692000	It is a silicon-on-top-of-quartz structure.
692000	695000	This structure can fine-tune
695000	698000	the width of each silicon nanoparticle,
698000	701000	such as Wx and Wy.
701000	704000	With different combinations of widths,
704000	707000	we can get a rainbow-like structure.
707000	710000	This rainbow-like structure
710000	713000	tells us that
713000	716000	we have a very good ability
716000	719000	to fine-tune the resonance.
719000	722000	Our future research
722000	725000	will use a similar sample.
725000	728000	The next thing I want to talk about
728000	731000	is that since our nanostructure
731000	734000	has such a weak resonance,
734000	737000	is there any way
737000	740000	to increase it with other mechanisms?
740000	743000	We all know that
743000	746000	photothermal is a solution.
746000	749000	Is there any other mechanism
749000	752000	to maintain its nonlinearity?
752000	755000	The answer is that
755000	758000	we can combine photothermal
758000	761000	and nonlinear resonance.
761000	764000	As you know,
764000	767000	the photothermal effect
767000	770000	is a very large nonlinear effect.
770000	773000	In a small-scale nanoparticle,
773000	776000	it is a very efficient optical heater.
776000	779000	In this paper in 2017,
779000	782000	he sprinkled silicon
782000	785000	on the surface of SiO2
785000	788000	to show that
788000	791000	in a specific dimension,
791000	794000	the silicon nanoparticle
794000	797000	has a very strong optical heating effect.
797000	800000	We can heat this silicon nanoparticle
800000	803000	to about 600K.
803000	806000	Because of these two reasons,
806000	809000	it is a very efficient optical heater.
809000	812000	So maybe we can
812000	815000	use it to combine
815000	818000	nano-resonance to achieve
818000	821000	a greater nonlinear effect.
821000	824000	So our work combines two things.
824000	827000	The first thing is a very weak
827000	830000	nano-resonance,
830000	833000	but it is a very small nanostructure.
833000	836000	The other part is
836000	839000	the photothermal effect.
839000	842000	The photothermal effect provides
842000	845000	a very large nonlinear effect.
845000	848000	If we combine these two things,
848000	851000	we can get a greater nonlinear effect.
851000	854000	If we compare
854000	857000	these two things,
857000	860000	we can get a very small nanostructure
860000	863000	and a very good photothermal effect.
863000	866000	If we compare
866000	869000	the photothermal effect,
869000	872000	we can see that
872000	875000	in ordinary materials,
875000	878000	the nonlinear coefficient is about
878000	881000	10 to the power of 9.
881000	884000	After the enhanced nonlinearity
884000	887000	of the photosynthesis,
887000	890000	we can increase the nonlinear coefficient
890000	893000	by 3 orders.
893000	896000	This is the process we are going to discuss.
896000	899000	This is our system.
899000	902000	We want to achieve
902000	905000	resonance.
905000	908000	We need to characterize
908000	911000	the resonance.
911000	914000	So we use a dark field system.
914000	917000	This dark field system
917000	920000	allows us to get a spectrum
920000	923000	This is a confocal system.
923000	926000	The light follows the orange light.
926000	929000	It hits the object
929000	932000	and passes through the gobbled mirror
932000	935000	to select the particle you want.
935000	938000	Finally, it enters the spectrum meter.
938000	941000	On the other hand,
941000	944000	we want to stimulate the photothermal effect.
944000	947000	So we use a 5.6E laser.
947000	950000	It passes through the gobbled mirror
950000	953000	to control where we want to hit the particle.
953000	956000	It illuminates the silicon nanostructure.
956000	959000	We also use a dark field system
959000	962000	to get a background-free,
962000	965000	clean image.
965000	968000	This is the resonance we get.
968000	971000	We can see that by controlling
971000	974000	different nanostructures,
974000	977000	such as Wx and Wy,
977000	980000	we can get a very colorful image.
980000	983000	This colorful image tells us
983000	986000	that the resonance of each particle
986000	989000	is completely different.
989000	992000	So we can expect
992000	995000	a different photothermal effect.
995000	998000	If we look at this line,
998000	1001000	we can use a 5.6E laser
1001000	1004000	to do photothermal illumination.
1004000	1007000	Under this illumination,
1007000	1010000	we can see that
1010000	1013000	there are three peaks
1013000	1016000	of scattering intensity
1016000	1019000	at three different degrees.
1019000	1022000	This result is quite similar
1022000	1025000	to the simulation.
1025000	1028000	So we can say that
1028000	1031000	in the silicon nanostructure
1031000	1034000	at 100 nm,
1034000	1037000	there is a magnetic dipole,
1037000	1040000	an electric dipole,
1040000	1043000	and a magnetic quadrupole.
1043000	1046000	Why do we choose a 5.6E wavelength?
1046000	1049000	Because with a 5.6E wavelength,
1049000	1052000	we can see different resonance peaks
1052000	1055000	at the same time.
1055000	1058000	Different resonance peaks
1058000	1061000	affect the nonlinear behavior.
1061000	1064000	With the same 5.6E wavelength,
1064000	1067000	we can trigger
1067000	1070000	two different absorption peaks.
1070000	1073000	This is why we choose a 5.6E wavelength.
1073000	1076000	I have been talking about
1076000	1079000	nonlinear effects.
1079000	1082000	In fact, what we want to discuss
1082000	1085000	is that if we increase
1085000	1088000	the excitation intensity,
1088000	1091000	what will happen to
1091000	1094000	the optical properties?
1094000	1097000	If it is a linear case,
1097000	1100000	if we increase the excitation intensity,
1100000	1103000	the scattering intensity
1103000	1106000	will also grow linearly.
1106000	1109000	However, if it is a nonlinear case,
1109000	1112000	the scattering intensity
1112000	1115000	will saturate.
1115000	1118000	Since we want to control
1118000	1121000	the intensity of the light,
1121000	1124000	we need to adjust the power.
1124000	1127000	We can adjust it like this.
1127000	1130000	Or we can
1130000	1133000	make good use of
1133000	1136000	our scanning system.
1136000	1139000	We can move the beam like this.
1139000	1142000	By moving it like this,
1142000	1145000	we can also
1145000	1148000	saturate the nanostructure
1148000	1151000	at different intensities.
1151000	1154000	In this case,
1154000	1157000	we can see that in a linear case,
1157000	1160000	there will be a linear scattering growth.
1160000	1163000	In a nonlinear case,
1163000	1166000	there is a hole in the middle of our image.
1166000	1169000	It has a dominance shape.
1169000	1172000	This dominance shape tells us that
1172000	1175000	at the center point,
1175000	1178000	where the intensity of the light is the highest,
1178000	1181000	we have a relatively small
1181000	1184000	scattering behavior.
1184000	1187000	This is a very strange phenomenon.
1187000	1190000	If we want to quantify this phenomenon,
1190000	1193000	this is the result of
1193000	1196000	one of the size 190 nm nanoparticles.
1196000	1199000	When we increase the excitation intensity,
1199000	1202000	the scattering intensity will
1202000	1205000	have a saturation phenomenon.
1205000	1208000	We will see the point spread function
1208000	1211000	of this dominance shape.
1211000	1214000	Similarly,
1214000	1217000	for example,
1217000	1220000	we will also see
1220000	1223000	a saturation phenomenon.
1223000	1226000	In 170 nm nanoparticles,
1226000	1229000	we can't find particles at low intensities.
1229000	1232000	But when we increase the
1232000	1235000	excitation intensity,
1235000	1238000	the particles will suddenly come out.
1238000	1241000	The scattering will suddenly increase a lot.
1241000	1244000	One thing to note is that
1244000	1247000	this phenomenon is reversible.
1247000	1250000	We can restore it.
1250000	1253000	It is not related to the damage
1253000	1256000	caused by the light.
1256000	1259000	To summarize,
1259000	1262000	different nanoparticles
1262000	1265000	have different scattering deviations.
1265000	1268000	Scattering deviations like
1268000	1271000	100 nm nanoparticles
1271000	1274000	will have a decrease in intensity.
1274000	1277000	In 170 nm nanoparticles,
1277000	1280000	the intensity will increase a lot.
1280000	1283000	This phenomenon is not only
1283000	1286000	a nonlinear phenomenon
1286000	1289000	on this diagonal axis.
1289000	1292000	In fact,
1292000	1295000	in different combinations of
1295000	1298000	Wx and Wy,
1298000	1301000	we can observe
1301000	1304000	this very large nonlinear effect.
1304000	1307000	Why do I say it's very large?
1307000	1310000	Because in the
1310000	1313000	nonlinear effect of
1313000	1316000	normal silicon itself,
1316000	1319000	we will only produce
1319000	1322000	about 10 to the power of 9 percent optical modulation.
1322000	1325000	But in this case,
1325000	1328000	we will only produce
1328000	1331000	about 500 percent
1331000	1334000	or minus 70 percent
1334000	1337000	nonlinear modulation.
1337000	1340000	In addition,
1340000	1343000	I want to talk about another thing.
1343000	1346000	We just saw a summary.
1346000	1349000	The nonlinear behavior of
1349000	1352000	different nanoparticles is different.
1352000	1355000	What is the relationship between them?
1355000	1358000	We can see that
1358000	1361000	in the negative nonlinearity,
1361000	1364000	like this saturation,
1364000	1367000	the spectrum on the resonance
1367000	1370000	is a peak.
1370000	1373000	On the other hand,
1373000	1376000	this 170 nm nanoparticle
1376000	1379000	looks like a dip on the resonance spectrum.
1379000	1382000	But we won't catch all the peaks.
1382000	1385000	For example,
1385000	1388000	this 130 nm nanoparticle
1388000	1391000	is a scattering peak,
1391000	1394000	but we can't observe the nonlinear behavior.
1394000	1397000	Why is that?
1397000	1400000	We will explain further
1400000	1403000	with the photo thermal effect we just mentioned.
1403000	1406000	First of all,
1406000	1409000	the photo thermal effect
1409000	1412000	does exist in our system.
1412000	1415000	We have experimental evidence
1415000	1418000	and simulated evidence.
1418000	1421000	In the experimental evidence,
1421000	1424000	we can use the Raman microscope
1424000	1427000	to observe how many degrees
1427000	1430000	the silicon nanoparticle has risen.
1430000	1433000	Our answer is about a few hundred degrees.
1433000	1436000	This is quite consistent with the literature.
1436000	1439000	In the simulation,
1439000	1442000	we can see that
1442000	1445000	the silicon nanostructure
1445000	1448000	only has a very strong temperature increase
1448000	1451000	in a specific geometry.
1451000	1454000	This is the photo thermal effect we observed.
1454000	1457000	If we heat up a silicon nanoparticle,
1457000	1460000	the photo thermal effect
1460000	1463000	produces heat.
1463000	1466000	This heat
1466000	1469000	increases the refractive index.
1469000	1472000	This increase in the refractive index
1472000	1475000	leads to the change in the mean resonance.
1475000	1478000	This increase in the refractive index
1478000	1481000	leads to the change in the mean resonance.
1481000	1484000	This leads to the nonlinear effect we mentioned.
1484000	1487000	We simulated
1487000	1490000	this blue curve.
1490000	1493000	Our scattering
1493000	1496000	is the blue curve
1496000	1499000	for different size distributions.
1499000	1502000	When we increase the radius,
1502000	1505000	we get the red curve.
1505000	1508000	Because different particles
1508000	1511000	have different refractive indexes,
1511000	1514000	the cross-section of the scattering is different.
1514000	1517000	If we combine these two lines,
1517000	1520000	we get the black curve.
1520000	1523000	This black curve
1523000	1526000	is very consistent with the experiment.
1526000	1529000	This black curve is very consistent with the experiment.
1529000	1532000	This black curve is very consistent with the experiment.
1532000	1535000	This explains the effect of our observation
1535000	1538000	of the photo thermal effect.
1538000	1541000	In addition,
1541000	1544000	In addition,
1544000	1547000	we simulated these three
1547000	1550000	170 and 190 neoparticles
1550000	1553000	as a single nonlinear curve.
1553000	1556000	as a single nonlinear curve.
1556000	1559000	This is very consistent with the experiment.
1559000	1562000	This further proves that
1562000	1565000	the photo thermal effect
1565000	1568000	is the nonlinearity mechanism.
1568000	1571000	is the nonlinearity mechanism.
1571000	1574000	If you hear the word photo thermal effect,
1574000	1577000	many people may think
1577000	1580000	that if the device is controlled by thermal energy,
1580000	1583000	it may be very slow.
1583000	1586000	But in fact,
1586000	1589000	the photo thermal effect is not necessarily slow.
1589000	1592000	In terms of magnitude, it is very slow.
1592000	1595000	But in terms of magnitude,
1595000	1598000	our experiment and simulation
1598000	1601000	have shown that
1601000	1604000	the photo thermal effect observed
1604000	1607000	on the silicon nanostructure
1607000	1610000	is very fast.
1610000	1613000	At this point,
1613000	1616000	if we turn on the 785nm laser,
1616000	1619000	there will be a large drop in the velocity.
1619000	1622000	there will be a large drop in the velocity.
1622000	1625000	This time scale is about 2ns.
1625000	1628000	This simulation also tells us the same thing.
1628000	1631000	This simulation also tells us the same thing.
1631000	1634000	If we look at this picture,
1634000	1637000	we can get a very fast thermal response
1637000	1640000	of 1GHz.
1640000	1643000	of 1GHz.
1643000	1646000	It tells us that it is a minus 50% nonlinear effect.
1646000	1649000	It tells us that it is a minus 50% nonlinear effect.
1649000	1652000	So we can make a device
1652000	1655000	with a 50% deviation.
1655000	1658000	with a 50% deviation.
1658000	1661000	But it still maintains a very fast speed of 1GHz.
1661000	1664000	But it still maintains a very fast speed of 1GHz.
1664000	1667000	Another interesting observation is
1667000	1670000	that when we
1670000	1673000	When we
1673000	1676000	When we
1676000	1679000	can we go back to the screen?
1679000	1682000	Can we go back to the screen?
1682000	1685000	What is the input image?
1685000	1688000	What is the input image?
1688000	1691000	What is the input image?
1691000	1694000	What is the input image?
1694000	1697000	The x-axis of the laser...
1698000	1701000	The insert...
1701000	1704000	The insert...
1704000	1707000	The insert...
1715000	1718000	You choose a peak and not a z-axis,
1718000	1721000	You choose a peak and not a z-axis,
1721000	1724000	because the laser...
1724000	1729000	you can choose any size to reach the peak
1737000	1741000	Our sample is placed at room temperature
1741000	1746000	but the Photo Thermal Effect is a local thermal effect
1746000	1751280	So the sensitization of the very small thickness
1751280	1756280	but the surrounding area is maintained
1760280	1763280	Thank you for the question
1763280	1767280	Another interesting phenomenon is
1767280	1770280	if it is a Photo Thermal Effect
1770280	1779280	then we change the surrounding thermal diffusion
1779280	1786280	For example, if the thermal diffusion is changed
1786280	1789280	then we should see a different phenomenon
1789280	1792280	The result is that our Point Spreading Function
1792280	1795280	has a very sharp transition
1795280	1798280	This is our profile
1798280	1801280	When we enter high laser intensity
1801280	1804280	we will have a very strange triangular change
1804280	1809280	This triangular change tells us a very shaky phenomenon
1809280	1813280	But we don't know how to explain it yet
1813280	1817280	Let me make a conclusion
1817280	1823280	We observed a very large Photo Thermal Nonlinearity
1823280	1828280	We combined two things to achieve this result
1828280	1833280	The first thing is that we want to reduce the size
1833280	1838280	So we will use the material of Mean Resonance
1838280	1841280	We use the material of nanometer
1841280	1845280	Usually we think of Mean Resonance
1845280	1848280	Although the quality factor is very low
1848280	1853280	but we have other ways to solve this problem
1853280	1857280	So we meet the size requirement
1857280	1861280	How to meet the functionality requirement?
1861280	1866280	We use a very powerful natural
1866280	1874280	change of Photo Thermal Nonlinearity
1874280	1877280	Combining these two things
1877280	1881280	we can create a Photo Thermal Effect
1881280	1884280	larger than the original Bulk
1884280	1889280	Because of the Enhanced Mean Resonance
1889280	1894280	So we can get a very large Nonlinearity Effect
1894280	1897280	Like this picture
1897280	1900280	When we increase Excitation Intensity
1900280	1902280	Scattering Intensity saturates
1902280	1906280	and even creates a donut shape
1906280	1908280	Another thing is that
1908280	1910280	this Photo Thermal Effect
1910280	1915280	is not necessarily as slow as the large scale
1915280	1917280	In fact, in a small scale
1917280	1926280	we have proven the recovery speed of a nanosecond
1926280	1930280	This allows us to make a 1GHz
1930280	1935280	about 50% deviation device
1935280	1939280	So I want to thank you for listening
1939280	1942280	and thank you to my advisor
1943280	1945280	at Taiwan University of Physics
1945280	1949280	And I want to thank my co-authors
1949280	1951280	like Yusuke Nagasaki
1951280	1954280	He is at Osaka University
1954280	1957280	I was lucky enough to go to Osaka University
1957280	1960280	for a while
1960280	1962280	and got to know them
1962280	1964280	They gave me great help
1964280	1968280	Finally, they helped us with
1969280	1972280	fabrication
1972280	1975280	So thank you for listening
1975280	1978280	I am happy to take any questions
1978280	1979280	Thank you
1988280	1993280	Thank you Yusuke
1993280	1998280	Any questions?
2017280	2020280	The first question is
2020280	2023280	I want to know how fabrication is done
2023280	2031280	Where does silicon-on-quartz come from?
2031280	2037280	We bought the silicon-on-quartz structure from Company
2037280	2043280	How does it work?
2043280	2047280	It uses pure silicon
2047280	2052280	to oxidize the bottom layer into SiO2
2052280	2057280	The top layer is cut off with ion beam
2061280	2066280	Wait, you said you bought the SOI structure?
2066280	2068280	Yes
2068280	2073280	Usually the SOI structure is made of silicon
2073280	2076280	The silicon is thicker
2076280	2080280	But the SOI structure is different
2080280	2085280	It's made of quartz
2085280	2089280	It's made of two layers
2089280	2091280	So it's wafer-bonding?
2091280	2093280	Yes
2097280	2100280	Another question is
2100280	2105280	I want to know how the donor shape is formed
2119280	2128280	If we move the excitation beam from left to right
2128280	2132280	Because the excitation beam is a Gaussian shape
2132280	2136280	When we pass through the nanostructure
2136280	2140280	The excitation of the nanostructure
2140280	2145280	is from the small innumeration to the big innumeration
2145280	2148280	When the big innumeration occurs
2148280	2153280	The Gaussian beam hits the nanostructure
2153280	2158280	So when we do confocal scanning
2158280	2163280	We are also varying the power density
2163280	2166280	So the image you show is not the real image
2166280	2169280	It's a scanning image
2169280	2175280	The raw data we get is like this
2175280	2178280	So the image is scanned?
2178280	2180280	Yes
2184280	2188280	It's processed at the end
2188280	2192280	The last question is
2192280	2196280	This kind of mini-resonator
2196280	2198280	It has a large load
2198280	2202280	And it's not easy to couple
2202280	2207280	My understanding is that it's hard to couple to nanofortanites
2207280	2211280	Is there any way to solve this problem?
2211280	2215280	This is a great question
2215280	2218280	For coupling
2218280	2221280	Because the mainstream of nanofortanites
2221280	2224280	Is to use the silicon waveguide
2224280	2230280	So it's hard to couple to the silicon waveguide
2230280	2232280	That's right
2232280	2237280	But we don't necessarily
2238280	2244280	It can be made like a gate
2244280	2246280	Like this
2246280	2249280	This is a potential application
2249280	2252280	We have a silicon waveguide
2252280	2257280	We put a mini-resonator on it
2257280	2262280	If the intensity of my silicon waveguide is very strong
2262280	2266280	Or we put a high beam on the right
2266280	2269280	To heat the silicon nanofortanite
2269280	2273280	We use another kind of wavelength
2273280	2276280	To communicate
2276280	2279280	Although the load of the mini-resonator is large
2279280	2285280	But its load will not affect the communication wavelength
2285280	2291280	Why not?
2291280	2296280	Because it's a bit like a pump probe
2296280	2301280	We use an irrelevant wavelength to pump it
2301280	2306280	Its purpose is to increase the temperature
2306280	2311280	Of course, the on-off ratio can be done very well
2311280	2316280	But your signal will always have a loss
2316280	2321280	No matter if you have a gate
2321280	2326280	The loss of your waveguide will always be large
2326280	2328280	It should be like this
2328280	2331280	Yes, because it's more of a scatter
2331280	2335280	But I think we can use engineering
2335280	2339280	To make the loss smaller through different wavelengths
2340280	2344280	Like this picture
2348280	2351280	If we look at the absorption on the right
2351280	2354280	It's about 800 nm or more
2354280	2358280	The silicon itself has no absorption
2358280	2363280	So through different wavelengths
2363280	2368280	With different geometry of the mini-resonator
2368280	2373280	We can adjust the absorption
2373280	2376280	To make the loss as small as possible
2381280	2386280	Is the main current of silicon waveguide 1.5μm?
2386280	2391280	Why do you want to do it in the visible range?
2391280	2394280	Because in the visible range
2394280	2397280	We have enough absorption
2397280	2402280	If it's 1.5μm, we don't have enough absorption
2404280	2411280	Does this become a point to pay attention to in the future?
2411280	2417280	Because most waveguides should be at 1.5μm or 1.1μm
2417280	2422280	Yes, so the communication we want to send
2422280	2426280	Should still be in the range of 1.5μm
2426280	2429280	But what we emphasize here is
2429280	2434280	Our nanometer structure can produce enough heat
2434280	2439280	This heat can be enough to change the refractive index
2439280	2444280	You mean you still have to use visible to pump
2444280	2449280	Then you use 1.5 to probe
2449280	2454280	This is the application in my mind
2455280	2461280	So the potential structure we saw just now
2461280	2464280	It hasn't been done yet
2464280	2468280	It hasn't been done yet
2468280	2471280	Will ThermoLight affect your 1.5?
2471280	2477280	Will the evidence of this not being tested be affected?
2477280	2480280	No, this will be the next project
2484280	2489280	Hello
2489280	2496280	Will the refractive index be affected by visible light?
2496280	2501280	If you choose, like you just said, there are about 5 or 6 waves
2501280	2504280	If you choose differently, maybe
2504280	2508280	I think it's about the same
2508280	2510280	I didn't hear it clearly
2510280	2513280	No, because the picture you just showed
2513280	2515280	There are about 4 or 5 peaks
2515280	2520280	I just asked you why you used the 750-pixel picture
2520280	2522280	Oh, yeah
2522280	2524280	But the other lasers
2524280	2529280	The other wavelength lasers feel more difficult to obtain
2529280	2531280	A little bit, yeah
2531280	2533280	Yeah
2534280	2538280	It's okay, 400
2538280	2541280	A little more than 400, so there's a chance
2541280	2545280	This is done in the collaborator lab
2545280	2550280	Their equipment is only 785
2555280	2559280	But I think in terms of quantity
2559280	2563280	I don't think Timescale will guess a lot
2577280	2579280	Hello
2590280	2594280	Any other questions?
2599280	2602280	I have a general question
2602280	2605280	Because I'm not involved in this field
2605280	2607280	I want to ask
2607280	2610280	Basically in this field
2610280	2613280	The current level of development is
2613280	2616280	You just said you want to scale
2616280	2619280	When you want to scale smaller and smaller
2619280	2622280	You want to maintain the quality of the laser beam
2622280	2624280	And reduce other costs
2624280	2626280	In this field
2626280	2629280	Are there already a lot of people doing it?
2629280	2631280	Or are you the pioneers?
2631280	2633280	And besides this direction
2633280	2636280	What other directions do you think
2636280	2641280	Have the potential to improve this problem?
2642280	2644280	I think
2644280	2648280	The interaction between light and light itself is very small
2648280	2652280	So generally everyone will try to
2652280	2656280	Make the resonance structure bigger
2656280	2660280	Solve this problem through geometric methods
2660280	2664280	The most famous example is
2664280	2669280	Microlipson's microbeam resonator
2669280	2674280	The structure shown in the beginning
2676280	2679280	So I believe
2679280	2682280	Photonic's mainstream is something like this
2682280	2686280	But everyone is still trying
2686280	2690280	So they haven't thought about how to make the device smaller
2690280	2692280	Are they just proposing ideas
2692280	2695280	Or have they already made some prototypes?
2695280	2698280	Photonic has already made something
2698280	2703280	Many companies are already selling this kind of device
2704280	2708280	So what are they doing with the microbeam?
2708280	2710280	Waveguide
2710280	2712280	Waveguide control
2715280	2721280	How do they use the microbeam to control?
2722280	2724280	Usually
2724280	2726280	If
2726280	2729280	If I have a beam
2729280	2731280	If I have an EM wave
2731280	2734280	Passed through the waveguide
2734280	2738280	If the frequency of my EM wave
2738280	2742280	Just meets the resonance structure of the nanostructure
2742280	2747280	Then it will be completely trapped in this structure
2747280	2749280	Will not continue to propagate
2749280	2752280	So it can play the role of off
2753280	2757280	The biggest discovery of Microlipson
2757280	2762280	Is that he put a
2762280	2765280	Put a potential
2765280	2767280	Electrical potential
2767280	2769280	Put a gating
2769280	2773280	This gating will cause the refractive index to change
2774280	2778280	So it can choose which light to pass and which light not to pass
2778280	2781280	I have seen a similar structure before
2781280	2784280	But it seems to be like
2784280	2786280	You just
2786280	2790280	The light is from top to bottom
2790280	2792280	But it seems to be
2792280	2794280	A very similar structure
2794280	2796280	It can go from top left to bottom right
2796280	2798280	But it can't go from bottom right to top left
2798280	2800280	But
2800280	2803280	But I think this thing
2803280	2804280	I didn't understand at that time
2804280	2806280	I just looked at its abstract
2806280	2808280	It can do this
2812280	2814280	But I wanted to ask you
2814280	2817280	Do you know how he did it?
2817280	2819280	I don't know
2819280	2821280	You can find the abstract
2821280	2824280	I don't seem to be
2824280	2826280	Glenn Davison
2826280	2829280	A professor at Maryland
2829280	2831280	They are also doing Microlipson
2831280	2835280	So what you said is that it can only pass in one direction
2835280	2837280	It can't pass in another direction
2837280	2839280	Although it uses a pathway
2839280	2840280	Yes
2840280	2842280	So I thought it was amazing at that time
2842280	2846280	But I didn't take a closer look at it
2846280	2848280	Have to find it again
2848280	2854280	So what is the biggest advantage of its circular disk type?
2854280	2858280	Compared to your general straight line web guide
2858280	2862280	Because it will have a resonance structure
2862280	2866280	It will have a resonance structure
2866280	2868280	Called Whisper Gallery
2868280	2870280	So the energy is stronger
2870280	2872280	The signal is stronger
2874280	2876280	I remember you have a picture
2876280	2878280	It will have about four
2878280	2880280	Two peaks
2880280	2882280	I remember in the front or the back
2884280	2885280	This one
2885280	2886280	Yes
2886280	2890280	Their separation
2890280	2894280	It probably has something to do with the radius of this ring
2894280	2896280	Or the size
2896280	2898280	Or the voltage
2898280	2900280	Of course
2900280	2904280	So how much is the Q of this one?
2904280	2908280	This Q is probably 10
2908280	2910280	5-quart scale
2912280	2914280	5-quart scale is pretty good
2914280	2918280	Microcality is also about 6-7 quarts
2921280	2923280	But in Mi Resonance
2923280	2927280	The quality factor is probably only 1000
2927280	2931280	So there is a difference of 3 quarts
2933280	2937280	So I can only use other mechanisms
2937280	2940280	To achieve the same energy
2944280	2945280	Sorry
2945280	2948280	Mi Resonator has 1000?
2949280	2950280	Sorry
2950280	2953280	About 10-100
2953280	2954280	Ok
2954280	2956280	So the picture you just showed
2956280	2958280	Is about 10-100
2958280	2959280	Yes
2959280	2960280	Scale
2960280	2961280	Ok
2967280	2969280	Thank you everyone for your passionate questions
2969280	2971280	Anyone else has questions?
2971280	2973280	No
2978280	2981280	Du Yixiu
2981280	2983280	You can
2983280	2986280	If any of you
2986280	2988280	Have other questions after the talk
2988280	2990280	You can contact Du Yixiu
2990280	2992280	Through his email
2992280	2995280	And Yixiu you can leave your email in the chat
2995280	2997280	If you want to ask
3001280	3004280	Click on the chat on the right
3009280	3011280	Can I type?
3011280	3013280	You can
3019280	3021280	Can you hear me?
3021280	3022280	Yes
3022280	3024280	I want to ask
3024280	3026280	Thank you for your talk
3026280	3028280	I want to ask
3028280	3030280	You mentioned that
3030280	3032280	It has a nonlinear effect
3032280	3034280	So it changed the N2 part
3035280	3037280	The current nonlinear effect
3037280	3039280	Is what I want to compare
3039280	3041280	Yes
3041280	3043280	If you have a strong current nonlinear effect
3043280	3046280	You should also have a strong 2-photon absorption
3046280	3048280	In this device
3048280	3050280	I want to say
3050280	3052280	The question is
3052280	3054280	If you have a strong 2-photon absorption
3054280	3057280	You can directly use the 1.5 wavelength
3057280	3060280	Or use a more transparent wavelength
3060280	3063280	To achieve a strong nonlinear effect
3063280	3065280	Nonlinear effect
3065280	3067280	I don't know if you've tried it
3067280	3069280	Some people do it like this
3069280	3071280	But
3071280	3076280	To trigger the 2-photon absorption
3076280	3079280	We need a very strong intensity
3079280	3081280	So they use a femtosecond laser
3081280	3083280	I see
3083280	3085280	So you guys
3085280	3087280	I see
3087280	3089280	So you guys
3089280	3091280	Don't have a femtosecond laser
3091280	3093280	Not that I don't have a problem
3093280	3096280	We want to use the minimum intensity
3096280	3098280	Minimum intensity
3098280	3101280	To trigger the nonlinearity
3101280	3103280	I see
3103280	3105280	I can ask
3105280	3107280	I'm not sure if you compare like this
3107280	3109280	But I want to
3109280	3111280	Understand a little bit more
3111280	3113280	If you put your excitation
3113280	3115280	These power density
3115280	3117280	Then you normalize it
3117280	3119280	Absorption cross action
3119280	3121280	You probably
3121280	3123280	How many photons do you need
3123280	3127280	To start seeing these nonlinear effects
3132280	3134280	Can you say it again
3134280	3136280	Because your excitation
3136280	3138280	Most of the light
3138280	3140280	Doesn't really couple to
3140280	3142280	Its resonant mode
3142280	3144280	Because its gathering cross action is very small
3144280	3146280	But if you put your
3146280	3148280	Excitation power density
3149280	3151280	To normalize its
3151280	3153280	Absorption cross action
3153280	3155280	Which means that you
3155280	3157280	Really excite the structure of the photon
3157280	3159280	How many photons do you need
3159280	3161280	To be able to see
3161280	3163280	Its nonlinear phenomenon
3166280	3168280	Or
3168280	3170280	Because you emphasize that it is very strong
3170280	3172280	You may be able to see very small power
3172280	3174280	Just
3174280	3176280	See this nonlinear effect
3176280	3178280	Do you have some
3178280	3180280	More quantitative
3180280	3182280	Comparison method
3182280	3184280	How much power
3184280	3186280	Or how many photons
3186280	3188280	Do you need
3188280	3190280	How much intensity
3190280	3192280	If it is
3198280	3200280	If it is
3200280	3202280	5
3202280	3204280	Megawatts per
3204280	3206280	square meter
3206280	3208280	Right
3208280	3210280	General nonlinearity is
3210280	3212280	10 to the power of 9
3212280	3214280	I see
3214280	3216280	In our case
3216280	3218280	There will be a very large deviation
3218280	3220280	I see
3220280	3222280	So if you
3222280	3224280	10 to the power of 9
3224280	3226280	If there is such a phenomenon
3226280	3228280	Then I almost have to
3228280	3230280	5 times 10 to the power of 9
3230280	3232280	To be able to use
3232280	3234280	Absorption of two photons
3234280	3236280	To achieve a similar effect
3236280	3238280	I see
3238280	3240280	I see OK
3240280	3242280	Then I can probably
3242280	3244280	Thank you for your answer
3244280	3246280	Thank you
3246280	3248280	Thank you
3250280	3252280	OK
3252280	3254280	Thank you all for your questions
3254280	3256280	Then I will stop
3256280	3258280	That's all for today's speech
3258280	3260280	I will stop recording
