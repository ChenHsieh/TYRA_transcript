0	7000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TerraTalk.
7000	12000	We are very honored to have Wang Chenghe in Germany to give us a speech.
12000	19000	The topic of today's speech is Coupling Cell-Cell Adhesion to Cell Polarization.
19000	24000	It is mainly a research on biophysics.
24000	36000	First, let me introduce our speaker today.
36000	40000	Our speaker today is Wang Chenghe.
40000	42000	He is currently in Germany.
42000	44000	He graduated from the University of Taiwan Institute of Technology.
44000	49000	When he was a master's thesis, he did a preliminary personalized breast cancer drug test.
49000	57000	After graduation, he served in Taiwan for three years in the light company.
57000	60000	The main thing is to do 3D laser imaging development.
60000	66000	After graduation, he did a measurement study of cell grafting in the Institute of Medical Sciences.
66000	72000	Then, from his previous field in the Institute of Medical Sciences, he switched to the field of biophysics.
72000	79000	Currently, he is a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute of Cell Biology and Genetics in Germany.
79000	83000	What he is studying now is what he is going to tell us today.
83000	89000	It is the early cell-cell adhesion study of cell polarization.
89000	96000	We remind everyone that we have to turn on the microphone to applaud our speaker.
96000	99000	Let's applaud to welcome our speaker.
99000	104000	Thank you all. Please start.
104000	106000	Thank you all.
106000	110000	I just introduced myself. I am Wang Chenghe.
110000	113000	I am now in the third year of my doctoral studies.
113000	118000	I am going to share with you my research in the past three years.
118000	123000	If you have any questions later, you can interrupt me.
123000	126000	You can interrupt me and ask questions directly.
126000	128000	We can discuss at the same time.
128000	131000	If you have any questions, please say a phrase first.
131000	133000	Then ask your question.
133000	135000	Otherwise, I may continue to talk at once.
135000	138000	Because there is a lag, I am afraid that this will be interfered with.
138000	142000	I am currently a doctoral student in Germany.
142000	149000	My research is actually looking at the connection between cells and the relationship between cell polarization.
149000	152000	This is a very big topic.
152000	155000	I don't know what the background is today.
155000	158000	So I prepared a simple general introduction.
158000	162000	The main thing is to connect cells.
162000	167000	You should know that we have learned from high school students that cells are composed of organs.
167000	172000	So cells have a regular arrangement in the animal body.
172000	176000	It can be arranged into different organs or organs with different functions.
176000	179000	One of the organs is called the epithelium.
179000	182000	In Chinese, it is the upper arm cell.
182000	186000	It basically consists of cells in the animal body.
186000	190000	It is a cell organ that surrounds these cells.
190000	195000	For example, like your kidney or your stomach.
195000	198000	These cells will have such a cell on top.
198000	201000	As you can see, this is my mouse.
201000	202000	It doesn't matter.
202000	206000	Anyway, one of the features of this cell is that when it forms a cell,
206000	209000	it is mainly a simple single cell.
209000	213000	Then go around this cell to form such a structure.
213000	215000	You can see that the lower right corner is a multi-layer cell.
215000	219000	But most of them are actually single cells that form such a structure.
219000	223000	Why does this cell form such a structure?
223000	224000	And what mechanism do they have?
224000	227000	In fact, this has been studied for a very, very long time.
227000	232000	Such a single cell is connected to a single cell.
232000	236000	They actually have some common features to share.
236000	241000	One of the features is that there is a tree on top of it.
241000	247000	It is an epithelial membrane that does not connect to anything.
247000	248000	We call it epithelial membrane.
248000	251000	There is nothing on this cell.
251000	253000	It can be said that there is no contact with any cell
253000	254000	or this kind of epithelial membrane.
254000	256000	It is epithelial membrane.
256000	259000	Then there will be some connections between cells.
259000	260000	Because you know that these cells are linked together.
260000	263000	So it is very intuitive to think that they form a connection.
263000	265000	This connection is what we call a lateral membrane.
265000	268000	The third membrane is the basal membrane.
268000	271000	The basal membrane is the membrane that the cell connects to the external environment,
271000	277000	the ECM, or the reflection environment of the cell.
277000	278000	Basal membrane.
278000	284000	So there are only three main membranes in this cell.
284000	288000	Everyone is very curious about how the cell controls each cell
288000	292000	so that these three membranes can be placed well
292000	294000	and form a connection at the same time.
294000	296000	Then it will not form a strange shape,
296000	299000	but a slightly organized shape.
299000	303000	So this matter, whether in biophysics or biophysics,
303000	306000	is actually a problem that has been studied for a very long time.
306000	310000	To do this kind of research, you can use a lot of different materials.
310000	312000	You can do mouse experiments.
312000	313000	You can do things.
313000	314000	You can do anything.
314000	315000	You can do cell lines.
315000	318000	Like me, I focus on using cell lines.
318000	320000	So I don't do animal experiments.
320000	323000	The cell line I use is a cell called MDCK.
323000	325000	MDCK cells are mainly...
325000	328000	The origin of MDCK cells is the sacral tube of the dog.
328000	331000	So it will form a wall.
331000	333000	It will form a tube.
333000	334000	Let's say a tube.
334000	337000	But in fact, in a lot of research, it just forms a sphere.
337000	338000	OK, anyway, I don't care.
338000	341000	Our study model,
341000	344000	it looks for two cells from one cell.
344000	345000	Everyone knows the cell division.
345000	348000	After the division, it will form a cell-cell connection at the beginning.
348000	350000	Let me find a reference here.
350000	351000	Its label is green.
351000	353000	The green part is the connection between two cells.
353000	355000	The two blue ones are the two cell boxes.
355000	359000	OK, and then it continues to grow.
359000	361000	After it continues to grow, it will form the one on the far right.
361000	362000	The one you see now.
362000	363000	Blue is still a cell box.
363000	365000	Green is the connection between cells.
365000	367000	This is a plane.
367000	370000	What you see now is a sphere.
370000	372000	The red one is what I just said.
372000	374000	The place in the middle of the box.
374000	375000	It's a lumen.
375000	380000	It's a lumen with all kinds of liquid and all kinds of nutrients in it.
380000	382000	A box with all kinds of molecules in it.
382000	383000	It's a lumen.
383000	387000	Then the cells form a single cell connection structure like this.
387000	389000	Then wrap the lumen in the middle.
389000	391000	We call it cyst.
391000	394000	If you have ever studied MDCK culture,
394000	398000	you will know that if you put it in an environment where there are no cells,
398000	400000	it will grow like this.
400000	401000	OK.
401000	404000	If you remember what I just said,
404000	406000	Epico, Lateral and Basal,
406000	408000	three different membranes.
408000	409000	In more detail,
409000	412000	these three membranes are actually filled with different molecules.
412000	414000	Whether it's liquid or protein.
414000	418000	But what I'm talking about here is protein.
418000	420000	Protein on the membrane.
420000	421000	In Epico,
422000	425000	I've listed two types here.
425000	427000	One is called protocollicin or CrOMS.
427000	430000	You don't have to remember these names.
430000	431000	But in Epico,
431000	433000	please remember protocollicin first.
433000	434000	This protein.
434000	436000	Because I will use this protein in the next experiment.
436000	441000	To represent whether the cells have grown Epico membranes.
441000	442000	This thing.
442000	443000	Then there's Basal.
443000	444000	Indicator.
444000	445000	It's like the corner of a cell.
445000	448000	It will form a connection with the nucleus of the cell.
449000	452000	I didn't do too much of Basal.
452000	454000	I did it more in the previous lab.
454000	456000	But I'm not focusing on this now.
456000	458000	So I won't cover it here today.
458000	460000	Then there are cells.
460000	461000	It's like my title today.
461000	462000	Cellular adhesions.
462000	467000	Cellular adhesions have a lot of different types.
467000	469000	We call it adhesion receptor.
469000	473000	You can think of it as a plug.
473000	475000	Protein is like a plug.
475000	477000	It will connect.
477000	478000	It will form a cell-cell connection.
478000	480000	There are four types here.
480000	482000	I only listed about four types.
482000	485000	In fact, it can be roughly divided into orange and red.
485000	487000	Two are a kind.
487000	488000	It's a kind.
488000	490000	Then the blue and green below are another kind.
490000	492000	You just have to remember the green one.
492000	493000	E-cadherin.
493000	496000	Because I will use E-cadherin to represent the next experiment.
496000	499000	Lateral adhesions between cell membranes.
499000	501000	So anyway.
501000	506000	In short, these three domains are defined by these different protein distributions.
507000	513000	In past research, many people have removed these different proteins.
513000	517000	If you are not a biological background,
517000	520000	Protein's performance is removed in this cell.
520000	522000	It doesn't produce this protein.
522000	525000	Then look at what impact it has on the entire structure.
525000	529000	Pay attention to the sphere structure in the upper right corner.
529000	530000	It's a normal structure.
530000	533000	If you remove any protein, it doesn't produce that structure.
533000	539000	It means that the polarization of this cell is affected.
539000	544000	So after removing some proteins, you will see that it produces more than one lumen.
544000	548000	It means that the mechanism of the epico-membrane is affected.
548000	550000	Or more seriously,
550000	558000	Other influences may cause it to grow into a sphere.
558000	561000	Or grow into a very large cluster, like a tumor.
561000	564000	So after removing a protein,
564000	567000	What is the final result?
567000	571000	In fact, a lot of papers have already started to study this.
571000	573000	A lot of papers have been doing this since 2000.
573000	577000	But what we want to end up in this study is the process.
577000	582000	That is, in the entire dynamics, from one cell to this multi-cell process.
582000	584000	How are these proteins affected by each other?
584000	588000	And when are these proteins produced?
588000	589000	And where are they?
589000	591000	And when is it important?
591000	594000	It's important for the whole thing to grow into a normal shape.
594000	597000	This is what I'm mainly doing.
599000	602000	If you look at the three pictures above me,
602000	604000	You will find that the process is actually very simple.
604000	605000	The cells are divided into two cells.
605000	607000	The two cells continue to separate and separate.
607000	610000	Finally, it grows into such a spherical structure.
610000	612000	But you can notice one thing.
612000	618000	The red epico here is the domain of the epico.
618000	621000	It's actually not in the final right.
621000	625000	It was produced under the multi-cell situation on the right.
625000	627000	It was already produced when there were two cells.
627000	629000	In the middle of the two cells,
629000	634000	You can say that it is almost in the middle of the domain where the two cells are connected.
634000	636000	Just produced this epico domain.
636000	639000	This epico domain is produced in such an early state.
639000	643000	So we are very curious about how the mechanism tells the cell
643000	645000	You have to throw your epico domain there.
645000	649000	Instead of throwing it somewhere else.
649000	651000	So we are curious about this.
651000	653000	In addition,
655000	658000	It's not actually split into two from one.
658000	660000	It will form this domain.
660000	661000	This is from my own data.
661000	663000	You put the two cells together.
663000	667000	Then after a long time, it will eventually form this epico domain.
667000	668000	The red part is the epico domain.
668000	670000	The green part is the same as above.
670000	672000	It's the adhesion of the two cells.
672000	677000	So we have an intuitive idea.
677000	680000	Will it be when the two cells are connected?
680000	681000	These proteins.
681000	682000	I just marked four next to it.
682000	684000	One of them tells the cell that
684000	686000	OK, I have a neighbor next to me.
686000	688000	I now have this neighbor.
688000	693000	So I have to produce an epico membrane between me and my neighbor.
693000	697000	So we came up with a project at the beginning.
697000	698000	It's very intuitive.
698000	699000	Since it's two cells,
699000	701000	Which one do we want to see?
701000	702000	Protein
702000	703000	Cells connect to proteins.
703000	706000	It's dominated by this thing.
706000	709000	So let's get rid of a cell.
709000	712000	It's like hitting a single cell.
712000	713000	Let's do this.
713000	719000	Then we replace one of the cells with a supported lipid bilayer.
719000	721000	It's a lipid bilayer.
721000	722000	You know from the name.
722000	726000	It's a double-layered membrane.
726000	733000	We put different receptors on this membrane.
733000	735000	Lateral adhesion receptor.
735000	737000	Put it on this membrane.
737000	741000	Then we can see what kind of reaction the cell will have to which type.
741000	744000	So after we drop the cell,
744000	747000	Let's look at the interaction between it and the receptor below.
747000	749000	This receptor is on the membrane.
749000	752000	One of the benefits of the supported lipid bilayer above is
752000	755000	If you only have a fixed situation,
755000	757000	Cell adhesion is dead.
757000	759000	It can't self-organize.
759000	762000	It can't do what it wants to do.
762000	764000	So if we put it on the lipid bilayer,
764000	766000	It can move freely.
766000	767000	So after the cell goes down,
767000	769000	It can depend on its own
769000	771000	Whether it's its own internal mechanics
771000	773000	Or its own chemical reaction
773000	775000	Will produce the same result.
775000	778000	Ideally, we can find
778000	781000	Some kind of receptor
781000	784000	That can activate the epico-domain
784000	786000	Between the cells.
786000	789000	But unfortunately,
789000	792000	The cells don't like this environment.
792000	795000	So I spent a year and a half doing this.
795000	798000	The cells actually ate it.
798000	803000	This research is actually quite useful.
803000	807000	Because it purifies a lot of different proteins.
807000	810000	We tried to do this experiment.
810000	812000	But the cells don't like it.
812000	815000	But that doesn't mean this method won't work.
815000	818000	It's just that we may need a very long time at this stage.
818000	821000	So I gave up this method.
821000	823000	And I didn't do it in this direction.
823000	825000	I started to do this experiment
825000	828000	In a situation that wasn't so ambitious.
828000	831000	So we went back to the state of two cells.
831000	833000	We don't have to do bilayer.
833000	835000	We just observe these two cells.
835000	837000	What must be missing in the middle?
837000	839000	We didn't notice.
839000	841000	Because the cells don't like the receptor.
841000	843000	And the cells will die.
843000	845000	And the epico-domain won't be produced.
845000	847000	So we went back to the literature.
847000	850000	To see how it goes from one cell to two cells.
850000	853000	The first process is cell division.
853000	855000	In the last step of cell division,
855000	857000	Cut the two cells apart.
857000	861000	There is a step called cytokinesis.
861000	864000	Those of you who studied cell biology should know.
864000	872000	Cytokinesis is a very strong cytoskeletal force.
872000	875000	It's like a circular scissor.
875000	877000	Cut the link between the two cells.
877000	879000	After the cut,
879000	881000	If a cell doesn't form a link,
881000	883000	It will form two independent cells.
883000	885000	But what we see now is the epithelial cell.
885000	887000	Two cells will form a link.
887000	889000	So it's not completely cut off.
889000	892000	At the same time, it forms a link.
892000	894000	When it forms a link,
896000	898000	I forgot to say one thing.
898000	900000	Before it's cut off,
900000	904000	There will be a tubulin between the two cells.
904000	907000	Tubulin is also a cytoskeleton.
907000	909000	It's a kind of bridge.
909000	910000	A track.
910000	911000	It will stay there.
911000	913000	We call it the midbody.
913000	919000	This midbody will remain in the entire cell division.
919000	931000	The midbody is the place where the epithelial domain is generated.
931000	933000	Next, there will be vesicles.
933000	937000	These vesicles carry the proteins that form the epithelial membrane.
937000	939000	Or lipids.
939000	942000	The proteins will be transported to this place.
942000	944000	After the transportation,
944000	947000	These proteins are fused to the middle.
947000	949000	After being fused,
949000	951000	It will expand more and more.
951000	953000	These epithelial domains are connected.
953000	955000	But the proteins in the epithelial domain
955000	957000	don't form a link.
957000	959000	So we thought that
959000	961000	they will form a repulsive force.
961000	963000	And gradually expand.
963000	967000	This process has been studied by many people.
967000	969000	Many people already know
969000	973000	what kind of proteins are important for this delivery.
973000	975000	What can we do?
975000	977000	We care about the selection of cells.
977000	980000	So we think that the connection between cells
980000	984000	should be interplayed with delivery.
984000	987000	So the first thing we suspect is
987000	992000	the important selection of the epithelial membrane.
992000	994000	We think it's high junction.
994000	996000	OK, I haven't said what high junction is.
996000	998000	High junction is the picture on the right.
998000	1000000	It's a small T-J.
1000000	1002000	So if you look at the picture on the right,
1002000	1003000	If you think of it as 3D,
1003000	1005000	The entire lumen is a sphere.
1005000	1009000	The T-J high junction is like a round ring.
1009000	1011000	Then this sphere,
1011000	1014000	You can think of it as a channel.
1014000	1016000	It's like a channel of this lumen.
1016000	1019000	Seal this lumen.
1019000	1023000	So we think that
1023000	1027000	This high junction has always been
1027000	1031000	This lumen and its lateral adhesion
1031000	1033000	The interface between its cellular connections.
1033000	1035000	So we think it has something to do with
1035000	1039000	the production of the entire epithelial membrane.
1039000	1041000	So the next question is
1041000	1043000	I have a question.
1043000	1049000	How fast is the time scale of this whole process?
1049000	1054000	OK, so from the leftmost cell division
1054000	1057000	Then to the rightmost one, it's about 6 hours.
1057000	1059000	5 to 6 hours.
1059000	1061000	5 to 6 hours.
1061000	1065000	Is it about the same time for each step?
1065000	1067000	Or which one is particularly long?
1067000	1069000	Which one is particularly long?
1069000	1073000	From the four schematics I drew below
1073000	1075000	I took four schematics.
1075000	1077000	The one on the right and the one on the left
1077000	1081000	It's about four hours apart.
1081000	1085000	You mean the last arrow, right?
1085000	1088000	Yes, so it's from the first schematic to the third.
1088000	1090000	Maybe only one hour in the middle.
1090000	1092000	Oh, I see.
1092000	1094000	But the last one takes several hours.
1094000	1096000	I see. OK.
1096000	1098000	OK, thank you.
1098000	1100000	So we're curious about
1100000	1102000	When was this high junction produced?
1102000	1104000	Let me introduce it to you today.
1104000	1106000	What is high junction?
1106000	1108000	If you remember, I just talked about epico, lateral, and basal.
1108000	1110000	Three domains.
1110000	1112000	In fact, there is a red band in the middle.
1112000	1114000	I didn't introduce it.
1114000	1116000	That's high junction.
1116000	1122000	It's in the interface between epico and lateral membrane.
1122000	1124000	And it will always exist in that place.
1124000	1128000	The main protein group
1128000	1132000	There are actually a lot of high junction protein groups.
1132000	1134000	Basically, what I drew here
1134000	1136000	The red, blue, and purple on the schematic.
1136000	1138000	The three are its receptors.
1138000	1142000	The main ones are occluden, occluden, and GEMS.
1142000	1144000	Of course, occluden has a lot of kinds of occluden.
1144000	1146000	Occluden has a lot of kinds of occluden.
1146000	1148000	GEMS has a lot of kinds.
1148000	1150000	So it's not just a protein.
1150000	1152000	It has a lot of kinds.
1152000	1154000	On the inside of the cell
1154000	1156000	You can see that there is a yellow, orange, and green.
1156000	1158000	Three proteins.
1158000	1160000	ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3.
1160000	1162000	It's actually a high junction.
1162000	1166000	It's connected to the inside of the cell.
1166000	1168000	It's not directly connected to other cells.
1168000	1172000	But it's connected to occluden, GEMS, and occluden.
1172000	1174000	This picture is a bit misleading.
1174000	1176000	I haven't found a better one yet.
1176000	1178000	I'm sorry.
1178000	1180000	It doesn't mean that ZO1 is based on occluden.
1180000	1182000	ZO2 is based on occluden.
1182000	1184000	ZO3 is based on GEMS.
1184000	1186000	The three are actually mixed together.
1186000	1188000	In my understanding.
1188000	1190000	It's not just based on one kind.
1190000	1192000	ZO1 can be based on three proteins.
1192000	1196000	Anyway, it's a mixed state here.
1196000	1200000	I hope everyone can remember ZO1 protein.
1200000	1204000	Because ZO1 protein is a very important protein in my next experiment.
1204000	1206000	There has been research to prove that.
1206000	1210000	Obviously, after you remove ZO1 and ZO2.
1210000	1212000	After the cells do not produce these two proteins.
1212000	1214000	The high junction between the cells will not be produced.
1214000	1216000	This is very important to my experiment.
1216000	1218000	Everyone remember this first.
1218000	1222000	Its main function is high junction.
1222000	1224000	So, as the name suggests, it's very tight.
1224000	1228000	So, it's the closest link between cells.
1228000	1230000	It's a close connection.
1230000	1234000	It's like the whole cell connection is sealed together.
1234000	1240000	So, you can imagine that the entire lumen can be considered to be sealed by this high junction.
1240000	1244000	So, we think that whether there is a high junction to produce lumen.
1244000	1246000	It will definitely have a relationship.
1246000	1248000	So, let's start the next experiment.
1248000	1250000	OK.
1250000	1252000	What I want to say here is.
1252000	1254000	I just talked about high junction.
1254000	1256000	And epical membrane.
1256000	1258000	What is the situation in the middle?
1258000	1260000	How is it produced?
1260000	1262000	Why can the high junction be produced in the middle?
1262000	1264000	So, I just went back to the schematic I just mentioned.
1264000	1266000	From cell division to lumen.
1266000	1268000	The color is a bit messy here.
1268000	1270000	Sorry, I have a lot of slimes here.
1270000	1272000	OK.
1272000	1274000	The red one represents the cytokinesis I just mentioned.
1274000	1276000	Contractile ring.
1276000	1278000	It's like a knife.
1278000	1280000	Cut the two cells apart.
1280000	1282000	The green one is the high junction I just mentioned.
1282000	1284000	It will form the lumen.
1284000	1286000	In the reference diagram.
1288000	1290000	The small schematic with the high junction.
1290000	1292000	It's a half-circle.
1292000	1294000	A diagram.
1294000	1296000	So, the blue high junction is a cell.
1296000	1298000	The blue low junction is a cell.
1298000	1300000	The red one is the protein representing the red circle.
1300000	1302000	The red one is the protein representing the red circle.
1302000	1304000	The protein slowly cuts into the cell membrane.
1304000	1306000	The protein slowly cuts into the cell membrane.
1306000	1308000	Cut the cells apart.
1308000	1310000	At the same time.
1310000	1312000	It will put the later adhesions.
1312000	1314000	Remember the protein eCathctors and eHearing.
1314000	1316000	It will carry these two cells.
1316000	1318000	It will carry these two cells.
1318000	1320000	It's a gap now that puts the later adhesions.
1320000	1322000	It will ahead of itself.
1326000	1328000	Like I said before,
1328000	1330000	there's a mid-body.
1330000	1332000	A right center.
1332000	1334000	There's a tubulin.
1336000	1336000	
1336000	1338000	creating the later adhesion.
1338000	1340000	So the mid-body is important.
1340000	1342000	So the mid-body is important.
1342000	1344000	But the mid-body will be cut off.
1344000	1346000	But the mid-body will be cut off.
1346000	1348000	Because the two cells need to be completely separated.
1348000	1350000	So there must be a point
1350000	1352000	So there must be a point
1352000	1354000	for the later adhesion to stop.
1354000	1356000	We think that's what Pythagoras is doing.
1356000	1358000	Pythagoras stops
1358000	1360000	near the mid-body
1360000	1362000	so that the later adhesion
1362000	1364000	won't directly invade
1364000	1366000	the area between the cells.
1366000	1368000	We want to leave this gap
1368000	1370000	so that the apical membrane can be created.
1370000	1372000	This is one of our assumptions.
1372000	1374000	The reason why I say this
1374000	1376000	is because we observe
1376000	1378000	the cytokinesis
1378000	1380000	in the process of cell separation.
1380000	1382000	The high junction and
1382000	1384000	the later adhesion,
1384000	1386000	both exist at the same time
1386000	1388000	as the cytokinesis ring.
1388000	1390000	as the cytokinesis ring.
1390000	1392000	As you can see here,
1392000	1394000	you can imagine
1394000	1396000	the cytokinesis cell
1396000	1398000	is behind the screen.
1398000	1400000	So you can see the interface
1400000	1402000	between the two cells.
1402000	1404000	There is such a large actin,
1404000	1406000	the cytokinesis countertowel ring.
1406000	1408000	It separates the two cells.
1408000	1410000	At the same time, you can see
1410000	1412000	the ZO1 and E-cadherin,
1412000	1414000	these two proteins,
1414000	1416000	are wrapped inside
1416000	1418000	the large countertowel ring
1418000	1420000	or collocalized.
1420000	1422000	So when we see this,
1422000	1424000	the ZO1 is squeezed
1424000	1426000	in the middle.
1426000	1428000	The E-cadherin
1428000	1430000	has its mechanism
1430000	1432000	to keep it outside.
1432000	1434000	The good later adhesion
1434000	1436000	also keeps the ZO1
1436000	1438000	which is the place
1438000	1440000	where the next ethical membrane
1440000	1442000	is going to be created.
1442000	1444000	At the same time,
1444000	1446000	we want to know
1446000	1448000	if there is no ZO1,
1448000	1450000	is there no
1450000	1452000	E-cadherin,
1452000	1454000	then we will
1454000	1456000	remove the ZO1 and ZO2
1456000	1458000	proteins inside the cell.
1458000	1460000	So here you can see
1460000	1462000	a cross-section
1462000	1464000	of the entire cyst.
1464000	1466000	So the wild type on the left,
1466000	1468000	the black hole in the middle
1468000	1470000	is the lumen.
1470000	1472000	The E-cadherin,
1472000	1474000	the lumen in the middle
1474000	1476000	is very spherical.
1476000	1478000	After the ZO1 and ZO2
1478000	1480000	are removed,
1480000	1482000	there is still a small lumen in the middle.
1482000	1484000	At first, we thought
1484000	1486000	there was still a lumen after the ZO1 and ZO2 were removed.
1486000	1488000	Maybe it has nothing to do
1488000	1490000	with the lumen.
1490000	1492000	At the same time,
1492000	1494000	if we carefully draw
1494000	1496000	the lumen contour,
1496000	1498000	believe me,
1498000	1500000	it will look like this.
1500000	1502000	We think it is
1502000	1504000	a flower-shaped lumen.
1504000	1506000	Based on this,
1506000	1508000	we think
1508000	1510000	whether the lumen
1510000	1512000	has something to do
1512000	1514000	with the E-cadherin.
1514000	1516000	The E-cadherin
1516000	1518000	may not have anything to do
1518000	1520000	with the E-cadherin.
1520000	1522000	But whether the lumen
1522000	1524000	can grow into a sphere
1524000	1526000	may have something to do
1526000	1528000	with the E-cadherin.
1528000	1530000	I have a question.
1530000	1532000	I have a question
1532000	1534000	and a small suggestion.
1534000	1536000	Can you try to move
1536000	1538000	your mouse,
1538000	1540000	your arrow?
1540000	1542000	Yes, I just tried to move it.
1542000	1544000	So it can't appear
1544000	1546000	on the screen.
1546000	1548000	OK, I just wanted to say
1548000	1550000	if you can see the arrow,
1550000	1552000	you can use it to point.
1552000	1554000	No, it doesn't matter.
1554000	1556000	I have another question
1556000	1558000	about this research.
1558000	1560000	In fact,
1560000	1562000	if you look at the schematic above,
1562000	1564000	it is actually very zoomed in
1564000	1566000	to the edge
1566000	1568000	that is about to be broken.
1568000	1570000	But the picture below
1570000	1572000	is a picture of the entire
1572000	1574000	large area of the microscope.
1574000	1576000	So you have to
1576000	1578000	directly see
1578000	1580000	the ABC picture
1580000	1582000	of the small area
1582000	1584000	in the process of hypothesizing.
1584000	1586000	Your microscope should have, for example,
1586000	1588000	tens or hundreds of nanometers
1588000	1590000	of resolution, right?
1590000	1592000	In fact, it doesn't have to be
1592000	1594000	like this.
1594000	1596000	The series of pictures below
1596000	1598000	is just a snapshot.
1598000	1600000	So I'm not sure
1600000	1602000	what the red schematic is.
1602000	1604000	I'm not sure where it is.
1604000	1606000	If you want to see the small area,
1606000	1608000	in fact,
1608000	1610000	if you can resolve
1610000	1612000	to 100 nanometers
1612000	1614000	or 200 nanometers,
1614000	1616000	you can see a point.
1616000	1618000	But if you really want to see
1618000	1620000	that my microscope has super resolution,
1620000	1622000	we're doing this thing.
1622000	1624000	It can resolve to
1624000	1626000	20 nanometers or 30 nanometers.
1626000	1628000	OK.
1628000	1630000	OK. OK. OK.
1630000	1632000	So can you talk now?
1632000	1634000	Yes, I can talk now.
1634000	1636000	In the ABC picture,
1636000	1638000	the red thing is acting,
1638000	1640000	right?
1640000	1642000	Yes.
1642000	1644000	You said that acting cut off the cell ring.
1644000	1646000	That is to say,
1646000	1648000	the inside of the membrane, right?
1648000	1650000	Yes.
1650000	1652000	The inside of the cell membrane.
1652000	1654000	Why is there still a layer of acting outside the cell membrane?
1656000	1658000	I didn't find this schematic very well.
1658000	1660000	It's actually...
1660000	1662000	I should have drawn it myself.
1662000	1664000	This reference is actually talking about
1664000	1666000	the state of the entire monolayer.
1666000	1668000	So the other acting he drew
1668000	1670000	outside is
1670000	1672000	the third cell.
1672000	1674000	This...
1674000	1676000	This is my mistake. I'm sorry.
1676000	1678000	That's the third cell's
1678000	1680000	acting inside the cell membrane.
1680000	1682000	Yes.
1682000	1684000	I should have made it clear.
1684000	1686000	Sorry.
1686000	1688000	OK.
1688000	1690000	OK.
1690000	1692000	OK.
1692000	1694000	I'll continue.
1694000	1696000	OK.
1696000	1698000	OK.
1698000	1700000	Let me go back.
1700000	1702000	As I just said,
1702000	1704000	a lot of proteins
1704000	1706000	interplay
1706000	1708000	in this process.
1708000	1710000	Or they appear at different points
1710000	1712000	in different locations.
1712000	1714000	The question is
1714000	1716000	when and
1716000	1718000	where does a protein
1718000	1720000	show up?
1720000	1722000	Everyone who has done cell experiments knows
1722000	1724000	that if you want to see a certain protein,
1724000	1726000	you have to
1726000	1728000	connect your protein
1728000	1730000	to something that emits light.
1730000	1732000	Basically,
1732000	1734000	it's not possible to see
1734000	1736000	dozens of proteins at once.
1736000	1738000	Because there are only four
1738000	1740000	proteins in the entire membrane.
1740000	1742000	You can't see
1742000	1744000	dozens of proteins.
1744000	1746000	How can you see so many proteins?
1746000	1748000	The method everyone uses is to fix
1748000	1750000	the cells and make them into a specimen,
1750000	1752000	and then dye them.
1752000	1754000	What I'm going to do here is the same.
1754000	1756000	Fix the cells and dye them.
1756000	1758000	But at the same time, I want to have
1758000	1760000	some information.
1760000	1762000	I want to know
1762000	1764000	how long it takes
1764000	1766000	for the cell to split.
1766000	1768000	How long does it take for the cell to split?
1768000	1770000	So I did
1770000	1772000	a little trick.
1772000	1774000	It's actually quite
1774000	1776000	ancient.
1776000	1778000	I threw the cells into the environment
1778000	1780000	I wanted them to grow in.
1780000	1782000	Then I used a large area of Brightfield
1782000	1784000	to shoot it.
1784000	1786000	I shot it once every five minutes.
1786000	1788000	At two points in time, the cells split.
1788000	1790000	You can see that there are a lot of numbers here.
1790000	1792000	The target is the cells that split
1792000	1794000	during this process.
1794000	1796000	I recorded these positions.
1796000	1798000	When I fixed the cells,
1798000	1800000	I could know that I killed the cells first.
1800000	1802000	When I made it into a specimen,
1802000	1804000	it was a few minutes
1804000	1806000	or a few hours
1806000	1808000	away from the split.
1808000	1810000	So it's not
1810000	1812000	a full-scale observation.
1812000	1814000	But you can use the cell split as a standard.
1814000	1816000	Then I knew
1816000	1818000	that maybe this cell
1818000	1820000	grew like this after four hours.
1820000	1822000	Or it grew like this after three hours and 45 minutes.
1822000	1824000	So this is
1824000	1826000	to make up for
1826000	1828000	the lack of protein
1828000	1830000	that can't be seen all at once.
1830000	1832000	But one drawback is
1832000	1834000	that I can't actually follow the entire cell.
1834000	1836000	So I made a model
1836000	1838000	from the cell split
1838000	1840000	from 0 minutes to 6 hours.
1840000	1842000	The whole process is not the same cell.
1842000	1844000	I believe that if I collect a little more,
1844000	1846000	maybe it can
1846000	1848000	represent the whole process.
1850000	1852000	Then I used this method
1852000	1854000	to fix the cells and make the dye.
1854000	1856000	I just asked you to remember
1856000	1858000	E-cadherin, ZO1, and protocloxin.
1858000	1860000	The three individuals represent E-cadherin.
1860000	1862000	ZO1 is a type function.
1862000	1864000	Protocloxin is an epico-domain.
1864000	1866000	So you can see the first five-minute
1866000	1868000	picture above.
1868000	1870000	The first one is an XY cross-section.
1870000	1872000	As you can see,
1872000	1874000	protocloxin is actually
1874000	1876000	in the middle of two cells.
1876000	1878000	It didn't run between
1878000	1880000	the two cells
1880000	1882000	in the five-minute cell split.
1882000	1884000	At the same time,
1884000	1886000	in the picture on the right,
1886000	1888000	I turned its perspective
1888000	1890000	to face the cell-to-cell
1890000	1892000	adhesion site.
1892000	1894000	So you can see that
1894000	1896000	ZO1 has probably formed
1896000	1898000	a circular state
1898000	1900000	in the middle of the adhesion site.
1900000	1902000	So it's the same as what I guessed at the beginning.
1902000	1904000	ZO1 is stored there.
1904000	1906000	It feels like
1906000	1908000	the magenta color
1908000	1910000	and the purple E-cadherin
1910000	1912000	domain
1912000	1914000	should be stopped.
1914000	1916000	Because the middle is black.
1916000	1918000	The black part is where the protocloxin is placed.
1918000	1920000	Next,
1920000	1922000	I will continue to look at it.
1922000	1924000	After 30 minutes and 45 minutes,
1924000	1926000	you can see that
1926000	1928000	the protocloxin slowly moves
1928000	1930000	from the cell to the
1930000	1932000	domain in the middle where the
1932000	1934000	protocloxin is.
1934000	1936000	Gradually, it fuses in.
1936000	1938000	As time goes by,
1938000	1940000	rumen is produced.
1940000	1942000	So it's similar
1942000	1944000	to what I guessed at the beginning.
1944000	1946000	Protocloxin was formed
1946000	1948000	at an early stage.
1948000	1950000	Protocloxin is
1950000	1952000	the area
1952000	1954000	to produce the epico-domain.
1954000	1956000	So it's the whole
1956000	1958000	process of mapping
1958000	1960000	that we came to a conclusion.
1960000	1962000	Next,
1962000	1964000	at the later stage,
1964000	1966000	when the whole thing
1966000	1968000	grows into a cyst,
1968000	1970000	we know that it's not a spherical sphere.
1970000	1972000	Its rumen looks very strange.
1972000	1974000	It's not a sphere,
1974000	1976000	it's a flower.
1976000	1978000	We are curious about
1978000	1980000	whether the rumen
1980000	1982000	that it produces
1982000	1984000	will produce rumen.
1984000	1986000	Secondly, what is the shape of the rumen it produces?
1986000	1988000	So I used
1988000	1990000	the cells that killed
1990000	1992000	the two proteins,
1992000	1994000	the cells that don't have protocloxin,
1994000	1996000	to observe for a long time.
1996000	1998000	The number on the left is 905 minutes,
1998000	2000000	about 15 hours.
2000000	2002000	After the cell division,
2002000	2004000	it's about 15 hours,
2004000	2006000	4 hours on the right.
2006000	2008000	So from the previous picture,
2008000	2010000	we know that
2010000	2012000	we will see
2012000	2014000	the epico-components
2014000	2016000	are thrown to that place, ready to be fused.
2016000	2018000	So it's been a long time,
2018000	2020000	more than 10 hours.
2020000	2022000	If it produces rumen, it should be produced.
2022000	2024000	But what's interesting is
2024000	2026000	the blue one is protocloxin,
2026000	2028000	the epico-components.
2028000	2030000	The purple one is e-catechumen.
2030000	2032000	We found that protocloxin
2032000	2034000	stopped where it should stop.
2034000	2036000	It was thrown to that interface,
2036000	2038000	but it didn't seem to be able to fuse
2038000	2040000	with the cell membrane.
2040000	2042000	So the first question is
2042000	2044000	the epico-components
2044000	2046000	were thrown there smoothly.
2046000	2048000	So its polarity
2048000	2050000	was preserved to some extent.
2050000	2052000	If we draw a cross-section
2052000	2054000	and look at
2054000	2056000	the protein distribution
2056000	2058000	on the line I drew,
2058000	2060000	we can see that
2060000	2062000	in the middle,
2062000	2064000	the purple peak is where e-catechumen is.
2064000	2066000	Where catechumen is,
2066000	2068000	there is no protocloxin.
2068000	2070000	In fact, protocloxin should be
2070000	2072000	fused into the membrane.
2072000	2074000	So it should be
2074000	2076000	colloquialized with e-catechumen.
2076000	2078000	But it's not here.
2078000	2080000	So we have a question.
2080000	2082000	OK,
2082000	2084000	there is no tight junction.
2084000	2086000	This delivery
2086000	2088000	still exists, but
2088000	2090000	this protein can't be successfully
2090000	2092000	fused to
2092000	2094000	where it should be fused.
2094000	2096000	So
2096000	2098000	this is still in progress.
2098000	2100000	I haven't
2100000	2102000	collected a lot of data.
2102000	2104000	This amount is not enough.
2104000	2106000	OK, I have a question.
2106000	2108000	Is there a comparison of wild-type?
2108000	2110000	Sorry, say it again.
2110000	2112000	Is there a comparison of wild-type?
2112000	2114000	Is there a comparison of wild-type?
2114000	2116000	There is a comparison of wild-type.
2116000	2118000	If it's wild-type,
2118000	2120000	I'm not prepared today,
2120000	2122000	but I have a comparison of wild-type.
2122000	2124000	If it's a comparison of wild-type,
2124000	2126000	I won't draw this cross-section.
2126000	2128000	Because it's a bit unfair.
2128000	2130000	If it's a wild-type,
2130000	2132000	you can see
2132000	2134000	this page
2134000	2136000	on the left is a wild-type.
2136000	2138000	So you can see
2138000	2140000	there is a beautiful protocloxin in the middle.
2140000	2142000	Then there is a tight junction next to it,
2142000	2144000	which is blue, and then e-catechumen.
2144000	2146000	So I won't draw the cross-section direction
2146000	2148000	I just drew.
2148000	2150000	It will be drawn along the later phase direction
2150000	2152000	of the protocloxin.
2152000	2154000	But I didn't prepare that plot today.
2154000	2156000	But you can see
2156000	2158000	it's a very good colloquize
2158000	2160000	on the layer.
2160000	2162000	So you mean
2162000	2164000	the yellow part
2164000	2166000	is actually with the pink part?
2168000	2170000	In wild-type, no.
2170000	2172000	It should be like this.
2172000	2174000	What I just said is not quite right.
2174000	2176000	Sorry.
2176000	2178000	If it's along...
2178000	2180000	I don't like the mark.
2180000	2182000	So if it's like this on the left,
2182000	2184000	if we draw a line along this purple line,
2184000	2186000	let's just say
2186000	2188000	we draw a line along the purple line.
2188000	2190000	You should see two very high peaks.
2190000	2192000	Then next to it is e-catechumen.
2192000	2194000	Then near the yellow part
2194000	2196000	there will be two very high blue peaks.
2196000	2198000	Then there will be a very large peak in the middle
2198000	2200000	which is yellow.
2200000	2202000	So when you draw this plot along this surface,
2202000	2204000	you will see that
2204000	2206000	all three proteins are on this surface.
2206000	2208000	Then
2208000	2210000	if it's like this case,
2210000	2212000	if it's along this purple line,
2212000	2214000	you won't see the blue line.
2214000	2216000	I just want to emphasize
2216000	2218000	that the blue one can't
2218000	2220000	go to the e-catechumen.
2220000	2222000	I hope this is clear.
2222000	2224000	Oh.
2224000	2226000	So in wild-type,
2226000	2228000	there is no e-catechumen
2228000	2230000	near the protocallicin.
2230000	2232000	Yes, that's right.
2232000	2234000	That's what I mean.
2234000	2236000	OK.
2236000	2238000	Let's continue.
2238000	2240000	I just said that the e-catechumen is removed.
2240000	2242000	In wild-type, sometimes
2242000	2244000	there are very few cells
2244000	2246000	that can't form an e-catechumen ring.
2246000	2248000	It can't
2248000	2250000	form a ring
2250000	2252000	to protect
2252000	2254000	the area
2254000	2256000	that should be protected.
2256000	2258000	So some cells can't form
2258000	2260000	e-catechumen.
2260000	2262000	So I caught these cells.
2262000	2264000	I also drew the plot.
2264000	2266000	So the plot here
2266000	2268000	shows the same thing.
2268000	2270000	There is a purple area.
2270000	2272000	If it goes like this,
2272000	2274000	there should be protocallicin in that area.
2274000	2276000	But now the purple area
2276000	2278000	occupies the yellow area.
2278000	2280000	So whether or not
2280000	2282000	the e-catechumen
2282000	2284000	can form
2284000	2286000	an e-catechumen ring,
2286000	2288000	in the early stage,
2288000	2290000	is a very important thing.
2290000	2292000	But in the later stage,
2292000	2294000	when it grows into a large cyst,
2294000	2296000	it has e-catechumen, for sure.
2296000	2298000	But in the early stage,
2298000	2300000	the mechanism of e-catechumen
2300000	2302000	is different from that of wild-type.
2302000	2304000	So how does it form e-catechumen in the later stage
2304000	2306000	is actually quite interesting.
2306000	2308000	We also want to look at this.
2308000	2310000	This is the result
2310000	2312000	I have obtained
2312000	2314000	for this mapping so far.
2314000	2316000	I haven't collected a lot of data yet,
2316000	2318000	but I should be able to
2318000	2320000	collect some results later.
2320000	2322000	Another thing I want to
2322000	2324000	discuss today
2324000	2326000	is that
2326000	2328000	I just said that
2328000	2330000	the entire e-catechumen
2330000	2332000	is a sphere.
2332000	2334000	So e-catechumen is like a magnet,
2334000	2336000	with a ring around it.
2336000	2338000	In the process of opening the entire e-catechumen,
2338000	2340000	we are curious about
2340000	2342000	how it opens.
2342000	2344000	So I took a picture of
2344000	2346000	this e-catechumen in two cells.
2346000	2348000	It's like a cell on the outside of the screen
2348000	2350000	and a cell behind the screen.
2350000	2352000	The ring of this e-catechumen
2352000	2354000	is a bit like
2354000	2356000	an oscillation
2356000	2358000	in the whole process.
2358000	2360000	It's like a big and small
2360000	2362000	oscillation.
2362000	2364000	So I went to
2364000	2366000	quantize its projected area.
2366000	2368000	As time went by,
2368000	2370000	it did seem to have some oscillation,
2370000	2372000	but it wasn't that obvious.
2372000	2374000	This is what I found recently.
2374000	2376000	I don't have a lot of data
2376000	2378000	to prove that it's really oscillating.
2378000	2380000	But I checked the reference.
2380000	2382000	It's not in
2382000	2384000	MDCK cells,
2384000	2386000	but in liver cells.
2386000	2388000	Someone found
2388000	2390000	a similar oscillation.
2390000	2392000	But you can see that
2392000	2394000	the time scale in the upper right corner
2394000	2396000	is quite different from the time scale in the lower left corner.
2396000	2398000	This may be caused by
2398000	2400000	different cell types.
2400000	2402000	But
2402000	2404000	they also found oscillation.
2404000	2406000	They proposed a physical model.
2406000	2408000	This oscillation
2408000	2410000	can be grown
2410000	2412000	by three mechanisms.
2412000	2414000	The first one is
2414000	2416000	the liquid
2416000	2418000	in it.
2418000	2420000	The liquid slowly
2420000	2422000	fills in and grows.
2422000	2424000	Because
2424000	2426000	e-catechumen
2426000	2428000	has sealed
2428000	2430000	the entire lumen,
2430000	2432000	it doesn't look like
2432000	2434000	a ball of air.
2434000	2436000	When you fill it in,
2436000	2438000	it slowly grows.
2438000	2440000	Another mechanism
2440000	2442000	is to shrink the lumen.
2442000	2444000	Why?
2444000	2446000	Because each cell
2446000	2448000	wants to
2448000	2450000	get farther and farther.
2450000	2452000	If the entire cell
2452000	2454000	is spherical,
2454000	2456000	it has the lowest energy.
2456000	2458000	So there's a mechanism
2458000	2460000	to shrink the lumen.
2460000	2462000	This is the
2462000	2464000	contracellular cortex.
2464000	2466000	Lateral adhesions
2466000	2468000	outside the lumen
2468000	2470000	constantly
2470000	2472000	want to
2472000	2474000	increase the connection
2474000	2476000	between the cells.
2476000	2478000	They want to
2478000	2480000	clear the lumen.
2480000	2482000	These three mechanisms
2482000	2484000	cause the oscillation.
2484000	2486000	But it's not.
2486000	2488000	These three mechanisms
2488000	2490000	don't cause the oscillation.
2490000	2492000	There's an active term
2492000	2494000	which is the shrinkage
2494000	2496000	of the cortex.
2496000	2498000	It's a function of time.
2498000	2500000	Because the lumen grows,
2500000	2502000	it becomes stronger.
2502000	2504000	It causes the oscillation.
2504000	2506000	I
2506000	2508000	personally
2508000	2510000	don't have
2510000	2512000	100% sure about this.
2512000	2514000	So
2514000	2516000	we propose another hypothesis.
2516000	2518000	It's not about
2518000	2520000	the size of the lumen.
2520000	2522000	It's about
2522000	2524000	whether the cortex looks good or not.
2524000	2526000	This is our hypothesis.
2526000	2528000	It needs to be verified.
2528000	2530000	But I think
2530000	2532000	it's possible.
2532000	2534000	The next
2534000	2536000	case is
2536000	2538000	I think
2538000	2540000	I should
2540000	2542000	finish this first.
2544000	2546000	Oh, no. Let me
2546000	2548000	look back.
2548000	2550000	I think it's related to the cortex.
2550000	2552000	One of the reasons is
2554000	2556000	Sorry.
2556000	2558000	OK.
2558000	2560000	If we
2560000	2562000	look at a cyst,
2562000	2564000	it looks like a sphere.
2564000	2566000	When there's or not a cortex,
2566000	2568000	we find something interesting.
2568000	2570000	It's a cyst with a cortex.
2570000	2572000	I label it as
2572000	2574000	P-myosin.
2574000	2576000	P-myosin is a motor protein
2576000	2578000	that makes the cortex shrink.
2578000	2580000	So you can see
2580000	2582000	it doesn't have a strong motor protein.
2582000	2584000	It's only on the outside.
2584000	2586000	But if we remove the cortex,
2586000	2588000	you can see the whole cell
2588000	2590000	has a strong cortex.
2590000	2592000	It makes us think
2592000	2594000	whether there's a cortex
2594000	2596000	is related to the cortex.
2596000	2598000	It's not confirmed.
2598000	2600000	It's not confirmed, but it's not true.
2600000	2602000	It's just my guess.
2602000	2604000	At the beginning,
2604000	2606000	I used green to represent
2606000	2608000	P-myosin and red to represent
2608000	2610000	P-myosin.
2610000	2612000	P-myosin is a certain density.
2612000	2614000	It's a certain density
2614000	2616000	around the P-myosin.
2616000	2618000	Because there's a lot of
2618000	2620000	Because there's a lot of
2620000	2622000	contract R4 in the next two cells,
2622000	2624000	I hope I can reduce the Rumer.
2624000	2626000	Because there's a certain magnitude
2626000	2628000	of the contract R4.
2628000	2630000	Then, because these
2630000	2632000	epico-dom, epico-membrane, epico-dom,
2632000	2634000	epico-component are all being thrown
2634000	2636000	to this place.
2636000	2638000	Because of physicality, the more molecules,
2638000	2640000	they naturally want to expand.
2640000	2642000	At the same time, P-myosin
2642000	2644000	did not supplement in time.
2644000	2646000	The whole is a sphere.
2646000	2648000	So you can see the local P-myosin
2648000	2650000	density is decreasing.
2650000	2652000	Because of this decline,
2652000	2654000	then, at the same time,
2654000	2656000	it's like this.
2656000	2658000	In the whole Lumen growing process,
2658000	2660000	it's like this.
2660000	2662000	This is my personal guess.
2662000	2664000	I haven't verified it yet.
2664000	2666000	I currently have a simple experiment
2666000	2668000	to prove that
2668000	2670000	it's actually
2670000	2672000	contract R4 and
2672000	2674000	P-myosin interplay,
2674000	2676000	not pressure or other mechanisms.
2676000	2678000	Because I added
2678000	2680000	a certain kind of medicine to the cell.
2680000	2682000	The medicine will reduce
2682000	2684000	the contract R4,
2684000	2686000	the contractility between the cells.
2686000	2688000	What I see here is
2688000	2690000	this P-myosin ring did not grow
2690000	2692000	without contract R4.
2692000	2694000	If it is pressure,
2694000	2696000	it should grow automatically
2696000	2698000	because there is no force pulling it back.
2698000	2700000	So it can be seen that P-myosin
2700000	2702000	really confined the whole Lumen.
2702000	2704000	So I think
2704000	2706000	it's not very clear.
2706000	2708000	But this is my guess.
2708000	2710000	OK.
2710000	2712000	To sum up today's summary,
2712000	2714000	the first thing is
2714000	2716000	from my mapping,
2716000	2718000	my idea is that P-myosin
2718000	2720000	at the stage of two cells,
2720000	2722000	it preserves the space
2722000	2724000	where Lumen is produced.
2724000	2726000	So it can produce Lumen later.
2726000	2728000	Next,
2728000	2730000	if there is no P-myosin,
2730000	2732000	it does not affect
2732000	2734000	whether EpicoComponent can be thrown into the interface,
2734000	2736000	but whether it can be fused
2736000	2738000	to the membrane.
2738000	2740000	The third thing is
2740000	2742000	it will cause the dynamics
2742000	2744000	of the whole Lumen,
2744000	2746000	which is an oscillation.
2746000	2748000	Whether it grows well
2748000	2750000	or not depends on
2750000	2752000	the interplay between
2752000	2754000	EpicoComponent and P-myosin.
2754000	2756000	OK. This is my lab.
2756000	2758000	Let me introduce it to you.
2758000	2760000	I have two labs.
2760000	2762000	If there is a result,
2762000	2764000	we hope to build a physical model
2764000	2766000	for the two labs.
2766000	2768000	The lab on the left is my lab.
2768000	2770000	The lab on the right is my lab.
2770000	2772000	I have two bosses.
2772000	2774000	We have this special program.
2774000	2776000	You will have two teachers.
2776000	2778000	They both
2778000	2780000	belong to MPI,
2780000	2782000	but they work in
2782000	2784000	different fields.
2784000	2786000	Time and computational modeling,
2786000	2788000	or time and image processing.
2788000	2790000	We have such a program.
2790000	2792000	So here,
2792000	2794000	we are very close.
2794000	2796000	If you are interested in
2796000	2798000	my institute or have any questions,
2798000	2800000	my email is
2800000	2802000	chwng6601 gmail.com.
2802000	2804000	You can contact me.
2804000	2806000	OK.
2806000	2808000	These are my three institutes.
2808000	2810000	The yellow one is my boss.
2810000	2812000	The middle one is my institute.
2812000	2814000	The right one is my school.
2814000	2816000	OK.
2816000	2818000	Thank you.
2818000	2820000	OK.
2820000	2822000	Before we start,
2822000	2824000	let's applaud
2824000	2826000	and thank our speaker
2826000	2828000	for his wonderful speech.
2832000	2834000	Thank you.
2834000	2836000	Let's start
2836000	2838000	the Q&A.
2840000	2842000	Hello.
2842000	2844000	Hi.
2844000	2846000	I'm Adam.
2846000	2848000	I have a question.
2848000	2850000	There are different
2850000	2852000	size of lumen
2852000	2854000	in human or mammal.
2854000	2856000	What you do is
2856000	2858000	renal.
2858000	2860000	I want to ask
2860000	2862000	if there is any comparison
2862000	2864000	between ZO1 in
2864000	2866000	vascular or renal
2866000	2868000	or various lumen
2868000	2870000	epithelial cell expression level.
2870000	2872000	ZO1 seems to
2872000	2874000	regulate the size of lumen.
2874000	2876000	Right?
2876000	2878000	Personally,
2878000	2880000	I don't do this comparison.
2880000	2882000	But it's difficult
2882000	2884000	to do this.
2884000	2886000	If you know ZO1,
2886000	2888000	you know it's not only in junction.
2888000	2890000	There are many cytoplasmic cells.
2890000	2892000	In my experiment,
2892000	2894000	it's like this.
2894000	2896000	If you want to take out a single cell
2896000	2898000	and run a gene or something,
2898000	2900000	it's a little bit
2900000	2902000	inaccurate.
2902000	2904000	What we are doing now
2904000	2906000	is adding ZO1
2906000	2908000	with click chemistry.
2908000	2910000	It's a detail.
2910000	2912000	We add a tag on ZO1.
2912000	2914000	The tag will be connected by some molecules.
2914000	2916000	We connect all ZO1
2916000	2918000	in the cell,
2918000	2920000	even ZO1 on the membrane.
2920000	2922000	Then we can see the result.
2924000	2926000	But we don't do it in other species.
2926000	2928000	OK. I see.
2928000	2930000	I'm just curious.
2930000	2932000	If you are
2932000	2934000	over-express ZO1
2934000	2936000	in MDCK,
2936000	2938000	what will it look like?
2938000	2940000	If it's
2940000	2942000	a normal amount,
2942000	2944000	you can imagine
2944000	2946000	it's a football.
2946000	2948000	ZO1
2948000	2950000	along the lumen
2950000	2952000	is like a football.
2952000	2954000	If it's a normal amount,
2954000	2956000	you can see it's a little bit straight and crooked.
2956000	2958000	But if you over-express it,
2958000	2960000	you can see it's very crooked.
2960000	2962000	It's like
2962000	2964000	a very strong confine.
2964000	2966000	That's what I think.

2990000	2992000	If you want to know
2992000	2994000	what Project Tyra is doing,
2994000	2996000	I believe
2996000	2998000	if I'm not wrong,
2998000	3000000	you all saw the Facebook announcement
3000000	3002000	and joined today's talk.
3002000	3004000	Tyra actually has a website.
3004000	3006000	You can see the link
3006000	3008000	of Tyra's website
3008000	3010000	under the announcement.
3010000	3012000	And how to join
3012000	3014000	Tyra as a member.
3014000	3016000	Or if you want to share your research,
3016000	3018000	or
3018000	3020000	what Tyra's ultimate goal is, etc.
3020000	3022000	If you're interested, you can check it out.
3022000	3024000	I'll ask one more time.
3024000	3026000	Any other questions?
3028000	3030000	If there are no questions,
3030000	3032000	let's give a round of applause
3032000	3034000	to thank Chen He for his wonderful talk.
3034000	3036000	Thank you.
