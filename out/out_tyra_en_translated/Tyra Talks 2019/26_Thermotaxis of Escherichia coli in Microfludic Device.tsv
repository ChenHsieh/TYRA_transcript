0	2000	They can do this.
2000	6000	Bacteria can get energy source.
6000	8000	So they can do thermotaxis.
8000	11000	This is the result we just showed.
11000	15000	Bacteria will gather at intermediate temperature.
15000	17000	But the temperature they like,
17000	18000	which is the temperature they reject,
18000	20000	will change with the temperature gradient.
20000	22000	Will change with the temperature gradient.
22000	24000	This is our main result.
24000	26000	Of course, we have some control results.
26000	27000	What is the result of control?
27000	28000	For example,
28000	31000	How do we know that bacteria change their preferences
31000	37000	because of temperature gradient?
37000	39000	Maybe they change their preferences
39000	42000	because of temperature range.
42000	45000	The range is different from the gradient.
45000	46000	So we have to make sure
46000	47000	that they don't change their preferences
47000	49000	because of temperature range.
49000	51000	Then we do the following experiment.
51000	52000	For example,
52000	55000	the temperature gradient is originally 59 to 19 degrees.
55000	56000	We change the temperature range,
56000	58000	but maintain the same temperature gradient.
58000	61000	To see if the bacteria are concentrated at a similar temperature.
61000	62000	How do we do it?
62000	63000	We put them at 5 degrees.
63000	66000	From 59 to 19 degrees to 54 to 14 degrees.
66000	68000	In this way, the temperature gradient is still the same.
68000	70000	It's all about 40 degrees difference.
70000	72000	But the average temperature drops.
72000	73000	Right?
73000	75000	Let's see the result.
75000	79000	The red one represents 31 to 48 degrees.
79000	81000	The blue one is 26 to 43 degrees.
81000	82000	Their temperature gradient is the same.
82000	84000	But the temperature range is different.
84000	86000	We will find that the temperature of the bacteria
86000	88000	in the red curve
88000	90000	is about 37 degrees.
90000	91000	37.5 degrees.
91000	94000	The blue one is 37 degrees.
94000	95000	36 to 37 degrees.
95000	96000	So we claim that
96000	98000	although they are not completely overlapping,
98000	101000	their preferences for temperature are similar.
101000	102000	You will find that
102000	104000	there are some systematic differences
104000	106000	on the left and right.
106000	108000	Mainly because
108000	110000	we surround the wall.
110000	113000	These parts are close to the wall.
113000	115000	If they are close to the wall,
115000	117000	there will be a non-linear force
117000	119000	in theory.
119000	121000	But we don't discuss it here.
124000	125000	OK.
125000	126000	Finally,
126000	127000	we have to make sure that
127000	128000	although in theory,
128000	129000	we have calculated that
129000	131000	bacteria need 300 seconds
131000	133000	to complete the environment exploration
133000	135000	in this size.
135000	136000	But it's still a theory.
136000	138000	How do you know it's actually like this?
138000	139000	Right.
139000	141000	So we did one thing.
141000	143000	Before we take data at the end,
143000	145000	we take data in the middle first.
145000	147000	What does it mean to take data in the middle?
147000	149000	After the bacteria enter the temperature
149000	151000	from the beginning,
151000	153000	it takes about 240 seconds
153000	155000	to reach the middle.
155000	156000	That is to say,
156000	157000	let's take a look at
157000	159000	the time given to the bacteria
159000	161000	in 240 seconds.
161000	163000	Is the specific temperature
163000	165000	the same as 360 seconds?
165000	166000	If it's the same,
166000	167000	we claim that
167000	169000	at least between 240 to 360 seconds,
170000	172000	the selection of temperature
172000	173000	has been fixed.
173000	174000	That is, it has reached
174000	176000	the equilibrium state.
176000	177000	This proves that
177000	179000	although there is no complete overlap,
179000	181000	it is qualitatively the same.
181000	183000	At 240 seconds,
183000	185000	they like 31, 32 degrees.
185000	187000	At 360 seconds,
187000	188000	they like 31, 32 degrees.
188000	190000	We choose the steepest temperature
190000	192000	for this temperature gradient.
195000	196000	OK.
196000	197000	That's about it.
197000	198000	Conclusion.
198000	199000	In our device,
199000	200000	because the people before
200000	201000	did a lot of experiments,
201000	202000	but those devices
202000	204000	may not be well-defined.
204000	205000	We want to provide
205000	207000	a well-defined experiment
207000	209000	to make sure
209000	210000	or improve
210000	212000	the research on thermotaxis.
212000	214000	We can create
214000	215000	a very linear
215000	216000	and one drop,
216000	217000	that is to say,
217000	218000	a gradient from left to right,
218000	219000	which is a very simple
219000	221000	temperature gradient.
221000	222000	And this temperature gradient
222000	224000	is very steep.
224000	225000	The nutrients we use
225000	226000	are bacteria that
226000	228000	cannot grow inside.
228000	229000	That is to say,
229000	231000	there is no chemo-attractant.
231000	232000	So there will be less
232000	234000	confounding factors.
235000	236000	Then,
236000	237000	the time we take,
237000	238000	the bacteria need to reach
238000	239000	the equilibrium time
239000	240000	is relatively short
240000	241000	and reasonable,
241000	242000	about 300 to 400 seconds.
244000	245000	Finally,
245000	246000	because of the H-filter,
246000	248000	all the bacteria we take
248000	250000	are all mobile bacteria.
252000	253000	Our conclusion is that
253000	254000	bacteria can be
254000	255000	concentrated in
255000	256000	intermediate temperature.
256000	257000	So it's different from
257000	258000	the previous research.
258000	259000	The previous research found that
259000	260000	bacteria will only be concentrated
260000	261000	in the hottest place.
262000	263000	No matter how you increase the temperature,
263000	265000	it is concentrated in the hottest place.
265000	266000	Because of the relationship
266000	268000	between pseudo-thermotaxis.
268000	269000	But we found that
269000	271000	it can actually be concentrated in the middle.
271000	272000	However,
272000	273000	what is more surprising is that
273000	274000	the temperature they concentrate,
274000	275000	that is, the temperature they like,
275000	276000	will change
276000	277000	with the temperature gradient.
279000	280000	OK, that's it.
280000	281000	Thank you.
281000	282000	Now,
283000	285000	let's see if there are any questions.
286000	287000	Wait a minute.
291000	293000	Let's see if there are any questions.
296000	298000	OK, do you have any questions
298000	299000	for the audience?
313000	315000	Then I have a question here.
315000	316000	Please ask.
316000	318000	I just want to ask
318000	320000	why this experiment
320000	322000	is done with E. coli,
322000	324000	instead of other bacteria.
324000	326000	Oh, that's actually
326000	327000	the reason.
327000	329000	In 1976,
329000	331000	the reason is a bit
332000	333000	very simple.
333000	334000	Because in 1976,
334000	335000	when Maeda did the experiment,
335000	336000	he used E. coli.
336000	337000	And then people
337000	338000	might just want to learn it,
338000	339000	so they used E. coli.
339000	341000	Then I personally
341000	342000	as far as I know,
342000	343000	the other reason is that
343000	344000	E. coli
344000	346000	moves at the fastest speed.
346000	347000	So,
347000	348000	in the same scale
348000	350000	and size environment,
350000	352000	E. coli takes less time
352000	354000	to complete thermotaxis.
354000	355000	So,
355000	356000	this is probably
356000	357000	the main reason for using E. coli.
357000	358000	Because other bacteria
358000	359000	move too slowly.
365000	366000	OK,
366000	368000	so it's possible that
368000	369000	there is research
369000	371000	that allows different bacteria
371000	373000	to move faster?
373000	375000	I don't think so.
375000	376000	It's not like that at the moment.
376000	377000	A lot of people do it.
377000	378000	For example,
378000	379000	yeast,
379000	380000	which is yeast bacteria,
380000	381000	or the larger
381000	383000	thermotaxis for microorganisms.
383000	385000	Or even C. elegans.
385000	386000	But in terms of bacteria,
386000	388000	most people,
388000	389000	I should say all people,
389000	391000	use E. coli.
391000	392000	Just different types.
392000	393000	Like we use 4, 3, 7.
393000	395000	Some people use different types.
396000	397000	Oh.
397000	398000	So, in your field,
398000	399000	you can hold a
399000	401000	bacteria race
401000	402000	to see who can make
402000	403000	their own bacteria faster.
403000	404000	They can't come out
404000	405000	because
405000	406000	their speed
406000	407000	is spread out.
407000	408000	So,
408000	410000	they don't run in a straight line.
410000	411000	Right?
411000	412000	But it depends on
412000	413000	who is faster.
413000	414000	Yeah.
414000	415000	Oh,
415000	416000	OK.
416000	417000	Got it.
420000	422000	Any other questions?
422000	423000	Yang Bo,
423000	424000	I have a question.
424000	425000	OK.
425000	426000	Do you think
426000	427000	that
427000	429000	in your research,
429000	430000	what do you think
430000	431000	is the hardest
431000	432000	or the biggest
432000	435000	challenge?
435000	436000	This is
436000	437000	a good question.
438000	439000	The biggest problem
439000	440000	I encountered
440000	441000	was
441000	442000	the source of our nutrients.
442000	443000	At first,
443000	444000	the source of our nutrients
444000	445000	was something called
445000	446000	lactic acid.
446000	447000	But somehow,
447000	448000	the bacteria
448000	449000	kept gathering
449000	450000	in the hottest place.
450000	451000	So,
451000	452000	we kept thinking
452000	453000	why.
453000	454000	Then we found out
454000	455000	that lactic acid
455000	456000	is a nutrient.
456000	457000	So,
457000	458000	although it is a nutrient,
458000	459000	the bacteria
459000	460000	don't like
460000	461000	too much lactic acid.
461000	462000	Then,
462000	463000	we found out
463000	464000	that
464000	465000	there is
465000	466000	thermophoresis.
466000	467000	That is to say,
467000	468000	if you put lactic acid
468000	469000	in the temperature,
469000	470000	most of the lactic acid
470000	471000	will be concentrated
471000	472000	in the lower temperature.
472000	473000	Right.
473000	474000	Then,
474000	475000	the bacteria
475000	476000	will go to the hotter side
476000	477000	because they don't like lactic acid.
477000	478000	So,
478000	479000	we spent a long time
479000	480000	to change our nutrients.
480000	481000	We changed it to
481000	482000	lactic acid oil.
482000	483000	Because lactic acid oil
483000	484000	doesn't seem to
484000	485000	attract or
485000	486000	exclude bacteria.
486000	487000	So,
487000	488000	it doesn't matter
488000	489000	even if there is a drop.
490000	491000	Then,
491000	492000	the second one is
492000	493000	the measurement of temperature drop.
493000	494000	We used a dye.
494000	495000	But during the measurement,
495000	496000	before we know
496000	497000	thermophoresis,
497000	498000	we will find
498000	499000	the brightness of the dye.
499000	500000	Because the density of the dye
500000	501000	will also change
501000	502000	because of temperature drop.
502000	503000	But we didn't know at the beginning.
503000	504000	So,
504000	505000	the whole measurement
505000	506000	has been inconsistent with the theory.
506000	507000	Then,
507000	508000	when we found out,
508000	509000	everything became
509000	510000	smoother.
510000	511000	About these two points.
512000	513000	Right.
515000	516000	Is it OK?
520000	521000	Dr. Yang,
521000	522000	you mentioned that
522000	523000	no one has used this method
523000	524000	before.
524000	525000	You mentioned it before.
525000	526000	Maybe I didn't hear it clearly.
526000	527000	Yes.
527000	528000	So,
528000	529000	if you are
529000	530000	a reviewer
530000	531000	and you are asked
531000	532000	how to evaluate
532000	533000	this method
533000	534000	compared to
534000	535000	the previous method,
535000	536000	is it better?
536000	537000	Do you have any index
537000	538000	or what kind of measurement?
538000	539000	We
539000	540000	probably
540000	541000	don't have any index.
541000	542000	So,
542000	543000	we
543000	544000	probably use
544000	545000	if it is
545000	546000	in such a situation,
546000	547000	we should say
547000	548000	that
548000	549000	although our devices are the same,
549000	550000	but we use
550000	551000	a smaller magnitude.
551000	552000	It's a very
552000	553000	simple step.
553000	554000	But it's
554000	555000	much better
555000	556000	than before.
556000	557000	There is another
557000	558000	lucky thing
558000	559000	is that the reviewers
559000	560000	didn't ask this question.
560000	561000	So,
561000	562000	we don't need
562000	563000	to answer.
563000	564000	Yes.
564000	565000	But if you want to ask,
565000	566000	we should say
566000	567000	that we have
567000	568000	controlled the magnitude well.
568000	569000	Unlike before,
569000	570000	they used random magnitude.
570000	571000	So,
571000	572000	they caused
572000	573000	some problems
573000	574000	that they couldn't
574000	575000	predict.
575000	576000	Yes.
576000	577000	Thank you.
577000	578000	Yes.
587000	589000	Are there any other questions?
590000	592000	I have a question.
592000	593000	Please ask.
593000	594000	So,
594000	595000	you said that
595000	596000	the biggest contribution
596000	597000	of your research
597000	598000	is to
598000	599000	find
599000	600000	the
600000	601000	right
601000	602000	thermal
602000	603000	test
603000	604000	on
604000	605000	the
605000	606000	right
606000	607000	platform.
607000	608000	Yes.
608000	609000	Before doing
609000	610000	this experiment,
610000	611000	we
611000	612000	already
612000	613000	guessed
613000	614000	that bacteria
614000	615000	like 37 degrees.
615000	616000	We need
616000	617000	someone to
617000	618000	prove this.
618000	619000	But somehow,
619000	620000	there is no way.
620000	621000	What we see
621000	622000	is not like this.
622000	623000	So,
623000	624000	we feel strange.
624000	625000	Is it because
625000	626000	Thermotex's mechanism
626000	627000	and the
627000	628000	thermal test
628000	629000	on bacteria
629000	630000	are exactly the same
630000	631000	as Chemotex's?
631000	632000	So,
632000	633000	before the experiment,
633000	634000	the theory has already
634000	635000	analyzed that
635000	636000	they should like 37 degrees.
636000	637000	There are many
637000	638000	papers on
638000	639000	Thermotex's theory.
639000	640000	But there is no experiment
640000	641000	that can prove this.
641000	642000	So,
642000	643000	we
643000	644000	could have
644000	645000	proved this.
645000	646000	But somehow,
646000	647000	we created
647000	648000	a more complicated problem.
648000	649000	That is,
649000	650000	the temperature
650000	651000	that bacteria like
651000	652000	is related to
652000	653000	the temperature.
653000	654000	But at least,
654000	655000	we can prove that
655000	656000	they do like
656000	657000	the temperature
657000	658000	but not
658000	659000	37 degrees.
659000	660000	But,
660000	661000	we can't prove
661000	662000	that they do like
662000	663000	37 degrees.
663000	664000	So,
664000	665000	we have to
665000	666000	go forward.
666000	667000	Yes.
667000	668000	I have a question.
668000	669000	Hello.
669000	670000	Hi.
670000	671000	I have a question.
671000	672000	I have a question.
672000	673000	I have a question.
673000	674000	I have a question.
674000	675000	Okay.
675000	676000	Please ask.
676000	677000	You said that
677000	678000	the temperature
678000	679000	that bacteria like
679000	680000	is related to
680000	681000	the temperature.
681000	682000	Yes.
682000	683000	Yes.
683000	684000	So,
684000	685000	if we
685000	686000	can prove
686000	687000	that
688000	689000	bacteria like
689000	690000	the temperature
690000	691000	but not 37 degrees,
691000	692000	is there a more
692000	693000	probable reason?
693000	694000	Actually,
694000	695000	there is.
695000	696000	Actually,
696000	696900	I have
696900	697900	explained this
697900	698900	to my boss.
698900	699900	But he didn't
699900	700900	want to add
700900	701900	it to the paper.
701900	702900	But I saw
702900	703900	the reviewer
703900	704900	was also asking about it.
704900	705900	So,
705900	706900	there is.
706900	707900	Let me explain
707900	708900	why it happened.
708900	709900	So,
709900	710900	if you still remember
710900	711900	the pseudo-thermal text
711900	712900	mentioned
712900	713900	at the beginning,
713900	714900	that is,
714900	715900	without the ideal
715900	716900	temperature,
716900	717900	the bacteria will move around
717900	718900	and accidentally move
718900	719900	to the hottest place.
719900	720900	Because the temperature
720900	721900	is high,
721900	722900	the bacteria move
722900	723900	slower.
723900	724900	The temperature is low,
724900	725900	the bacteria move
725900	726900	faster.
726900	727900	So,
727900	728900	the bacteria will
728900	729900	gradually move
729900	730900	to the high temperature.
730900	731900	Let's call this
731900	732900	force 1.
732900	733900	This is the first example.
733900	734900	That is,
734900	735900	somehow,
735900	736900	there is an
736900	737900	invisible force
737900	738900	that pushes the bacteria
738900	739900	from low temperature
739900	740900	to high temperature.
740900	741900	At that time,
741900	742900	I claimed that
742900	743900	if there is another
743900	744900	force,
744900	745900	that is,
745900	746900	there is another
746900	747900	force that pushes the bacteria
747900	748900	from high temperature
748900	749900	to low temperature,
749900	750900	right?
750900	751900	I claimed that
751900	752900	this force
752900	753900	will increase
753900	754900	as the temperature
754900	755900	increases.
755900	756900	But the first force
756900	757900	will not increase
757900	758900	because the temperature
758900	759900	increases.
759900	760900	So,
760900	761900	it's a bit like
761900	762900	when you change the
762900	763900	temperature and temperature,
763900	764900	it's like these two forces
764900	765900	pulling each other.
765900	766900	When the temperature
766900	767900	and temperature
767900	768900	are small,
768900	769900	the phenomenon
769900	770900	of pseudo-thermal text
770900	771900	still dominates.
771900	772900	Then they will
772900	773900	move to the high temperature.
773900	774900	When the temperature
774900	775900	increases,
775900	776900	the bacteria will
776900	777900	start to move
777900	778900	to the low temperature.
778900	779900	But when we
779900	780900	did the simulation later,
780900	781900	we found that
781900	782900	the distribution
782900	783900	is still different
783900	784900	from what we did
784900	785900	in the experiment.
785900	786900	So,
786900	787900	we didn't put it
787900	788900	on.
788900	789900	But I guess
789900	790900	this is
790900	791900	at least
791900	792900	a part
792900	793900	reason.
793900	794900	Is this
794900	795900	OK?
795900	796900	Yes.
796900	797900	OK.
797900	798900	OK.
798900	799900	OK.
799900	800900	OK.
800900	801900	OK.
801900	802900	OK.
802900	803900	OK.
804900	805900	OK.
805900	806900	Thank you.
808900	809900	Hello.
809900	810900	I have a question.
810900	811900	OK.
811900	812900	Go ahead.
812900	813900	Based on
813900	814900	Dr. Yang's
814900	815900	current research,
815900	816900	what do you think
816900	817900	is the next question
817900	818900	you want to
818900	819900	tackle?
820900	821900	Next question?
821900	822900	In fact,
822900	823900	this device,
824900	825900	let me think about it.
825900	826900	There seemed to be
826900	827900	a lot of people at that time.
827900	828900	In fact,
828900	829900	at present,
829900	830900	we are
830900	831900	at the end of
831900	832900	the stage
832900	833900	of research.
833900	834900	But this is
834900	835900	actually very bad.
835900	836900	Yes.
836900	837900	But if you want to
837900	838900	continue to study in the future,
838900	839900	I think the biggest
839900	840900	key should be
840900	841900	like
841900	842900	the question
842900	843900	that my classmate
843900	844900	just asked.
844900	845900	That is,
845900	846900	why do bacteria
846900	847900	choose different
847900	848900	temperatures
848900	849900	under different
849900	850900	temperature scales?
850900	851900	Is it really
851900	852900	the reason
852900	853900	I just guessed?
853900	854900	Or are there
854900	855900	more different
855900	856900	details?
856900	857900	At this time,
857900	858900	we may not
858900	859900	use this
859900	860900	statistical way
860900	861900	to do experiments.
861900	862900	It is more suitable
862900	863900	for experiments
863900	864900	with single bacteria.
864900	865900	That is to say,
865900	866900	you have to focus
866900	867900	on a bacterium,
867900	868900	give it a temperature scale,
868900	869900	and then you have to
869900	870900	trace it.
870900	871900	It's a bit like
871900	872900	recording.
872900	873900	Look at it
873900	874900	in, for example,
874900	875900	a moving state
875900	876900	within 10 minutes,
876900	877900	and then the
877900	878900	direction of the
878900	879900	hair rotation.
879900	880900	Because we can
880900	881900	use that to
881900	882900	determine
882900	883900	whether it is
883900	884900	swing or
884900	885900	tumble.
885900	886900	So it may be
886900	887900	a single cell
887900	888900	study.
888900	889900	That is,
889900	890900	you focus
890900	891900	on the
891900	892900	temperature scale
892900	893900	and see
893900	894900	how it
894900	895900	decides
895900	896900	the final
896900	897900	temperature
897900	898900	over time.
898900	899900	Is there
899900	900900	any other
900900	901900	questions?
901900	902900	Hi,
902900	903900	can I
903900	904900	ask a
904900	905900	question?
905900	906900	That is,
906900	907900	uh,
907900	908900	hello,
908900	909900	hello,
909900	910900	hi,
910900	911900	that is,
911900	912900	I just
912900	913900	saw
913900	914900	that
914900	915900	you said
915900	916900	that
916900	917900	the
917900	918900	temperature
918900	919900	is
919900	920900	higher
920900	921900	than
921900	922900	the
922900	923900	temperature
923900	924900	.
924900	925900	I
925900	926900	want to
926900	927900	ask
927900	928900	that,
928900	929900	but I
929900	930900	think I
930900	931900	may have
931900	932900	missed
932900	933900	it,
933900	934900	that is,
934900	935900	uh,
935900	936900	you mentioned
936900	937900	that you
937900	938900	use that
938900	939900	container,
939900	940900	it is,
940900	941900	uh,
941900	942900	that buffer
942900	943900	is less
943900	944900	interference
944900	945900	than
945900	946900	the
946900	947900	bridge
947900	948900	medium
948900	949900	,
949900	950900	so
950900	951900	it
951900	952900	is
952900	953900	less
953900	954900	interference
954900	955900	than
955900	956900	the
956900	957900	bridge
957900	958900	medium.
958900	959900	So
959900	960900	I
960900	961900	think
961900	962900	that
962900	963900	the
963900	964900	bridge
964900	965900	medium
965900	966900	is
966900	967900	less
967900	968900	interference
968900	969900	than
969900	970900	the
970900	971900	bridge
971900	972900	medium.
972900	973900	So
973900	974900	I
974900	975900	think
975900	976900	that
976900	977900	the
977900	978900	bridge
978900	979900	medium
979900	980900	is
980900	981900	less
981900	982900	interference
982900	983900	than
983900	984900	the
984900	985900	bridge
985900	986900	medium.
986900	987900	So
987900	988900	I
988900	989900	think
989900	990900	that
990900	991900	the
991900	992900	bridge
992900	993900	medium
993900	994900	is
994900	995900	less
995900	996900	interference
996900	997900	than
997900	998900	the
998900	999900	bridge
999900	1000900	medium.
1000900	1001900	So
