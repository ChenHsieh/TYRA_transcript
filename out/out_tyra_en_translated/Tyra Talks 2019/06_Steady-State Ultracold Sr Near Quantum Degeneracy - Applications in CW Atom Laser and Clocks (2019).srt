00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, I'm Ted. I'm very happy to be here today. I'd like to welcome Chen Junjia from the University of Amsterdam.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is his last year at Pomeranian. Yay!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've known him since he was in university. He's also a student at the Electrical Engineering Department.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm very happy to have someone with me to talk about physics.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Junjia is studying Atomic Physics.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I've done a little bit of it in the beginning, but it's a lot different from what I did in IELTS and BEC.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think BEC is very cool in physics.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You've been in this field for over 20 years now, right? How long have you been in BEC?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's been over 20 years since 1995.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, okay.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But it's been a long time since people wanted to do it. It was only made in 1995.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Junjia's topic for today is Steady-State Ultracold Cesium Near Quantum Degeneracy.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He's talking about the application in CW atom lasers and clocks.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
His lab is one of the latest quantum flagships in Europe.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So maybe we can hear some new things and see what Europe plans to do in this area.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I won't say much more. Junjia, please get ready to start your speech.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
First of all, I'd like to thank Jianyuan for giving me the opportunity to introduce the topic I'm doing.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
First of all, I'd like to make a correction. What I'm doing is Strontium, not Cesium.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Strontium is a 2A element.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The purpose of our experiment is, as I said in the title, to achieve a steady-state.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In principle, the ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous atomic laser.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Of course, before you reach that ultimate goal, you have to reach the Bose-Einstein connection in the first phase.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is something that hasn't been achieved yet.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In principle, our lab hopes to challenge it.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In principle, our lab hopes to challenge it.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
As I mentioned in the title, the ultimate goal is to achieve a steady-state.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
In principle, we are already very close to quantum degeneracy.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Of course, we haven't reached it yet.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But in principle, I will briefly report on our current progress.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Of course, I will also mention some applications of CW, Atom Laser, and CLOX on the technology we have developed.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The title is of course our lab, our overall experimental setup.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's take a look.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Of course, we have a step on the experiment.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In principle, we have used some of the cooling mechanisms of CISPOS.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I will briefly introduce it in the next speech.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
First of all, this is the outline of my talk today.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will briefly explain who we are, where we are, and why we want to do these things.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Next, I will briefly mention the technologies we use, such as laser cooling and BEC.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In principle, I will mention two applications that I am more interested in.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Atomic clock and atomic interferometer.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will introduce STROMCM.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In principle, I will also introduce the so-called laser cooling STROMCM to Bose-SanSan condensate.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Next, I will introduce our entire experimental setup.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The three main results are, for example, Ultra High Phase Space Density MOD.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And how do we achieve the principle of Steady State Unity Phase Space Density.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Next, of course, I will introduce one of the cooling technologies we have developed, CISPOS Optical Lattice Decelerator.

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Next, I will give Outlook.

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
First of all, let me introduce myself.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
My master's thesis was originally done in Taiwan.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
My master's thesis experiment.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
In principle, my experiment is to achieve a full optical Rubidium Bose-SanSan condensate.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It is also because of this factor that I am interested in laser cooling.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So when I applied for a doctorate class,

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because when I was a soldier, the English exam preparation was not going well.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For example, I did not pass the TOEFL exam.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then I thought I would come to Europe to do it.

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
At that time, I read some papers when I was studying in the master's class.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know that there is a good team in Innsbruck, Australia.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
At that time, I thought I would try to apply.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Then I applied to Rudy Green's lab.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
At that time, the group I applied to was originally a strong team.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But then my little boss,

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
In principle, it is our actual boss, Florian.

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He later applied for a teaching position to move to Amsterdam.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So I will come to Amsterdam to do it.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There is a very interesting historical source in Amsterdam.

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This person is called Joke Worven.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In principle, at the beginning of BC,

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When you want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation,

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Ordinary people have not yet considered the elements of the EA group.

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation in hydrogen.

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Joke Worven, in principle, his lab in Amsterdam

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Is to do hydrogen cooling.

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then I want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So, in principle, we have some in Amsterdam.

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This kind of laser cooling historical source is right.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Of course, we moved from Australia to Amsterdam.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's also a toss.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In principle, this is our good team in Amsterdam.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
First of all, let me introduce what Bose-Einstein condensation is.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We all know that in principle, W1 material,

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In principle, you can have the nature of the wave,

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can also have the nature of the particles.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Of course, it depends on your temperature conditions.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
To determine some of the characteristics of your wave field.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Of course, we know that under higher temperature conditions,

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In principle, O-nitrogen behaves more like a particle.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When the temperature drops,

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The relationship between W1 and O-nitrogen tells you that

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Its wavelength will gradually increase.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Then you start to use some fluctuations

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
To describe some of the behavior of your particles.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Of course, the closer you get to your condensation temperature,

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The wavelength of your O-nitrogen starts to overlap.

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then you are more and more unable to tell the particles.

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Finally, of course, in theory,

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When T equals zero, you will reach a so-called

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bose-Einstein condensation state.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The picture is basically tested by the MIT team in 1997.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That is to say, they realized that

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let two Bose-Einstein condensations interfere.

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In the experiment, of course, they first realized a Bose-Einstein condensation.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They divided an O-nitrogen into two.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So in the end, two Bose-Einstein condensations were formed.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Then they let it interfere.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Then you will see a very obvious

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Interference of the particle wave.

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
After BC was realized,

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
First of all, it is a particle wave.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If it is a particle wave,

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In the experiment, of course, they will think

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's like a laser.

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They tried to achieve some

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Demonstration of particle laser.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can think of it as

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In principle, it is an optical cavity.

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All the atoms are in a so-called cavity mode.

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You try to get this particle wave

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
After the particle wave comes out of the cavity,

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In principle, they realized some of these particle lasers.

122
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Of course, the current technology in the experiment

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
In principle, it can only achieve

124
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There is no way to achieve a continuous particle laser.

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
In principle, you want to achieve a continuous particle laser.

126
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Of course, you need some

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You have to achieve some first.

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
First of all, you have to have a continuous BC.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
To achieve a continuous BC,

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You have to have some continuous cooling technology.

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Continuous evaporative cooling

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Or some continuous trap loading

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In principle, many people in the past 20 years

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Try to realize it.

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Of course, in the end, they still haven't achieved

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The ultimate goal is a continuous particle laser.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In principle, this is still a very difficult thing.

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The reason why it is so difficult is because

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For example, the conditions for BC to be realized

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
In principle, we all look at this so-called optical cavity density.

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can think of it as

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For the water in the fish tank

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Under low temperature conditions

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It may have already thawed.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In principle, in the process of cooling

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Its density conditions may already

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There is no way to achieve the so-called

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
To achieve the state of BC condensation

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
First of all, we know that BC condensation

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It has this optical cavity density

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It has to reach the condition of greater than 2.6

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Its degree of freedom depends on the relationship with temperature.

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So we know that first of all, my density has to be high enough.

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then my temperature has to be low enough.

155
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But under conditions of high density

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Assuming that your density is too high

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
In principle, the atom will have a so-called

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Loss mechanism

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In principle, it is a so-called three-body recombination.

160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It will form molecules

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
In principle, it is a

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you understand?

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In principle, it is a loss mechanism.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We know that in principle

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The density is almost on this scale.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It is 10 to the 14th square

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So it means that your density cannot be too high.

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If it is too high, your three-body recombination

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
In principle, your atoms will form molecules.

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So your density is almost controlled at 10 to the 14th square.

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That gives a contrast

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In principle, in your air

173
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In principle, your density is almost 10 to the 19th square.

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So you can say

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
In principle, we are doing cold matter

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
When the cold atom is studied

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The density of the atom group we are talking about

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
In principle, it is thin

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's 10 to the 14th square.

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's 10 to the 14th square.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
To reach this Bc condition

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Its corresponding temperature is almost at this level.

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
1μK to 10 nK level

184
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is a very cold principle.

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That is to say

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's why it's called an ultracold atom.

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Because it compares with other temperature scales.

188
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Our cold atom is almost in this range.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Compared with other Earth's room temperature conditions

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
300K here

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We are at about 7 or 8 numbers

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A temperature condition below

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The current realization

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
In principle, it is because of the restriction of cooling technology.

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We can only achieve the so-called

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The so-called Maltese-Boson condensation

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You need to have the first stage of laser cooling in the experimental technology.

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then evaporate the cooling

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
When you reach Bc

200
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You try to put the atom group inside

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
After the alcohol comes out

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Of course, you will later

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
After using up the atom group in the trap

204
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Then you have to do another experiment.

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Re-create the Boson condensation

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So on the experimental technology

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You can only achieve the so-called Maltese-Boson condensation.

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Of course, the continuous Boson condensation

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Or continuous material laser

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Has always been in the field

211
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
A goal that everyone wants to achieve

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But even after 20 years of effort

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There is still no way to achieve it.

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Has not been achieved yet

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Of course, we use laser cooling in the experiment.

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Then I will briefly explain

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Some mechanisms of laser cooling

218
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
First of all, the atom

219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
First, we know that the atom interacts with the light.

220
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Take a look

221
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Sorry

222
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
First of all, the atom is electrically activated.

223
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There is a principle

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Resonant light

225
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It absorbs a light corresponding to the quantum frequency.

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The atom will be activated

227
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Then there will be a transfer of momentum

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Of course, after releasing the light back to the atom

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There will be a transfer of momentum

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The principle of laser cooling is based on this mechanism

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
To interact with the atom through light

232
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
To do a deceleration action

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Of course on the experimental level

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Through this mechanism

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We want to take the atom from

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
For example, this is our source

237
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You throw a piece of metal into the oven

238
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Heat it up

239
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It will be vaporized

240
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Of course, vapor pressure corresponds to

241
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
For example, you heat it up

242
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
For example, on our experiment, we put it at 500 Kelvin.

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So it's basically

244
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Sorry, 500 degrees C

245
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then it will have a corresponding 500 degrees C

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The speed distribution of Boltzmann distribution

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How to interact with the atom through light

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
To decelerate this speed distribution

249
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In principle, on the experiment

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We also use a so-called Zeeman Slower

251
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Zeeman Slower is mainly through

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Atomic under magnetic field conditions

253
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It is a connection to the magnetic field

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Change

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
On the principle of our laser

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
In the picture, you see the principle

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
On the experiment, we will go around a circle

258
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Create a T-magnetic field

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This T-magnetic field

260
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It corresponds to

261
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
When my light and atom are in this position

262
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Corresponding magnetic field

263
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It creates

264
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It meets the conditions

265
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It interacts with the atom

266
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It has a momentum shift

267
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It decelerates

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So the atom is decelerated

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Then in the next position

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Because my magnetic field has a T-magnetic field change

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm in the next position

272
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
My magnetic field conditions

273
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
To find a way to maintain this

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Light and atom interaction

275
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Under constant conditions

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
My atom group

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
After this Zeeman Slower

278
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
After a deceleration

279
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
In principle, in the back

280
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Can put my entire atom group

281
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Its speed distribution

282
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That is to say, a deceleration action

283
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The principle of this experiment is

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The overall experimental structure

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
For example, I have an oven

286
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Is my heating

287
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Heat the metal block

288
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Area of ​​generating steam pressure

289
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Then this is my Zeeman Slower

290
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Then finally

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I want to be in this place

292
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Do a state of atom capture

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This is just a general

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
A standard

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
A pulse-injection-like

296
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm just making an example now

297
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's take a look

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
In the experiment, of course, we finally

299
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Is in

300
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Do an atom capture

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Let's take a look

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Sorry, don't jump

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That just said

304
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
After the atom capture

305
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The technology used in the atom capture

306
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
For example, the last area

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Will put the so-called six lasers

308
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Six lasers in space

309
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
In principle, you can put

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Atomic group in all directions

311
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Do a deceleration action

312
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Of course, in the experiment

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We add a magnetic field

314
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
To be able to do a so-called

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Spatial confinement

316
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Then I'm here in principle

317
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Just skip it first

318
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
In the principle of laser cooling

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In the next step

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It is necessary to enter the evaporation cooling

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The reason is because

322
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In the process of laser cooling

323
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Your laser cooling will have a so-called

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Laser cooling corresponds to a

325
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Cooling temperature limit

326
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The cooling temperature limit

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Mainly you can understand it as

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
When all your atoms

329
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
After being cooled

330
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It will get higher and higher

331
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But because

332
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You are absorbing the cooling light

333
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The next step is to release the cooling light

334
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Release a spontaneous emission

335
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Then the light released

336
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Because the density of the atomic group is very high now

337
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It may be further

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's a bit like heating the atoms around you

339
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The reason is because the density is very high now

340
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So it corresponds to a

341
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Laser cooling corresponds to a

342
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Cooling temperature limit

343
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So in principle

344
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
At the end of the experiment

345
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
After this laser cooling step

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Will do an evaporation cooling action

347
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The evaporation cooling action

348
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
General technology now

349
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Of course there is the so-called magnetic field

350
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Is to put the atomic group

351
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Put it in a magnetic track

352
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Or light

353
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Did you use light in the experiment?

354
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Let me explain a little bit

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What is the overall mechanism of light?

356
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We all know that the atom

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There will be one in the power plant

358
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Will be polarized

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Then this

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It will have a spontaneous

361
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Electric dipole

362
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
In principle

363
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Suppose I use light today

364
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
To produce a so-called

365
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
AC electric field

366
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Then my atom in principle

367
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Will be

368
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Induced dipole moment

369
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
In principle, its power plant is produced by light

370
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Then he knows

371
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because of this

372
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
In the light field

373
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Its dipole moment

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
In principle, it will

375
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because of the power plant

376
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Sorry

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
For example, we are using light now

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
To produce a light field

379
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That light field because

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
In principle, the light field

381
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I produce this

382
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Trap his

383
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It is determined by its intensity

384
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That is to say, I assume

385
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Today light is a Gaussian beam

386
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It has an intensity distribution

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
In principle

388
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
This dipole moment

389
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
To induce

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
In this light field

391
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
For this intensity distribution

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You will have the so-called

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Assuming

394
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The atom is in the light field

395
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Suppose I have this light today

396
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
For it

397
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
If I am a

398
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Redshift

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It means

400
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I assume my wavelength

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Than the wavelength of the light I use

402
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If the wavelength of my atomic quantum frequency

403
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If it's still long

404
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We call it

405
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
In principle, it is called

406
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
In this light

407
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
In principle

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This light field is called

409
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Red Dipole Trap

410
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Red Dipole Trap

411
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
In principle, it is said

412
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
My atom will be concentrated

413
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
To a higher intensity

414
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Area

415
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Compared to

416
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Assuming the wavelength of the light I use today

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
If the wavelength is still short

418
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The overall

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The characteristic of the light produced is that

420
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
My atom will be concentrated

421
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The lower part of the intensity

422
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That

423
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Just a little bit here

424
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Demonstrate

425
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Atomic group

426
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Some interactions with light

427
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
In the experiment, of course, we are

428
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
After generating the so-called magnetic light

429
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Open my Red Dipole Trap

430
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Then it is

431
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
In principle

432
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You will see

433
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The atomic group is

434
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Leaked into the Red Dipole Trap

435
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That

436
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This is just to show that

437
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
After opening the Red Dipole Trap

438
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I go

439
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That is

440
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Just open

441
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
0 ms

442
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
10 ms

443
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
20 ms

444
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That my atomic group

445
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
One

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Atomic group

447
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Leaked into the Red Dipole Trap

448
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
One

449
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Behavior like this

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
In the experiment, of course, we reached

451
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That is to say, the atomic group

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Leaked into the light

453
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Then we need to evaporate and cool in the light

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That evaporate and cool

455
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The concept is very simple

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
After the hot atom leaves

457
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Overall

458
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The remaining atoms will go through again

459
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
One

460
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Thermalization process

461
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
At the end

462
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Of course, the overall temperature will drop

463
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That

464
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Evaporate and cool

465
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Next

466
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Evaporate and cool

467
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
When the temperature is getting lower and lower

468
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
After reaching the critical temperature

469
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You will see one

470
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Atomic group

471
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The process of phase transformation

472
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That

473
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Here

474
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is a

475
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
At the end

476
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Evaporate and cool

477
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Then the radiation freezes

478
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
One

479
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This is a whole

480
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
A phase transformation

481
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
One

482
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Demonstration

483
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That

484
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
In

485
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Evaporate and cool

486
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He

487
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
How do you judge

488
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Your substance has passed

489
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Is already

490
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Reached the evaporation and cooling state

491
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That

492
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
In the experiment, we will

493
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Through

494
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
For example, I am looking at this

496
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Atomic group behavior

497
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That

498
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
For example, we are now

499
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Here is the

500
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Uh release

501
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Then the atomic group will be in the gravity field

502
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It will fall under the conditions

503
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That

504
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Let's do an image action

505
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That

506
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Atomic group

507
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
In principle, it assumes

508
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If it is still thermal gas

509
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
He is in

510
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Uh

511
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You will see that in principle it is a

512
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Isotropic expansion

513
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
One behavior

514
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That

515
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Assuming he is today

516
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If it reaches the evaporation and cooling state

517
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That

518
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
In principle, you will see a

519
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So-called

520
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Anisotropic

521
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Expansion behavior

522
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That this is with

523
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You can understand it

524
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That is to say

525
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Uh

526
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
For example, if you have a

527
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Elongated

528
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Cloud

529
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That in

530
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
He is in

531
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
After you release the

532
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He is in the gravity field

533
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Falling

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That

535
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He was originally

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Strong

537
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Strong confinement

538
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
On the axis

539
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
His

540
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He is stronger

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So he will

542
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
In the process of release

543
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
In principle, it will grow faster

544
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
He will have

545
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It also leads to

546
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He will have this

547
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So-called

548
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Anisotropic expansion

549
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
A phenomenon

550
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That this is

551
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
In principle, our

552
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
A smoking gun

553
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That is to say

554
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
As long as we have reached BC

555
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
That in principle

556
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We are going to

557
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Find this

558
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Anisotropic expansion

559
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
To determine that we have reached

560
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The state of BC

561
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That of course

562
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
1995

563
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
BC was realized for the first time

564
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That

565
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Next

566
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
In 2001

567
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I got the Nobel Prize

568
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That

569
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So far

570
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Uh

571
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Someone

572
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Have a question

573
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Want to ask

574
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That is to say

575
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm just a little bit

576
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Laser cooling

577
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That

578
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So far

579
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Someone has a question

580
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Hello

581
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Hello

582
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I want to ask

583
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That

584
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You will be sure

585
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's you

586
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Inside this

587
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Or your BC

588
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
How many

589
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Or how many

590
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
For you

591
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Because

592
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Sometimes there will be

593
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
He is like

594
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
His number should be

595
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's all changing

596
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Uh

597
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Uh

598
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So

599
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I

600
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I

601
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I

602
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I

603
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I

604
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I

605
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I

606
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I

607
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I

608
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I

609
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Uh

610
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Uh

611
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Uh

612
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Of course

613
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
We experiment

614
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
For example, you see this picture now

615
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That we are

616
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Do

617
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Uh

618
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Assortment imaging

619
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's basically

620
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
To go back

621
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
How many of its atoms are there

622
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like this

623
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This picture

624
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Uh

625
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Uh

626
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Of course I can't guess now

627
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But

628
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Almost

629
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Look at this condition

630
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
There are about 10 5-quarters

631
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
10 6-quarters

632
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The number of atoms

633
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
On the experiment

634
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Of course we will

635
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Will calculate

636
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But

637
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Uh

638
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
For example, we are now on the experiment

639
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I want to reach the continuous Bohr's law

640
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Can be imagined

641
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
At the beginning

642
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The number you reach

643
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Not so much

644
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It's possible

645
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
10 3-quarters

646
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
10 4-quarters

647
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So

648
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But he has a corresponding condition

649
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That is to say

650
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Uh

651
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The number

652
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Also with your

653
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The temperature of the ring

654
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It has something to do

655
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That is to say

656
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You have to reach

657
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So many

658
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Uh

659
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Bohr's law

660
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Your

661
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You have a corresponding ring temperature

662
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That's right

663
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So

664
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
On our experiment

665
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Of course, we have to find a way

666
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Condition

667
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That is to say

668
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I want my system to be able to

669
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Cold to such a low temperature

670
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That

671
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
At that temperature

672
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
How much density do I have to reach

673
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
To have a way

674
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
To cross that

675
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Condition of phase space density

676
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Greater than 2

677
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That is

678
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Uh

679
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
N lambda 3-quarters

680
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Greater than 2.6

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This condition

682
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
In principle

683
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm going to adjust this

684
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Density

685
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
With temperature

686
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
That whole person

687
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
To have this

688
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Satisfy this condition

689
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I have a way to

690
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
To reach the Bohr's law

691
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So

692
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Uh

693
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't know if this answers your question

694
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Hey, it's okay

695
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You go ahead

696
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We

697
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I have some questions later

698
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'll ask you again

699
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
OK

700
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Technical questions

701
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll ask you again

702
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Hey, hello

703
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That one

704
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The one in the first video

705
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's gone

706
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's your head now

707
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh really

708
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Hey

709
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Do you see your desktop

710
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Or am I seeing yours now

711
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
OK

712
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I see

713
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's okay to continue

714
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
OK

715
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Uh, I have a question

716
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Let me introduce us

717
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That

718
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
OK

719
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Uh, sorry

720
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I just want to ask

721
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That is

722
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Uh

723
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
What is it called

724
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That is

725
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You want to produce

726
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
CW

727
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The

728
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Bose Einstein Converter

729
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That is

730
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You can let that Bose Einstein Converter

731
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Keep going

732
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So

733
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
My question is

734
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That is

735
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Under what circumstances

736
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That is

737
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Under what circumstances

738
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Why won't it last

739
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
OK

740
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
How long does it last

741
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
How long

742
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Let me find the video

743
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Uh

744
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
How long

745
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
In principle

746
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
On top of time

747
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Is

748
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You mean

749
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It has an infinite duration

750
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What I just said

751
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It has an infinite duration

752
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It has an infinite duration

753
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It has a time limit

754
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It has a time limit

755
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That time limit

756
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That time limit

757
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes yes

758
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yes, that's right

759
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That time limit

760
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
In principle

761
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It depends on your experimental technology

762
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You have to go through the laser cooling first

763
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And then the next step

764
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Evaporate and cool

765
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Finally reach the Boltzmann fission

766
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That

767
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But in principle

768
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Your entire system

769
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You will have a

770
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Uh

771
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Loss

772
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Or you're doing atom

773
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Outcouple your atom

774
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Outcouple your atom from your BC

775
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
After your atom comes out

776
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That you

777
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
In the end

778
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You still use up all the atoms

779
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So that means

780
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You're in the experiment

781
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Re-create the Boltzmann fission

782
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So that's because of this

783
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Restriction, so

784
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
In the experiment

785
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You will

786
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You

787
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Your Boltzmann fission

788
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Or your atom laser

789
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Is

790
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There will be a

791
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Uh

792
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's a soldering

793
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Because you're going to run out of atoms

794
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That experiment

795
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Is to achieve

796
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That is to say

797
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Continuous

798
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That is to say

799
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Your Boltzmann fission

800
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Continuous

801
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Boltzmann fission

802
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Continuous

803
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That side

804
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That is to say

805
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He basically

806
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Assuming I

807
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
If I keep

808
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What do you mean

809
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If it's

810
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That is

811
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That usually we

812
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The last step is

813
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Outcouple

814
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
That BEC

815
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Then you can measure

816
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Correct

817
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That if

818
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You keep outcoupling

819
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That BEC

820
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Just

821
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Won't it be there all the time

822
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Uh

823
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Is because

824
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You have to know

825
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
In vacuum

826
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
He still has a so-called

827
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Background collision

828
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
He

829
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Your

830
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You have a BEC

831
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
He's in

832
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Under vacuum

833
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
In your

834
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Inside the trap

835
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
He will still

836
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
There is a

837
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Background collision

838
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
A loss caused

839
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
In principle

840
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You can imagine

841
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
His lifetime

842
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
In principle

843
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Under the best vacuum condition

844
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
In principle

845
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's about 30 seconds

846
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Uh

847
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
After 30 seconds

848
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Your atom

849
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
In principle

850
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
After a series of

851
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Background collision

852
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
In the end

853
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's gone

854
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So

855
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
On the experiment

856
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You have to start again

857
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Re-create

858
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
A wave

859
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Out of vacuum

860
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So

861
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
OK

862
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yes

863
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There is a

864
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Background collision

865
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Result in

866
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You have a whole

867
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
A loss

868
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Uh

869
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
OK

870
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Good to know

871
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
it is good

872
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Thank you

873
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That

874
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
On the experiment

875
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We are doing strong

876
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Strong

877
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
With

878
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Uh

879
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Different elements of the 2A group

880
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Of course, he has two

881
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Add electrons

882
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That

883
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It corresponds to the electronic connection

884
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Different from the 1A group

885
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
In

886
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He has so-called

887
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Singlet

888
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
With triplet states

889
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That

890
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
First of all, we all know

891
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
In the 1A group

892
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You make these atomic keys

893
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That is

894
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
In principle

895
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
He will meet

896
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Some so-called

897
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Selection rule

898
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That

899
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
In the 2A group

900
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Because he has a triplet state

901
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That

902
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Atomic keys from singlet to triplet state

903
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
In principle

904
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Not satisfied

905
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Selection rule

906
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That is to say your

907
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Delta s

908
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Not equal to 0

909
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
In principle

910
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
This is

911
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Selection rule

912
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Not allowed

913
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But of course

914
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Because

915
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Some

916
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Coincidence mechanism

917
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
For example

918
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
For example

919
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
In this 3P state

920
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
He

921
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
He and

922
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
This state

923
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
1P1

924
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
In principle, there is a coincidence

925
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That

926
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In principle

927
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
He will indirectly

928
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
With

929
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Ground state couple

930
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
To

931
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So he

932
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Overall

933
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This key

934
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
He

935
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Still allowed

936
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
That

937
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But the answer he corresponds to is

938
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Because he

939
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Uh

940
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
He corresponds to the key

941
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Is allowed

942
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But he corresponds to the width of the line

943
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Relatively narrow

944
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That

945
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
This is

946
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
A level scheme of strong

947
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Then we see

948
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
For example

949
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
In

950
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
First left is

951
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Singlet state

952
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Right is triplet state

953
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That

954
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Singlet state inside

955
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
This

956
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This

957
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Is what we use

958
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Mainly laser cooling

959
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
He corresponds to the width of the line

960
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
In principle, it is

961
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
30.5 MHz

962
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That

963
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Triplet state is our second stage

964
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Laser cooling key

965
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That

966
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
His line is relatively narrow

967
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That

968
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Because I just mentioned

969
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Is

970
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
He

971
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Selection rule

972
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
This is a

973
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Forbidden transition

974
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But

975
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
He

976
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
In principle, it is

977
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He corresponds to

978
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
In principle, he

979
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
In principle

980
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Not completely forbidden

981
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So he corresponds to

982
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Is a

983
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Transition of the width of the line

984
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He corresponds to the width of the line

985
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Transition

986
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
He is on the laser cooling

987
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Allow you to reach

988
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Lower

989
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Cooling limit

990
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So

991
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Use this

992
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Uh

993
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
To do laser cooling

994
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
He can reach

995
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
A lower temperature

996
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That

997
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
He has some

998
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Features

999
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
This

1000
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Metastable state

1001
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I will introduce later

1002
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I am

1003
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We use it

1004
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
For example

1005
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Uh

1006
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
In general

1007
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Poisson

1008
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Poisson

1009
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Inside

1010
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
He can be used

1011
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Accumulate my atomic group

1012
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That is to say this is a

1013
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Lifetime

1014
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Long

1015
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
State

1016
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I can put the atom

1017
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
In principle

1018
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Concentrated in this state

1019
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
To do

1020
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Uh

1021
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Accumulated action

1022
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That

1023
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
His

1024
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Ground state

1025
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Mentioned here is that

1026
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
No

1027
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Magnetic

1028
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Magnetic

1029
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
No

1030
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Electronic

1031
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Magnetic Moment

1032
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So

1033
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
My

1034
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Atomic atom

1035
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Originally in

1036
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I can't use

1037
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Because he doesn't have

1038
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Magnetic Moment

1039
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So I can't use

1040
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Magnetic to capture him

1041
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Also limited to say

1042
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Is

1043
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I have to use light in the experiment

1044
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Instead of magnetic

1045
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That

1046
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This is the reason

1047
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
He doesn't have

1048
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Magnetic

1049
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Magnetic Moment

1050
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That

1051
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Current stage

1052
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Strong

1053
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The experiment

1054
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
In principle

1055
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Uh

1056
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm here

1057
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
There are many principles

1058
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
For example

1059
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Ultra cold

1060
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Inside the atom

1061
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Want to

1062
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
We have it in the lab

1063
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
For example

1064
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We want to do

1065
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Ground state

1066
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That

1067
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
There is also a strong

1068
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Two molecules

1069
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And

1070
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
For example

1071
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Now

1072
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Very

1073
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Red

1074
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
For example

1075
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Quantum gas microscope

1076
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Want to

1077
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
In principle

1078
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
We want to do

1079
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
High resolution

1080
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
That is to say

1081
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
High resolution on the experiment

1082
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
One

1083
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Uh

1084
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
To observe the atomic group

1085
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Some

1086
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Uh

1087
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Experiment

1088
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Or say

1089
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
For example

1090
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Use magnetic atoms to do atomic interference

1091
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And

1092
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The next thing I'm going to introduce is

1093
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Use magnetic atoms to do superradiant laser

1094
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That

1095
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
There are many

1096
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That

1097
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm more interested in

1098
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
For example

1099
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Let's do the atomic group

1100
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That

1101
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We all know now

1102
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Atomic group

1103
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Now use color atoms

1104
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
To do

1105
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That

1106
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Uh

1107
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Time definition

1108
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That

1109
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
In fact, this is with color atoms

1110
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Hyper

1111
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Uh

1112
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Ground state

1113
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Hyperfine state

1114
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
To do a

1115
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Uh

1116
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Time standard

1117
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That

1118
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Color atoms

1119
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Ground state

1120
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Hyperfine state

1121
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Transition

1122
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Almost

1123
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
In

1124
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Uh

1125
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Gigahertz level

1126
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It seems

1127
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
There are

1128
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
More than nine gigahertz

1129
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That

1130
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Of course

1131
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
We all know that

1132
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Some of it

1133
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Uh

1134
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Then I'm on the right side

1135
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
A list of

1136
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Relationship

1137
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We know that this

1138
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
His

1139
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Accuracy

1140
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
In principle

1141
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Is with

1142
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Screen

1143
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
His uncertainty

1144
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Is related to his frequency

1145
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That

1146
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
From this relationship

1147
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
We know that

1148
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Your center frequency

1149
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
For example

1150
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Ccm

1151
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It corresponds to

1152
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The frequency is in the gigahertz level

1153
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That

1154
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Of course they are on the time

1155
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I hope to put this frequency

1156
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The higher the higher the better

1157
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Because

1158
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
This way

1159
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
This one

1160
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
His

1161
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
The error can be

1162
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Or

1163
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
His

1164
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Uncertainty can be smaller

1165
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Because you imagine

1166
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
For example

1167
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I put

1168
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
He from gigahertz

1169
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Back to

1170
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Terahertz

1171
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That

1172
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This one

1173
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The denominator is super big

1174
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That he overall

1175
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I

1176
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Error of hertz

1177
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Corresponding to an uncertainty

1178
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
His

1179
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Fraction is smaller

1180
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That

1181
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
In addition, we know that the number is in principle

1182
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The more atoms, the better

1183
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That's why the experiment

1184
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The glasses are in the light

1185
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
This piece

1186
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
They want to go from gigahertz

1187
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
To

1188
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Light to push

1189
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Push to terahertz

1190
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
That of course

1191
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Uh, the first one

1192
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Light

1193
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The candidate is, for example, ion trap

1194
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Because ion, for example, ion

1195
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
He has some

1196
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Ion corresponds to

1197
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Uh, for example, clock transition

1198
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That is to say, you can

1199
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Uh

1200
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He corresponds to the clock transition

1201
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Can be used as your time standard

1202
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
But

1203
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Uh

1204
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Uh

1205
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The first generation of ion trap, of course

1206
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
He trapped an ion

1207
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So in this number

1208
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
He is relatively

1209
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Weak

1210
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's why

1211
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
In

1212
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The new generation, of course, other people have other proposals

1213
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
For example, to do optical lattice clock

1214
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Of course he is

1215
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The more traps, the better the atoms

1216
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That optical lattice clock

1217
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
He also uses atoms

1218
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Also use the atomic clock state

1219
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
In terahertz level

1220
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And then he has to trap a lot of atoms at the same time

1221
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Go to this

1222
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Pull up

1223
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That overall makes the whole

1224
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Uh

1225
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The accuracy is higher

1226
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That

1227
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So state of the art

1228
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Of course it is

1229
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The night army in Gila

1230
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
What he achieved now, of course, is

1231
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The Fermi gas clock

1232
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Uh, Fermi gas clock

1233
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That of course

1234
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
His this

1235
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Now on the experiment

1236
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Uh, the principle is

1237
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Almost at 10 to 18

1238
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
10 to 18

1239
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Of course this is

1240
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
This is listed here

1241
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The night army

1242
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
He

1243
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
In his speech, it is often mentioned that

1244
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Assuming that he can achieve it in today's experiment

1245
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
One

1246
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Uh, Fermi gas principle is

1247
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
There are 1 million atoms

1248
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
That his

1249
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Uh, he has a way to reach this

1250
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Uh

1251
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Accuracy in light

1252
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
A value of 10 to 20

1253
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
At the same time, of course

1254
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
In Gila

1255
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
They also have another one

1256
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Uh, the approach on the experiment

1257
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
For example, it is

1258
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
James Thompson, his super radian laser

1259
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The principle is

1260
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Uh

1261
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Generally, we

1262
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
In the experiment of the night army, he

1263
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Atoms are his

1264
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
His

1265
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
A substance of detection, of course, is

1266
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
To find a way

1267
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
He also has to go through a local

1268
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
For example, he wants to do a very good laser

1269
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And then through this laser

1270
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
His

1271
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Made of atoms

1272
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So the atom as a whole

1273
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
In his experiment, this is a

1274
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Uh

1275
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
He needs a very good clock laser

1276
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And then to probe his

1277
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Uh

1278
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
What is it called

1279
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Atoms are his

1280
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Absorber

1281
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Just

1282
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Atoms are his

1283
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
A substance of observation

1284
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So the overall

1285
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Your light is a so-called passive

1286
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Clock because you are

1287
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You have to use a very good

1288
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Laser to observe your

1289
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Sample

1290
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
James Thompson's approach is basically different

1291
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
He just wants to let the atoms

1292
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Go by yourself

1293
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Release the light of this clock transition

1294
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
His experiment is

1295
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Put the atom

1296
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Put it in a cavity

1297
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Then let him

1298
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
A super radian effect

1299
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
That's the last

1300
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The light you come out of

1301
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
In principle

1302
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Uh

1303
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's determined by the atom

1304
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Not by you

1305
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Cavity conditions

1306
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
To decide

1307
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So the experiment

1308
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
He is now

1309
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Make a

1310
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Super radian laser

1311
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That

1312
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Because this super radian laser

1313
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
He is basically

1314
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Clock state

1315
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
3P0

1316
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
His

1317
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Uh

1318
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Minihertz

1319
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
They are now

1320
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Super radian laser

1321
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
That

1322
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
They are the same

1323
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Two experiments

1324
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
To make a

1325
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
To measure

1326
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Super radian laser

1327
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
How accurate it is

1328
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So

1329
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
James Thompson put his

1330
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Super radian laser

1331
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Optical lattice clock

1332
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
To make a

1333
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Beat note

1334
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
To measure

1335
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Uh

1336
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
His super radian laser

1337
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Conditions

1338
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Of course they are now

1339
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
About 10 to 15

1340
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That

1341
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
James Thompson

1342
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
He also wants to do

1343
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Super radian laser

1344
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
That

1345
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Super radian laser

1346
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
On this number

1347
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Push down three

1348
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That means

1349
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Usually in this kind of light

1350
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Uh light experiment

1351
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You have to measure his

1352
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Uh you do the points

1353
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That is to say

1354
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You measure light

1355
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
You

1356
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Uh

1357
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
In principle, the accuracy

1358
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The longer you measure

1359
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Uh

1360
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The higher the accuracy is

1361
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
In the light

1362
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
In the experiment

1363
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
If you do it in a row

1364
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You

1365
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
In this super radian laser

1366
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
You are one second

1367
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
In principle, you can reach 10 to 18

1368
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
One of the four

1369
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Conditions

1370
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That means

1371
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
James Thompson gave himself a metaphor

1372
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
For example, you put this light

1373
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
His super radian laser

1374
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You are

1375
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Uh

1376
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
In principle

1377
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Assuming that the conditions of CW

1378
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You can reach this level

1379
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That is

1380
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Of course another

1381
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Uh

1382
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
The application of double-sided tape is of course

1383
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Used on atomic interference

1384
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Then we all know that atomic interference

1385
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Uh

1386
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It can be used to measure your acceleration

1387
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It can be used to measure the gravitational field

1388
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It can be used to measure

1389
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Uh

1390
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Your rotation

1391
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
In principle, it has a very high accuracy

1392
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That

1393
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
In the experiment, of course

1394
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
His

1395
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Sensitivity

1396
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
With

1397
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You in your

1398
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
For example

1399
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You can

1400
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
On the basis of the atomic group

1401
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You let him do

1402
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
The longer the time

1403
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Or your

1404
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Your two atomic groups

1405
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Just

1406
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
The greater the distance

1407
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Your sensitivity will be higher

1408
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So

1409
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Now on the experiment, of course

1410
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
They take this thing

1411
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Want to do

1412
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
For example

1413
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Or

1414
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Gravity wave detector

1415
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
First of all, I must say

1416
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
This is the atomic interference

1417
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
One of them

1418
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Quite interesting application

1419
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But I don't do this myself

1420
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I can only say

1421
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
On the basis of technology

1422
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Tell you a little bit

1423
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Now there are principles

1424
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
In this regard

1425
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
There are other teams doing

1426
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
For example

1427
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
On the gravity wave

1428
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
On the detector

1429
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Atomic interference

1430
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
In principle, he has a way to make up

1431
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Other gravity wave

1432
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Detector

1433
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
For example, now

1434
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
There is a LIGO on the experiment

1435
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
His detection wavelength is here

1436
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
That next

1437
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Proposed

1438
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Lisa to sit in space

1439
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
In principle, his detection wavelength is here

1440
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
There is actually a gap in the middle

1441
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
This gap can be in principle

1442
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Atomic interference to make up

1443
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
His advantage is

1444
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
We all know gravity wave

1445
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
He's going to measure this

1446
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Chirping

1447
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
When two

1448
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
He finally

1449
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
For example, your gravity wave

1450
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Source, he finally

1451
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
In the process

1452
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Your measured gravity wave

1453
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
In principle, the frequency will be higher and higher

1454
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But

1455
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You experiment

1456
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
At this frequency

1457
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
If you have a detector

1458
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
His advantage is

1459
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
You can

1460
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
You are in a gravity wave

1461
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Before the event

1462
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You can go through

1463
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
For example, our atomic interference

1464
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
After measuring the signal

1465
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
He can go first

1466
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Position in space

1467
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Let you know

1468
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
For example, your LIGO

1469
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You can expect

1470
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
There will be a gravity wave

1471
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
You can measure

1472
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Of course

1473
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Through this atomic interference

1474
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Because he's in

1475
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
The frequency he corresponds to

1476
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He

1477
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Measured gravity wave

1478
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The lifetime of the event will be longer

1479
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
For example, he is

1480
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
0.01 hertz

1481
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
To 10 hertz

1482
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So you basically

1483
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You can

1484
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
He corresponds to

1485
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
For example, you measure

1486
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The event

1487
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It takes a few months

1488
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
He means

1489
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
In the measurement process

1490
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
In space

1491
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The source of your gravity wave

1492
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
That

1493
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Of course you can

1494
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
With other

1495
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
For example, LIGO

1496
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Then

1497
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It's on some satellites

1498
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It seems to be measuring

1499
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Electromagnetic wave

1500
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Of

1501
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The principle

1502
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It means

1503
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You go to measure this gravity wave

1504
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Of

1505
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You can match other

1506
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Detector

1507
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So reach the so-called multi-messenger

1508
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
One

1509
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Measurement

1510
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Of course you have to be able to do multi-messenger

1511
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It means

1512
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You have to know where he is

1513
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Those detectors on the satellite

1514
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
For

1515
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Measure in that direction

1516
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So

1517
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Atomic interference

1518
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Can provide information

1519
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Of

1520
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Of course

1521
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
At Stanford

1522
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Do some

1523
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Of

1524
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
They first built a 10-meter

1525
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Atomic interference

1526
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
That

1527
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Of course they also reached the so-called

1528
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Of

1529
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Of

1530
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
The material wave

1531
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Of

1532
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Can reach 54 cm

1533
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That

1534
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That means

1535
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
They also achieved some

1536
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
On both sides

1537
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Some early experiments in the gravity field

1538
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
For example, in this experiment

1539
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Their

1540
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
In principle, your atomic group

1541
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Is

1542
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
He went to throw different heights

1543
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That he experimented

1544
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
In principle, here is a

1545
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
For example, an 80-kilogram

1546
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Piece

1547
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Then

1548
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
They went to measure this

1549
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Throw the atomic group at different heights

1550
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
To scan this

1551
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
In principle

1552
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Gravity field

1553
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
This result

1554
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
In principle, it is a

1555
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Demonstration that your

1556
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
In principle, you can measure

1557
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
A change in the gravity field

1558
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Of course

1559
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Of

1560
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Their next experiment

1561
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Of course, I want to scale up

1562
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I want to do, for example, 100 meters

1563
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Then

1564
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
They want to do it with a private atom

1565
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Because private atoms

1566
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Some

1567
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
In the past

1568
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
For example, he first had a

1569
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That he experimented

1570
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
He can reach

1571
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Higher accuracy

1572
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So

1573
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
This is a private atom

1574
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
In the next few years

1575
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
On gravity

1576
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Detector

1577
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
A

1578
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Competitive application

1579
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
That

1580
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Then we experimented

1581
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Then we do

1582
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Our ultimate goal is to do

1583
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Then

1584
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
We have a way to produce

1585
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
The so-called

1586
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Continuous

1587
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Assuming we have a way to produce

1588
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Continuous Boson-Einstein connection

1589
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Continuous

1590
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
In fact, on the experiment

1591
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
We also have

1592
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Continuous

1593
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So this is

1594
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Mainly in our

1595
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Want to do

1596
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Several plans

1597
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
That

1598
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I think I might be a little too slow

1599
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
A little

1600
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Speed up

1601
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Then we experimented

1602
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Just mentioned

1603
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
To achieve continuous

1604
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Laser cooling

1605
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
That just said

1606
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Laser cooling and evaporation cooling

1607
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
On the experiment

1608
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Not compatible

1609
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
The reason is because

1610
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Laser cooling has a laser cooling temperature limit

1611
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That next stage

1612
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You just want to put the atomic group

1613
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
To

1614
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
To the

1615
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Put the atomic group to

1616
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
For example, we use the

1617
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Inside and then inside

1618
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Evaporation cooling

1619
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
At the same time you want to

1620
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Turn off the laser cooling light

1621
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
The reason is because the laser cooling is used

1622
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Originally

1623
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Resonant light

1624
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
At the same time

1625
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
In the cooling process

1626
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Resonant

1627
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
That is to say

1628
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Resonant light

1629
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
If there is a way

1630
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
If there is a way to stimulate the atomic light

1631
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That

1632
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Your atomic principle

1633
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Is constantly heated

1634
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So in the evaporation cooling process

1635
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We must turn off the laser cooling light

1636
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That

1637
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Of course

1638
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
That is

1639
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
You can't do it on the experiment

1640
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
To achieve a so-called continuous

1641
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
A

1642
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Because these two cooling steps are incompatible

1643
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But

1644
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
In 2013, our lab

1645
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
The principle is

1646
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Did an experiment

1647
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That

1648
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
There is a way to achieve

1649
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
That is to say we are completely

1650
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
No evaporation cooling

1651
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We only rely on laser cooling

1652
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
To achieve Boson-enzyme condensation

1653
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
That

1654
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Of course

1655
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Here is the introduction

1656
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We put it on the experiment

1657
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
That is the so-called transparency beam

1658
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I just talked about the laser cooling

1659
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
The source of the cooling limit

1660
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Because

1661
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
When the density is higher

1662
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Your laser cooling light

1663
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
In the process of re-release

1664
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It will heat up your atom

1665
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
That

1666
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
In the experiment, we go through this

1667
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We call it transparency beam

1668
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
We find a way to let the atom

1669
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
To my laser cooling light

1670
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
In principle

1671
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Become transparent

1672
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That is to say, my atom can't see my laser cooling light

1673
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
That

1674
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Through this

1675
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Transparency beam

1676
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
A little trick

1677
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Then we have a way to achieve

1678
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Only by laser cooling

1679
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
To achieve Boson-enzyme condensation

1680
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That

1681
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Its mechanism is actually quite simple

1682
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That I am now

1683
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
In principle

1684
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
In the film

1685
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
In my light well

1686
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
That

1687
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
At the same time

1688
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I have my laser cooling light

1689
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Is in this

1690
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Um, use this

1691
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Laser cooling light

1692
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That its laser cooling

1693
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
The cooling limit is in principle

1694
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Corresponding to

1695
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Doppler temperature

1696
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
In principle

1697
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Doppler cooling temperature is about

1698
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
180 nK

1699
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Doppler temperature is about

1700
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
About 500 nK

1701
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So

1702
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Its laser cooling light corresponds to

1703
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
The temperature limit is actually very low

1704
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So

1705
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
My group of atoms in principle

1706
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
In the light well

1707
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Through laser cooling

1708
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Can reach

1709
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Almost

1710
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
1 uC

1711
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
That

1712
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
That's why

1713
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
To reach such a low temperature

1714
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Mainly just mentioned

1715
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Those

1716
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Um

1717
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Your

1718
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Atoms will still have this

1719
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Reabsorption of light

1720
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Being heated

1721
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The state

1722
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Of course, we use this

1723
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Transparency beam

1724
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Let me

1725
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Excited state

1726
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
This light is in principle

1727
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Address my

1728
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Excited state to another state

1729
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
That

1730
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The reason for this light

1731
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Because of this light

1732
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
My excited state

1733
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Its state is

1734
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So-called

1735
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
AC star shift

1736
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That

1737
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Because of this light

1738
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
My atom is in this

1739
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Position

1740
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It

1741
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Uh

1742
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Excited state

1743
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Light shift

1744
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So

1745
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It can't

1746
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
In principle

1747
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
My light will not

1748
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Interact with this atom

1749
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
My light will not

1750
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Interact with the group of atoms in this position

1751
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
That

1752
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Of course we are

1753
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
My

1754
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
The group of atoms is in my dipole trap

1755
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Then

1756
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Right

1757
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
What you see is the distribution of the group of atoms in principle

1758
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Let's say I open my

1759
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Transparency beam

1760
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'm also doing

1761
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Uh

1762
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Imaging

1763
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Because

1764
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Sorry

1765
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Let me say it again

1766
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
This

1767
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Absorption imaging

1768
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Transition

1769
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You can see the overall distribution of the group of atoms in principle

1770
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
There is one in the middle

1771
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
In principle, the density is higher

1772
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Because I have this

1773
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Dimple relationship

1774
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Now I open my transparency beam

1775
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Because

1776
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
In this position

1777
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It

1778
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Excited state

1779
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Light shift

1780
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
That is to say

1781
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Shift

1782
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So my

1783
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
This beam of light

1784
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
In principle, in this position

1785
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
There is no way to interact with the atom

1786
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So you are doing the same

1787
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
When imaging

1788
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Use this beam of light

1789
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The group of atoms is in this position

1790
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It

1791
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's with this

1792
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
This beam of light is in principle

1793
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It's not fair

1794
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So it's in principle

1795
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
In principle, there is no way to interact with those atoms

1796
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
So you are in

1797
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You can't see it in the image

1798
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That

1799
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Of course, the experiment

1800
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Through this

1801
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You can imagine

1802
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
My laser cooling light

1803
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
In

1804
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Reservoir

1805
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It continues to cool my laser

1806
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
That

1807
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
In

1808
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Dimple

1809
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Because of my

1810
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Transparency beam

1811
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Protect my atom

1812
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So in principle, the atom

1813
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Will not be these

1814
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Light

1815
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Do not interact with these lights

1816
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
That experiment

1817
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Laser light is constantly

1818
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
In

1819
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Reservoir

1820
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Then

1821
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
At the same time

1822
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
In my dimple

1823
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
If you don't interact with these lights

1824
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
That my

1825
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
In dimple

1826
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
The density is high enough

1827
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The temperature is low enough

1828
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
He has a way to form Boson

1829
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
That's why the experiment

1830
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
On the right side of the picture

1831
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
In principle

1832
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
We hit it in the experiment

1833
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Through

1834
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Laser cooling

1835
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
To achieve Boson

1836
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
That whole process

1837
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
We did not do an evaporation

1838
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Cooling

1839
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
That

1840
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
This experiment

1841
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
When this experiment is completed

1842
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Of course we want to go further

1843
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
The so-called continuous

1844
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Atomic laser

1845
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Because now

1846
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
To achieve Boson

1847
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We are completely free

1848
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
We completely skipped the evaporation

1849
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Cooling

1850
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
That experiment

1851
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
To achieve the so-called continuous

1852
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Atomic laser

1853
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That

1854
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Of course

1855
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Just introduced

1856
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
That is to say

1857
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
On the experiment

1858
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
My laser cooling evaporates

1859
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That experiment

1860
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Of course

1861
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I am evaporating

1862
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
In the process of laser cooling

1863
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I just ignored

1864
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That is to say

1865
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
We do laser cooling on the experiment

1866
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
There are two laser cooling stages

1867
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
First of all

1868
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
In principle, there is the first one

1869
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The so-called blue mark

1870
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
That is to say, use this laser cooling light

1871
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
To do the first stage of cooling

1872
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Then

1873
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Use this

1874
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Thinner light

1875
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
To reach a lower temperature

1876
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
That

1877
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Then

1878
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
This Transparency Beam

1879
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
In principle, it can protect my atom

1880
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Let it

1881
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Not interact with this laser light

1882
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But on the experiment

1883
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
We still need

1884
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
The first stage of laser cooling

1885
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
To accumulate my atomic number

1886
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
To reach a lower temperature

1887
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
To accumulate my atomic number

1888
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
To reach enough atoms

1889
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
To do the second stage of cooling

1890
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That is to say

1891
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
There is a two-stage laser cooling

1892
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Step

1893
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And my

1894
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Transparency Beam

1895
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Only in the second stage

1896
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It works in the laser cooling process

1897
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
But on the experiment

1898
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
We still need the first stage

1899
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Laser cooling light

1900
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So

1901
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Next

1902
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
We are going to do

1903
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Continuous

1904
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Uh

1905
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Polaris

1906
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Or continuous atomic laser

1907
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The second stage

1908
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Uh

1909
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Light we can pass

1910
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
This Transparency Beam to protect my atom

1911
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
But

1912
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
The first stage of laser cooling light

1913
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
We experiment

1914
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
In principle, it is

1915
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Let

1916
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Uh

1917
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
In another space

1918
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Go to

1919
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Finish my first stage of laser cooling

1920
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Then the atom

1921
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
In principle

1922
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
To the second space

1923
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
To achieve my so-called continuous

1924
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Polaris

1925
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Of course

1926
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
This is our experiment

1927
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Is

1928
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
After the atom came out of the oven

1929
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The first stage

1930
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Uh

1931
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
What we use is what we just said

1932
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Uh

1933
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Uh

1934
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Do the first stage of laser cooling

1935
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Next

1936
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Then

1937
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
In this chamber above

1938
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
This 30

1939
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Megahertz

1940
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
To do

1941
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Uh

1942
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Uh

1943
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
After the atom came out of the oven

1944
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
My atomic number is essentially

1945
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
To

1946
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
The following chamber

1947
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Go

1948
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
To achieve my

1949
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Continuous Polaris

1950
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
That space

1951
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
In this area

1952
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
In principle, it is completely

1953
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Uh

1954
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
With my first stage of laser cooling

1955
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
The space is separated

1956
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
That experiment

1957
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
In the middle of the chamber

1958
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Of course there is also this

1959
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Uh

1960
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
In principle, it is to avoid some

1961
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Scattering light

1962
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Scattered blue photon

1963
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Go to the following chamber

1964
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That

1965
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
First of all

1966
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
This is our general chamber design

1967
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
That

1968
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
We are

1969
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Just do

1970
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
All the first stage of laser cooling

1971
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Achieve

1972
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
The atomic number is running

1973
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
To the following chamber

1974
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
That

1975
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
In the following chamber, we are essentially

1976
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
No blue light at all

1977
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
We use the so-called

1978
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Uh

1979
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
To reach a lower temperature

1980
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Of course

1981
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
We want to have

1982
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Uh

1983
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
We first achieve

1984
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
First make a

1985
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
After that

1986
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
The atomic number is essentially

1987
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
In because this

1988
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Is a 2D

1989
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
So it's on the axis

1990
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
In principle, the atomic number can be

1991
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Run up and run down

1992
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The atomic number running down

1993
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
We are

1994
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
In principle

1995
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Through a molasses

1996
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
To cool

1997
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Let the overall atomic number

1998
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Uh

1999
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Increase

2000
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
That

2001
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
At the same time we are

2002
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It's a bit like

2003
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Put two blue push pins

2004
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
To

2005
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Avoid the atomic number

2006
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Run up

2007
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You are

2008
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
In

2009
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The following chamber

2010
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Atomic number

2011
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Relatively higher

2012
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That

2013
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Uh

2014
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
As I just said

2015
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
But we have to achieve a series of

2016
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
4BEC and

2017
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
In the atomic laser chamber

2018
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
We don't need blue light at all

2019
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
That

2020
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
The red light used is essentially

2021
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Corresponding to

2022
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Uh

2023
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
On the surface

2024
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Because it is

2025
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Only 7.4 kHz

2026
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
The bandwidth

2027
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Corresponding to

2028
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
In principle, only

2029
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
About

2030
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
10

2031
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
15

2032
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Gravity acceleration

2033
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So it's actually a very

2034
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Inefficient

2035
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Speed reduction

2036
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Of course we are

2037
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
In principle

2038
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Put this

2039
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
7.4 kHz

2040
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The bandwidth we want to do

2041
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Frequency broadening

2042
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
To make it overall

2043
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Acceleration

2044
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
That is to say

2045
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
To have a way

2046
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Uh

2047
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
For example, I'm from the top

2048
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Chamber

2049
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
The atomic number it corresponds to is a

2050
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
6 mps

2051
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
A

2052
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Speed limit

2053
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
That

2054
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Of course we have reached

2055
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Uh

2056
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
At least the first stage

2057
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
In practice, we can't reach

2058
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Steady state red mod

2059
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
That steady state red mod is essentially

2060
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
The first one in practice

2061
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Through

2062
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Continuous

2063
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Use

2064
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
7

2065
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
7.4 kHz bandwidth

2066
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
To achieve

2067
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
A mod condition

2068
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
That it

2069
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
In principle

2070
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
We have just reached

2071
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Uh

2072
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
First

2073
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I just started talking about it

2074
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
We have a way

2075
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
In space

2076
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
In different spaces with different

2077
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Laser cooling

2078
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
In this framework

2079
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
In principle, it is realized

2080
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Blue laser cooling on the top chamber

2081
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Red laser cooling on the bottom chamber

2082
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
A condition

2083
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
That

2084
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Of course

2085
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
In practice

2086
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
We put

2087
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Mod center

2088
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Pull

2089
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Uh

2090
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Side by side

2091
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
The main reason is because

2092
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
If you make a mod here

2093
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
He will still see

2094
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Blue scatter light

2095
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
So

2096
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Through

2097
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
My

2098
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Mod center moved to the side

2099
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
After

2100
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Can reach a lower temperature

2101
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
On the experiment

2102
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
At the same time, of course

2103
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I'm here

2104
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
On this condition here, I reached one

2105
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
On the experiment

2106
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Continuous

2107
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
One

2108
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Atomic sample

2109
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
On the experiment, I tried to

2110
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Produce a pulse-like

2111
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Scatter light connection

2112
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Then use this

2113
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Scatter light connection

2114
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
To measure

2115
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
My lifetime

2116
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
The point is

2117
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I have a BEC here

2118
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Then I use this BEC

2119
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Then at the same time I turn on my blue laser cooling light

2120
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm going to measure my BEC lifetime

2121
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Then through this step

2122
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I'm going to make sure

2123
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
In this experiment

2124
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I'm here

2125
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
He won't be

2126
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
This place

2127
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Laser cooling light

2128
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
That

2129
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
We're going to measure his lifetime

2130
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Almost unchanged

2131
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
So

2132
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So in this experiment

2133
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
We're sure

2134
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
My experiment

2135
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
My

2136
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
The origin of this place

2137
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Will not be above me

2138
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Blue laser

2139
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Cooling photon

2140
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Then we try to

2141
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Characterize my

2142
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
A condition

2143
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Then we found out that

2144
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
The mass produced here

2145
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Its space density

2146
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
With all the previous

2147
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Experiment to compare

2148
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
We have a principle

2149
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
100 times

2150
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
That is, we compare

2151
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
All the previous

2152
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Steady state

2153
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Compared to the conditions

2154
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Our mass

2155
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
At least 100 times

2156
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The increase in the number of space density

2157
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
This is our principle

2158
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
The first piece of paper

2159
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Junjia

2160
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Hello

2161
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I'm sorry because it's a little over time

2162
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You probably still

2163
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
How long are you going to talk about

2164
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Because we usually talk about an hour

2165
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Yeah

2166
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Take a look

2167
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So if you feel

2168
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I think everyone is by the way

2169
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
There's something wrong with you

2170
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
To a stage

2171
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
If you think it's a paragraph

2172
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
That's it for today

2173
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Let everyone come

2174
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Please ask questions about your content

2175
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Like this

2176
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Okay

2177
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I'll talk about it for another ten minutes

2178
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
In principle

2179
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Because in the first experiment

2180
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
We reach the principle

2181
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
100 times

2182
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
The increase in the number of space density

2183
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
But

2184
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
We still can't do it in time

2185
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
The wave is very condensed

2186
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Then we have the second experiment

2187
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
In principle

2188
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Is

2189
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
In principle

2190
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
In principle

2191
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
In principle, we have a red mark here

2192
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Then we

2193
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Put the red mark

2194
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Continuously exposed to our DiploTrap

2195
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Inside

2196
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
My principle

2197
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Is that you can run through

2198
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
On the right

2199
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
A DiploTrap

2200
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
One condition

2201
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Then

2202
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
He also continues to use

2203
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
After these tricks

2204
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
We have a way

2205
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
A continuous

2206
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
A loading

2207
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Then finally

2208
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
In this place

2209
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
This is my

2210
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I want to produce my one here

2211
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
SteadyStateBEC

2212
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
In SteadyStateBEC

2213
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
In principle

2214
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
We have to use this isotope

2215
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
To realize

2216
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
In principle

2217
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
To reach

2218
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
In principle

2219
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
We have now reached

2220
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
The condition

2221
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
That is far from our goal

2222
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
In principle

2223
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
We are now in the same number

2224
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So

2225
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Of course we are now

2226
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
The next step is to hope

2227
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Of course

2228
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
We now have a new way to cool

2229
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Because

2230
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
In terms of here

2231
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I have a Zeeman SlowerBeam here

2232
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Is our one deceleration mechanism

2233
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Then we found that this deceleration mechanism

2234
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
In principle

2235
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It will heat up again in the experiment

2236
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
The source here

2237
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So

2238
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
We have

2239
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Develop a new deceleration method

2240
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
In the new experiment

2241
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
In principle, we are going to use this new deceleration method

2242
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I hope I can go further

2243
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Try to put this

2244
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
The density of the phase space

2245
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Increase

2246
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
In the end, of course, I hope I can reach

2247
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Continuous BC

2248
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So

2249
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I think I may have talked too long

2250
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
In principle, this is our current state

2251
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
In principle, this is our current state

2252
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
So

2253
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
To do a brief summary

2254
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
In principle

2255
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
In our new experiment

2256
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
We hope to reach

2257
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
In space

2258
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Separate these two different cooling

2259
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Laser cooling

2260
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Step

2261
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
In the experiment

2262
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
We have a new experiment

2263
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
We built a new experiment

2264
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
That reached the first stage

2265
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
High Phase Space Density

2266
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
A condition

2267
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And then try to realize

2268
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Continuous

2269
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
In principle

2270
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
DipoleTrapLoading

2271
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And finally reach a

2272
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Space density

2273
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
A state

2274
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I just talked about

2275
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
In this part

2276
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Deceleration mechanism

2277
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
We found

2278
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
There is a heating effect on our atomic group

2279
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
So we

2280
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Try to develop new

2281
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
That is to say different

2282
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Deceleration mechanism

2283
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
In the new experiment

2284
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Hope to try to break through this

2285
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
The density of the phase space is now

2286
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
A bottleneck

2287
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Once

2288
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
In principle, we have a way

2289
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Achieve continuous

2290
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Deceleration

2291
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
That's about it

2292
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Hello

2293
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Power

2294
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Power

2295
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Hello

2296
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Did you hear

2297
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Hello

2298
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Hello

2299
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Ok

2300
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Thank you for the speech

2301
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
That

2302
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Now

2303
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Is there anything about the speech?

2304
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
No problem

2305
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Welcome to open questions

2306
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
How many people are there now?

2307
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Just

2308
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
There are about nine in the peak period

2309
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I think

2310
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It's a bit too hard

2311
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
to talk about it later

2312
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Then

2313
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I think

2314
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Everyone wants to hear

2315
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
There are some applications

2316
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
in the middle

2317
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Like you said, like gravity

2318
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That

2319
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Or other things

2320
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
What are the conditions

2321
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
that need to be met

2322
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
You say you are close to them

2323
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Almost the same number

2324
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
How long do you expect

2325
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Will be completed

2326
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Or within two or three years

2327
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Is it like this?

2328
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
In principle, our experiment now

2329
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Of course it is

2330
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Put

2331
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
New

2332
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Speed ​​limit

2333
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Applied to the experiment

2334
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
That

2335
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
In principle, I will do it again

2336
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Then this time

2337
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
My speed limit

2338
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Instead of using

2339
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Radiation pressure force

2340
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I will use it now

2341
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
My new speed limit

2342
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
That

2343
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Briefly introduce

2344
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
My new speed limit

2345
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
In principle

2346
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Is me

2347
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
In principle

2348
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Let the atom go

2349
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I am on my excited state

2350
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
To produce a

2351
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Potential landscape

2352
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Then once my atom is

2353
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
After being stimulated

2354
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Its energy

2355
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Is through this excited state

2356
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Potential landscape

2357
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It's climbing this

2358
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
On the excited state

2359
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
A process

2360
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
To take the energy

2361
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So this is

2362
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
In principle, it is my new speed limit

2363
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
That experiment

2364
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I hope I can avoid this

2365
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Speed ​​limit

2366
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
To heat up

2367
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
My atomic group

2368
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
But at the same time

2369
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It won't

2370
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
To affect

2371
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I

2372
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Atomic group

2373
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
A temperature

2374
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So the new experimental principle is

2375
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I hope to prove this as soon as possible

2376
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
That is to say

2377
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
My new speed limit

2378
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It won't affect me

2379
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Final

2380
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
This is in

2381
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Atomic group inside

2382
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Then because it won't heat it

2383
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
So hope

2384
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Also in density

2385
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Temperature conditions

2386
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Under the conditions

2387
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
To achieve my continuous

2388
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Potential landscape

2389
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
That

2390
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
At least two more experiments

2391
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
About two months

2392
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
That hope

2393
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
In principle

2394
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Almost tested

2395
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That

2396
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Is to be able to

2397
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Try to answer this question

2398
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Under the new speed limit

2399
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I have no way to achieve my

2400
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Continuous potential landscape

2401
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Thank you

2402
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Hey, can I ask another question?

2403
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Is a little

2404
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
More

2405
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
General

2406
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
That is

2407
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Why did you choose

2408
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Is this strong?

2409
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And you just mentioned

2410
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Use his

2411
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Red number

2412
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
That

2413
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Red number

2414
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
The use of

2415
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
The same number of conditions

2416
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Is

2417
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Here

2418
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
There are different numbers

2419
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
For example, strong

2420
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That

2421
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
You have to reach bc

2422
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You

2423
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Your

2424
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
He has one

2425
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
At least

2426
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
This

2427
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Decide

2428
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
There is no way

2429
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Uh

2430
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Go

2431
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Do effective

2432
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Thermalization

2433
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Because you have to do

2434
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Your

2435
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
To do a heat balance

2436
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Condition

2437
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
That

2438
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Because his

2439
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Very low

2440
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So he

2441
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Can't see each other

2442
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
So

2443
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Your cooling process

2444
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
You don't have a so-called

2445
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Heat balance

2446
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So when you're cooling

2447
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
He's hard

2448
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Uh, the first one

2449
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's hard to go

2450
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
The second one is

2451
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So low

2452
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And it's almost negative

2453
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
In fact, there's no way

2454
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Uh, stable

2455
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
So in practice

2456
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Even this

2457
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
His

2458
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Very high

2459
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
But because of this

2460
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
He's not a

2461
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Easy to reach bc

2462
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The same number

2463
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
So that

2464
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That's too high

2465
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So he's easy

2466
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Once he's

2467
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
He's

2468
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
He's too high

2469
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
He

2470
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
In principle, the heat balance is too fast

2471
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And then

2472
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
It can even cause heating

2473
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That

2474
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
He just happened to be

2475
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
A very friendly

2476
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That

2477
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
So in practice, we're going to

2478
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
84

2479
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
84

2480
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Want to achieve

2481
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
That

2482
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Uh, why

2483
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
The main reason is also

2484
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Mainly because

2485
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Um

2486
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
He

2487
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
The first stage

2488
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Laser cooling

2489
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So I can do very effective

2490
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Laser cooling to

2491
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Fast

2492
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Uh

2493
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Accumulate atoms

2494
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Because he has his second stage

2495
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Laser cooling

2496
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
First

2497
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Width

2498
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
It won't be too narrow

2499
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
So I can still use it to do some

2500
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Uh, uh

2501
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
The first one is wide enough

2502
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So I can do laser cooling to very low temperature

2503
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
That

2504
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Can reach very low temperature

2505
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
That

2506
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Because of that 2013

2507
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
We

2508
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Laser cooling to bc

2509
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
It's a mechanism of transparency

2510
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Go

2511
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
To achieve the so-called full light

2512
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Laser cooling

2513
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Uh

2514
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Boomerang

2515
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Completely skipped

2516
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
The step of evaporation and cooling

2517
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
So that experiment

2518
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
The double line becomes

2519
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
The most likely

2520
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Achieve continuous

2521
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Boomerang

2522
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
A element

2523
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
So in principle

2524
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So we will choose private atoms

2525
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Mainly because of our experiment

2526
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Is

2527
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Start with private atoms

2528
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
So

2529
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
This

2530
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
There is a reason to choose him

2531
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Ah

2532
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Is it

2533
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
The 2A group

2534
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
All can

2535
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Up and down

2536
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Everyone uses private atoms

2537
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
That

2538
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Is there a heavier one?

2539
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Also

2540
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
If you can't reach it

2541
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Change to a unified group

2542
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
You can do it

2543
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Or maybe

2544
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
There is no way

2545
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
A lot of people doing AMO

2546
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Looking at the laser

2547
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Can you get used to it?

2548
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Or can you buy it?

2549
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Your question is

2550
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
First in the second step

2551
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Try to answer

2552
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Laser cooling to bc

2553
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
You have to find a way to make your atoms

2554
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
A transparent mechanism

2555
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
In this experiment

2556
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Is through a

2557
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
In our transparency

2558
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
To let the atom

2559
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
For this light

2560
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Be transparent

2561
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
But in space

2562
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
We have to find a way

2563
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
To put the atom

2564
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
From the oven stage

2565
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Cool to have a way

2566
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Uh, there are two

2567
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
The steps of laser cooling

2568
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Assuming

2569
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
If you use other 2A elements

2570
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Cover the atom

2571
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
His

2572
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Transition

2573
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Its bandwidth is 350Hz

2574
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
That he actually

2575
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Doing this

2576
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Atom

2577
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
If you use the atom

2578
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Your

2579
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Transfer

2580
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Difficult to achieve

2581
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
That is to say

2582
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
If you want to do this

2583
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Transfer

2584
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Difficult

2585
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
7.4kHz

2586
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
It corresponds to

2587
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
15

2588
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
15

2589
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
If you use the atom

2590
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
350kHz

2591
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
350Hz

2592
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Almost

2593
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Not too scattered

2594
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
That means you're hard

2595
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Efficient deceleration

2596
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
You almost can't

2597
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
For

2598
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
You cover the atom again

2599
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It's hard to decelerate

2600
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
That is to say

2601
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Somehow

2602
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
In a sweet spot

2603
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Hello

2604
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Hello

2605
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Hello

2606
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Hey

2607
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Other questions

2608
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Hello

2609
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Hello

2610
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Other people

2611
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
If you don't have any questions, you can ask now

2612
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Otherwise, our speech will end today

2613
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Hello

2614
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Hello

2615
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Hello

2616
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Please turn on the mic

2617
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Let's give a round of applause to Junjia

2618
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Okay, only me left

2619
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Sorry

2620
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Because I asked some small details

2621
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I'm afraid everyone is getting impatient

2622
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Thank you

2623
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Junjia, next time we'll discuss other questions with you

2624
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Okay

2625
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Okay, thank you

2626
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Junjia, go to sleep

2627
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It's a bit late, it's 3pm

2628
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Okay

2629
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Good night

2630
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Bye

2631
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Thank you for watching!

2632
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
See you next time!
