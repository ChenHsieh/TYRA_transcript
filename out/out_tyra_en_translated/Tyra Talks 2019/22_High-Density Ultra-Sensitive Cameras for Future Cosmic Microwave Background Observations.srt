00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the last Tera Talk this year.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are honored to have Dr. He Shuai-Pu at Princeton University.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He is going to talk about Large Millimeter Volumetric Array for CMB Observation.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let me introduce Dr. He first.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He got his Ph.D. in Physics at Princeton in 2017.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He is now working as a postdoc at Princeton.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
His main focus is Experimental Cosmology.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
His main work is Detector and Readout Development.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He has participated in several flagship CMB experiments.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Such as ABS-Atacama BMO Search, ACT-POL, Advanced ACT, Simons Observatory, and CMBS-POL.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Before I start, I'd like to say that

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,000
our goal is to share our progress with Taiwanese students around the world.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We hope to increase the opportunities for cooperation and exchange.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you are interested in participating in our project,

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
we hope you can sign up for our talk next year.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can sign up for our talk on our Facebook page.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. He.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello, everyone.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to talk about Large Millimeter Volumetric Array for CMB Observation.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The topics I'm going to cover are mainly two experiments.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You can see ACT-POL on the right side of the page.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There are some collaborations.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They are mainly founded by NSF and Chile Conocet.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The other one is Simons Observatory.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can see that the collaboration has become larger.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's mainly founded by Simons Foundation.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, let's move on.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There is a beautiful starry sky with our telescope.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You may be familiar with this picture.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
On the left is the starting point, Big Ben.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course, there is an argument.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There is no Big Ben.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
As time goes by, it becomes where we are now.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I mainly study cosmic background radiation, CMB.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It is the first light we can see.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It originated about 400,000 years ago.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or 380,000 years ago.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What can we learn from this study?

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
When we look at CMB,

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the first thing we look at is its intensity.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is Planck's intensity map.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There are hot spots and cold spots.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It is a full sky observation.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In addition to intensity,

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
there is a weak signal, polarization.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It is mainly from electrons and photons.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There is Thomson scattering,

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
which causes linear polarization.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When we observe this polarization directly,

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you will see a cross mark on the left.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There is a 45-degree cross mark on the right.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is called Q and U.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is the map we can observe most directly.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This means that we have observed polarization.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We usually convert it into E mode and B mode.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can see that E mode has symmetry and B mode does not.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is the map we can observe most directly.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We usually convert it into E mode and B mode.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can see that the temperature of the power spectrum is 10³µKv².

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It is actually a very weak signal.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But the signal of polarization is smaller,

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
about one tenth or less.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So we can measure the temperature very precisely.

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But when you want to measure polarization,

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you need a more sensitive instrument to detect it more accurately.

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is a theory model.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And this is the data obtained from recent experiments.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is a map of the universe.

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If we look at the CMB directly,

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
we can know how old the universe is.

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Although we know that the universe is more than 400,000 years old,

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we want to know more precisely.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The shape of the universe and its structural formation.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But we also have more secondary anisotropy to understand.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because light passes through so many things in the middle and reaches our eyes.

76
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We can know some secondary effects from it.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
For example, gravitational lensing or SZ effect.

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can also know that there are some stars or galaxies in the middle of the universe.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So why is it difficult to measure CMB?

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
As I said earlier,

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
just look at the temperature and anisotropy,

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the temperature signal is about 10 to the 3 microKelvin squared.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You can see that there is a Cyan line here.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But in between CMB and our eyes,

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
there are many other things in the middle.

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The main components of CMB are dust and synchrotron.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The red band and the green line.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When you see the polarization signal is weaker,

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you can see that the impact of dust and synchrotron is deeper.

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This means that we need a way to decompose the different components.

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:58,000
To understand the character of dust and synchrotron at different frequencies.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Then you can remove it to get pure CMB.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Therefore, when we develop instruments,

94
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
we need to have different frequency bands.

95
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The more cover, the more frequency band.

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The more cover, the more sky.

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In this way, we can remove these extra signals to get pure CMB.

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
From the beginning,

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
of course, there are so many dust and synchrotron in the outer space.

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You don't want to interfere with your observations from other sources.

101
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, the cleanest way is to transfer everything to outer space.

102
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There is COBE satellite, WMAP, and Planck.

103
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You can see that the sensitivity is getting higher and higher.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But sending everything to outer space is a very expensive thing.

105
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Another way is to build a telescope on the earth.

106
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But that requires a longer period of time.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And your instrument needs to be more sensitive.

108
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So, there are two main places where we build telescopes to observe CMB.

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
One is Atacama Desert, Chile.

110
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The other is Antarctica.

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In Atacama Desert and Chile,

112
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
there are ACT, Polar Bear, and Klaus.

113
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They are mainly focused on CMB observation.

114
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In Antarctica, there are mainly SPT, BICEP, and Keck Array.

115
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So, in the five ground-based experiments we just talked about,

116
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the technology we use is called Transition Edge Sensor, or TES.

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
TES is a barometer.

118
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
When the photon comes in,

119
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the barometer has a weak thermal path to the T bath.

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When the photon comes in,

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the temperature of TES will rise.

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
TES is a very sharp transition.

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
When the temperature of TES rises,

124
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the resistance of TES also rises.

125
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The dual power of TES will decrease.

126
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
TES is in a stable state.

127
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
How do you read the signal of TES?

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We use a coupler to an inductor.

129
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

130
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

131
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

132
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

133
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is a simple way to read the signal.

134
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What does TES look like?

135
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is a typical TES design.

136
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You can see that TES is in the middle.

137
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The temperature of TES depends on its material.

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The temperature of TES depends on its material.

139
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We have just mentioned the two cases.

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We have just mentioned the two cases.

141
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We want to maintain a certain temperature,

142
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
we want to maintain a certain temperature,.

143
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,880
The primary weak point of TES material is its thinness of silicon nitride leg.

144
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,880
This is why we call it TES Island,

145
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,880
because it is made up of four supporting legs,

146
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,880
and the fabrication is very delicate.

147
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,880
C stands for Thermal Conductance or Thermal Conductivity,

148
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,880
and Platinum Gold.

149
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,880
C stands for Heat Capacity.

150
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:49,880
We control the amount of Platinum Gold in the TES Island

151
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,880
to determine its heat capacity.

152
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:01,880
The width of the TES is 280 microns,

153
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,880
and the length is twice that,

154
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,880
560 or 600 microns.

155
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,880
It is a very tiny component.

156
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,880
We use TES to measure the CMB signal.

157
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:29,880
The main CMB observations are measured by TES.

158
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Since 2009,

159
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,880
we have been building these experiments.

160
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,880
As time goes by,

161
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:49,880
there are more and more detectors on the telescope.

162
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:57,880
This is because our TES technology has reached a limit.

163
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,880
This means that the current TES is already in good condition.

164
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,880
How do you enhance the sensitivity of the telescope?

165
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
The more detectors on the telescope, the better.

166
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:25,880
We have used up to 3,000 or 3,000,000 detectors.

167
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:43,880
This is a map of Atacama Desert, Chile.

168
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,880
It is a very desolate area.

169
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:57,880
The sky is very clean,

170
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:05,880
and there is little dust.

171
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:15,880
We live in a 2,500-meter-high desert.

172
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,880
The act, polar bear, and Klaus are on top of the mountain.

173
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,880
The act is on the left,

174
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,880
the polar bear is on the top, and Klaus is on the bottom.

175
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,880
This mountain is about 5,200 meters high.

176
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,880
This is our act telescope.

177
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,880
The main component of this telescope is that we have a ground screen outside,

178
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,880
which is about 12 meters high.

179
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,880
We want to reduce silo or pick up from the ground.

180
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,880
We built a ground screen outside our telescope.

181
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,880
We have a primary mirror and a secondary mirror.

182
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,880
The primary mirror is about 6 meters in diameter.

183
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,880
The secondary mirror is about 2 meters in diameter.

184
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,880
The resolution of the entire telescope is 1.4 seconds.

185
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:27,880
The receiver is at the tip of the arrow.

186
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,880
The field of view is 1 degree.

187
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,880
We use a dilution refrigerator,

188
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,880
which allows continuous operation of 100 millikelvin,

189
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:49,880
which is very important for sensitive detector functionality.

190
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:57,880
This is one of the tubes.

191
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,880
There are three tubes in the receiver.

192
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,880
From 300K, which is room temperature,

193
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,880
all the way down to 100 millikelvin.

194
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,880
My main job is to focus on the array module of 100 millikelvin.

195
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,880
The picture shown above is the act camera of different generations.

196
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:27,880
What did we put in the act?

197
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,880
In 2013, the camera in the act was called M-Vac.

198
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I was involved in the act since 2013.

199
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I was involved in the act since 2013.

200
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,880
I was involved in the act since 2013.

201
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,880
The central frequency of the detector is 150 GHz,

202
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,880
or 90 to 150 GHz.

203
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
These are all polarimeters,

204
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,880
which can observe two polarizations at the same time.

205
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,880
These are all polarimeters,

206
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,880
which can observe two polarizations at the same time.

207
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,880
M-Vac can only observe intensity.

208
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Since the beginning of PA3,

209
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,880
we can observe two polarizations at the same time.

210
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,880
We can observe two polarizations at the same time.

211
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:59,880
We can observe two polarizations at the same time.

212
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,880
We can use the same pixel to double the detector count.

213
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,880
We can use the same pixel to double the detector count.

214
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Since 2016, we have upgraded to Advanced Act.

215
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Since 2016, we have upgraded to Advanced Act.

216
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,600
Interactions

217
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Interactions

218
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Synchronous Congistion

219
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Synchronous Congistion

220
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Synchronous Congistion

221
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Synchronous Congistion

222
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Yama is the logo of AQPoL

223
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Miss Katya is the logo of AQPoL

224
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Miss Katya is a cute mouse

225
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
I have a question

226
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I think your logo is super cute

227
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
My question is

228
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,600
If you have different bands

229
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
You can observe them

230
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
You can keep averaging

231
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
And the noise will get lower and lower

232
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
If you have multi-band

233
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Can you keep reducing the noise

234
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
And increase the sensitivity?

235
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Or will it be limited by dust?

236
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Or will it be limited by dust?

237
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:40,600
I think it's limited by technology

238
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
That's what CMBS4 wants to do

239
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,600
We want to put more than

240
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
What I'm showing now

241
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
More than two-digit

242
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
More than two-digit

243
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Detector count

244
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,600
They want to observe for five to ten years

245
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
They want to observe for five to ten years

246
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
The length to be observed

247
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Has something to do with your funding source

248
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Has something to do with your funding source

249
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
We haven't reached that limit yet

250
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
We haven't reached that limit yet

251
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
So at least

252
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
From this chart

253
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Let's start from mid-2016

254
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Because the Advanced AQPoL

255
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
At least it's not cut off

256
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
It's extended to the outside

257
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
So at least in the years after 2020

258
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
As long as you continue to observe

259
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
The sensitivity can keep going down

260
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Upward

261
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
That's what it means

262
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Thank you

263
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
But in 2021

264
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
It's supposed to be decommissioned

265
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Now

266
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Let's move on to

267
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Let's move on to

268
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
The left side of the chart

269
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
The left side of the chart

270
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

271
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
There's a little square

272
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
That's our so-called pixel

273
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
That's our so-called pixel

274
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
What's the component in this pixel?

275
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
You can see the TS I just showed

276
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
You can see the TS I just showed

277
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
The left side is called yts and xts

278
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
The left side is called yts and xts

279
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
They are measured in different polarizations

280
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
They are measured in different polarizations

281
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
How does it know

282
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
What is the accepted polarization

283
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
We use the one in the middle called

284
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Orthomode transducer

285
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Like a arrow

286
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Like a arrow

287
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Light hits

288
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Light hits

289
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
And they go up and down

290
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
And they go up and down

291
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
And one go to the left and right direction

292
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
And they go to the left and right direction

293
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Then there are some on-trip filters

294
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Then there are some on-trip filters

295
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
And  sink to TS

296
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
And sink to TS

297
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
The bottoms are the channel on-trip filter

298
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
The bottoms are the channel on-trip filter

299
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
You can separate by 2 pixel

300
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
You can separate by 2 pixel

301
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Let 2 ff

302
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Let 2 ff

303
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
The number left 4tx

304
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
The number left 2tx

305
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
The number left 4tx

306
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
The number left 4tx

307
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
The number left 150 Ghz

308
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
The number left 90 GHz

309
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
The number left 90 Ghz

310
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
The number left 90 Ghz

311
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
The number left Google Sachan

312
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,600
The numbers on the right

313
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
The numbers on the left

314
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Size is different

315
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I have a question

316
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Usually your bandwidth is how many?

317
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
I think it's

318
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
False 20

319
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Yes, so it's the bandwidth

320
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,600
We will design the bandwidth

321
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Don't go to 0.2 line or 0.2 line

322
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
That's what we want to avoid

323
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
We can control our bandwidth

324
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,600
2.30 is on a 0.2 line

325
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Yes, but we didn't avoid it

326
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Our design is 2.20

327
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
So the bandwidth is super narrow

328
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,600
20 is 1.50 or 1.90

329
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
They might have more error

330
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
So on-chip filter

331
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I will talk about it later

332
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
On-chip filter is important

333
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Because it controls the most precise bandwidth

334
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Like our VHORN

335
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
And some optics

336
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
To control other bands

337
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,600
So after the optical design

338
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
We will make sure it doesn't cross

339
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
The side region we don't want

340
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Here you can see

341
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
The right one

342
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
The OMT size is only 1.3

343
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
And the left one

344
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
The OMT size is 2mm

345
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
So you might think

346
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
What does it matter

347
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Well

348
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
OMT is a film

349
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
A film

350
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
The circle part

351
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Is transparent

352
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
It's a very thin film

353
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
And this film

354
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Is like a metal

355
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
On the film

356
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
So you need to control

357
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
The film

358
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
On 1.3mm

359
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
You can imagine

360
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
How hard it is

361
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
To grow the film

362
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
On a 6-inch wafer

363
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Or 4-inch wafer

364
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
It's not easy

365
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
The left one

366
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Is the first generation

367
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Pixel

368
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
And the second generation

369
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
On the wafer

370
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Our wafer

371
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Is 3-inch

372
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
75mm

373
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Now we move the technique

374
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
To 6-inch

375
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Wafer

376
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
We want to

377
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Closely packed

378
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Pixels on the wafer

379
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
So you can see

380
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Instead of a square packed

381
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Square design

382
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
We have a

383
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Rhombus

384
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Rhombus

385
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Pixel design

386
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
So we can put more

387
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Detectors on it

388
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
And

389
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
The left one

390
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
3-inch

391
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Wafer

392
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
We can only put

393
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
244 channels

394
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
But the 150mm

395
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
6-inch wafer

396
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
We can read out

397
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
More than 2000 channels

398
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
One channel is one TES

399
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
So you can see

400
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Double the size

401
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
We want to

402
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Push the sensitivity

403
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
So we have to

404
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Put more detectors

405
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
On the fixed focal plane

406
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
This is what I just said

407
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Detectors

408
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
In addition to on-chip filter

409
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
The OMT

410
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
OMT is

411
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Under the right image

412
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
OMT couple detector

413
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
It couple to

414
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Feehorn

415
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Feehorn

416
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
It's a cone-shaped

417
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
It can control

418
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Your light path

419
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
From the top

420
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
To the OMT

421
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
You don't want

422
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
The light go through the OMT

423
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
You want to

424
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Make best use of

425
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
The light source

426
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
So you have to put a

427
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Facture

428
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Like a cover

429
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
To make sure

430
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
The light will not

431
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Go through the OMT

432
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
And make extra noise

433
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
To your signal

434
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
All of these

435
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Are made out of

436
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Silicon

437
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
The horn array

438
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
We take

439
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
500 microns

440
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Wafers

441
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
And we use

442
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Three

443
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Three edges

444
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
To make a circle

445
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
And

446
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Each layer

447
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Has a circle size

448
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
We call it silicon horn array

449
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
The main reason

450
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
To use silicon

451
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Is to make a thermal match

452
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
With the detector wafer

453
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
We want to make sure

454
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
There won't be any thermal

455
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Contraction issue

456
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
And make the detector break

457
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
So

458
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
This picture is

459
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
To show

460
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
How to read out

461
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
With detector array

462
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
And

463
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
It's not

464
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
About reading out

465
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
But

466
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
About

467
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
How cumbersome

468
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
The assembly is

469
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
So we have a detector wafer

470
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
And we put it

471
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
On a base

472
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
And we need to

473
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Do a lot of

474
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Wire bond

475
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
To make a connection

476
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
To

477
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Silicon component

478
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
So we can connect it

479
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
To

480
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
100mC stage

481
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
So we need to

482
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Push it layer by layer

483
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
To 1k, 4k, 40k

484
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
And

485
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Eventually to room temperature

486
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
So

487
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
It usually

488
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Takes about

489
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
A year

490
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
To make an array

491
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
On the left

492
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Is the array

493
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
And on the right

494
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Is the advanced array

495
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
And

496
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
For Ack

497
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
The average time

498
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
To make an array

499
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Is about a year

500
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Usually

501
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
You will

502
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Start the next

503
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Array assembly

504
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
And

505
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
At the same time

506
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
You can put it

507
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
On the base

508
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
So

509
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
In summary

510
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
We have

511
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
PA1 and PA2

512
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
We have

513
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
1000 TS detector

514
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
PA3 has 1000 TS detector

515
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
But

516
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
PA1 and

517
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
PA2 have 1000 TS detector

518
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
PA3 has 1000 TS detector

519
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
And

520
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
For EO

521
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
The more you know

522
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
The more time you spend

523
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
And the more you learn

524
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
So it's bad at first

525
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
But it gets better

526
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
50%, 70%, 80%

527
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
And

528
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
For

529
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Advanced Ack

530
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
PA4

531
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
HF array

532
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
HF array is

533
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
220GHz and

534
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
150GHz

535
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
And

536
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
HF array

537
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Has 2000 TS

538
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
And

539
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
MF array

540
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Has 90GHz and

541
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
150GHz

542
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
And

543
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
MF array

544
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Has 1700 TS

545
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
And

546
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
It's

547
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Improved

548
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
For EO

549
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
The same result

550
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
For PA4

551
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
70%

552
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
For PA6

553
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
90%

554
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
And

555
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
For EO

556
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
For TS

557
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Sensitivity

558
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
If the array

559
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Is only 50%

560
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
You have to

561
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Observe

562
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,600
The device

563
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Or

564
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Put the same array

565
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
To get the same sensitivity

566
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
So we want to

567
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Achieve 100% EO

568
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
But for CMB

569
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Camera

570
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
This is

571
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
The best

572
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
I haven't heard of

573
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
95%

574
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I have a question

575
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
What is

576
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
The main problem

577
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
For EO

578
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Wirebond?

579
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Mainly for wirebond

580
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
And

581
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Readout

582
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Readout component

583
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
It's hard to fabricate

584
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
It needs

585
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Many steps

586
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
So usually

587
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
For EO

588
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
And

589
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
For readout

590
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
It's a problem

591
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
You can see

592
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Interconnect

593
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Flexible cables

594
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
And

595
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Usually

596
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Wirebond

597
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
To

598
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Detector

599
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Or readout

600
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
The failure

601
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Contribute

602
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Thank you

603
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
So

604
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Your squid

605
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Is made by NIST?

606
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Our squid is made by NIST

607
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
I see, thank you

608
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
I haven't mentioned

609
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Readout

610
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
It's another in our talk

611
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
But our app

612
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Mainly uses TDM

613
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Time domain multiplexing

614
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
I haven't mentioned multiplexing

615
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
But

616
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
With so many detectors

617
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
It's impossible to readout

618
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
So we need to do multiplexing

619
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You need to group

620
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Some detectors

621
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
And readout

622
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
To

623
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Speed up

624
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Data speed

625
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
The last

626
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
LF array

627
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
Will be released in January

628
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
This array

629
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Is challenging

630
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
You can see

631
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
The same wave

632
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
But not many pixels

633
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
And each

634
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
OMT

635
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Let me see

636
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
Every OMT

637
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Is much bigger

638
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Compared with

639
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
MF and HF

640
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
About 1 cm

641
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
As i said

642
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
The transparent part

643
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Is membrane

644
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
This membrane

645
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Distress

646
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
And metal

647
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
It's a

648
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Difficult technology

649
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
So

650
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
It's challenging

651
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
In R&D

652
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
But we made it

653
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
And

654
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Initial testing result

655
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Is reasonable

656
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
We will release it in January

657
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Hopefully

658
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I see some light

659
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
The next one

660
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Is Simon's Observatory

661
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
I was talking about

662
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Act

663
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Our new plan

664
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Is to build

665
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
A new observatory

666
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Next to Act

667
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
This observatory

668
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Is mainly

669
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Composed by

670
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
On the right

671
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
We call it

672
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Large Aperture Telescope

673
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
L-A-T

674
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
It's a 6m cross-dragon

675
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Telescope

676
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
L-A-T

677
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Let us see

678
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Small-scale signal

679
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Act is sensitive

680
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
To the power spectrum

681
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
L is greater than 200

682
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
To

683
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Above

684
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
The power spectrum

685
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
So

686
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Usually

687
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
You want to build it bigger and bigger

688
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
So

689
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
So

690
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
And

691
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
It's limited by technology

692
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
So

693
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
This telescope

694
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Is designed

695
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,600
13 optics tubes

696
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
But

697
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
We will only put

698
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
7 tubes

699
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
And each tube

700
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Will have 3

701
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
6-inch detector

702
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Array

703
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
So

704
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
The receiver

705
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Will have 21 detector array

706
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Compare to Act

707
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Act has 3, L has 21

708
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
This

709
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Observatory

710
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Is a giant

711
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
2.8m

712
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
In length

713
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
The whole

714
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Platform

715
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Has

716
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
About 15m

717
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Height

718
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Another small aperture telescope

719
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
We call it S-A-T

720
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Sensitive to L below 200

721
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Like

722
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Bicep

723
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Polar bear array

724
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Mainly

725
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Focusing on

726
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Primordial BMO

727
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
The mirror is

728
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
0.5m

729
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
And

730
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Baseline is

731
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
3 S-A-T

732
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Each S-A-T

733
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Can have 7 array

734
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
So

735
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
About 21

736
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Detector

737
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
With funding

738
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
4 S-A-T

739
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
28 detector

740
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
So

741
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
The total

742
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Detector count

743
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
We have

744
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
2 technologies

745
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
And we will

746
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Deploy

747
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
The first

748
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
NIST

749
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
NIST

750
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
MF

751
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
UHF

752
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
And

753
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
220 and 270 GHz

754
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
So

755
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
NIST will focus on

756
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
These two

757
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Detector type

758
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Another

759
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Berkeley

760
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
They will

761
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Do another array

762
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Their

763
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Central frequency sensitive to

764
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
30 to 40 GHz

765
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
This is another technology

766
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
The same

767
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
TS technology

768
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
In total

769
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
It will have

770
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
60,000 TS

771
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Barometer

772
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
When we deploy

773
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
60,000 TS

774
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Barometer

775
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
So

776
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Magnitude

777
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
More than

778
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
At

779
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
So

780
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,600
This is

781
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Summary

782
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Assignment of

783
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Plan

784
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Supposedly

785
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
We want to deploy S-A-T

786
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Next year

787
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Sometime

788
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Then

789
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Then

790
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Deploy

791
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
The rest

792
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
S-A-T

793
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
And

794
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Populate

795
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
S-A-T optics

796
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
So

797
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,600
This is

798
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
My role in assignment

799
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Mainly

800
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Scheduling

801
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Besides

802
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
The detector and readout

803
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
Plan

804
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
So

805
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Today's talk

806
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Ends here

807
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Thank you

808
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Yama

809
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
Any questions?

810
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Let's

811
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Turn on the mic

812
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,600
So the speaker can hear

813
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Applause

814
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Thank you

815
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
For the wonderful talk

816
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Then

817
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Before Q&A

818
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
I want to say

819
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
This is so cute

820
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,600
There is no such cute logo in the lab

821
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
And this

822
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
OK

823
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Any questions?

824
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I have a question

825
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
That

826
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
The new array

827
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
It is

828
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,600
Work independently

829
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
Interferometry

830
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
It is

831
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Uh

832
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
In

833
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Uh

834
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Uh

835
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Our array does not work independently

836
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
They are

837
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Scanned at the same time

838
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Yes

839
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Will you do

840
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Interferometry

841
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
There are three telescopes

842
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Coordinate observation

843
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
But

844
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
They can cross-check

845
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
We will cross-check

846
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
You

847
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
If they see the same sky

848
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
Then

849
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
We will cross-check

850
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Make sure

851
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
No systematics

852
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,600
We build

853
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
So many small

854
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
At the same time

855
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Not a bigger

856
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Or something

857
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
You can

858
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Remove the systematics

859
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Which is really big

860
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Telescope

861
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
So

862
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
There is no way to make it

863
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Like a

864
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Baseline

865
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Baseline

866
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
There should be two baselines

867
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
At least you can

868
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
I don't know if resolution is important to you

869
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
I think you can use some techniques

870
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
But I think

871
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Idea should be different from interferometry

872
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
OK

873
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Every time

874
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,600
What time scale

875
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
Time

876
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Uh

877
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Every integration

878
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,600
How long

879
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,600
Very fast

880
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
I forgot

881
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Anyway, it's fast

882
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
There may be no way to do this

883
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
You

884
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
You usually don't see time

885
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Interference

886
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
There may be some interference

887
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
OK

888
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Then

889
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,600
This picture

890
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
The reason why it's so far

891
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
And every thing has a show

892
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Don't want to be affected by others

893
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Because

894
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
If you hit this

895
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
Then hit another panel

896
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Um

897
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
Then I ask another question

898
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
OK

899
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
Is

900
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,600
In the end

901
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
These things need

902
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Because generally speaking

903
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
In traditional astronomical observation

904
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
You want better reflectivity

905
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,600
Make the mirror bigger

906
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Then make the detector bigger

907
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
There is a bigger field of view

908
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
But I see you

909
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Still a few meters

910
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
That is

911
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,600
What is the reason

912
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,600
Because now

913
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,600
It's easy to do

914
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
12 meters or even 20 meters

915
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
There should be no problem

916
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
That

917
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
Detector size can't follow

918
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
What is the reason

919
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600
Go up

920
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
Bigger

921
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,600
We are

922
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
I want to be smaller

923
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
But the area

924
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,600
No, the area should be bigger

925
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Should not say detector

926
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
The field of view is mainly

927
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,600
The size of the focal plane

928
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,600
The focal plane is the population

929
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,600
You have a focal plane

930
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,600
How many detectors are there

931
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
Yes

932
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
You should be talking about

933
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
The bigger the focal plane

934
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
How many inside

935
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
The bigger you do

936
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,600
The more detectors inside

937
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Increase the field of view

938
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
But

939
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,600
We are mainly limited by

940
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,600
We just want to do this

941
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
2.8 meters long

942
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
Receiver

943
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
It's already big

944
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
Every stage is already big

945
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Because we have to cool down

946
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
To 100 millikelvin

947
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,600
Cryogenic technology is very strong

948
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,600
Then you

949
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
We need a lot of pulse tube

950
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
And dilution fridge

951
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
Our pump

952
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
May need more

953
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,600
And just imagine

954
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,600
You this

955
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,600
300k

956
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Window

957
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
At first we thought

958
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Can we find such a big window

959
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
Or every individual

960
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,600
Optics tube

961
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
Have your own shape

962
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,600
That material

963
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
It's hard to control

964
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,600
Hard to go

965
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
And every stage

966
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
We have filters

967
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,600
Define the low pass band

968
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
That filter

969
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Size is also a problem

970
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
I don't think

971
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
We are not

972
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
Current ground base

973
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,600
The biggest mirror is SPT

974
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,600
They did 10 meters

975
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
Yes

976
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,600
But consider

977
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,600
All kinds of technology

978
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
And efficiency

979
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
The final decision is

980
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Choose 6 meters

981
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Then

982
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
Any questions?

983
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,600
I have two questions

984
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,600
The first question is

985
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
Your wafer

986
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,600
Back short

987
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,600
You said it's silicon

988
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
Is it pure silicon?

989
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Or you have etched

990
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
My question is

991
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,600
Back short

992
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,600
The top

993
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,600
It's a flat surface

994
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,600
It's a

995
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Pure silicon

996
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
There is a

997
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,600
Back short cavity

998
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,600
You can see

999
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,600
It's magnified

1000
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,600
It has a groove

1001
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,600
It has

1002
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,600
It has

1003
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,600
Feature

1004
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,600
It covers

1005
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,600
TS

1006
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
It won't see

1007
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
Light leak

1008
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,600
From other TS

1009
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,600
It covers TS

1010
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,600
It has

1011
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
Some design

1012
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Determine

1013
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
We can

1014
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,600
Obtain all light

1015
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,600
But won't let TS

1016
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,600
Contaminated

1017
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,600
No cross talk

1018
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,600
I see

1019
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,600
It's like

1020
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
Blocking

1021
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,600
We'll

1022
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,600
Back it

1023
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
We'll use

1024
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,600
Sidecast

1025
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
Ok

1026
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,600
I see

1027
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
So

1028
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
It's purpose

1029
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,600
You're a barometer

1030
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
You want

1031
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,600
Reflection

1032
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,600
Collect energy

1033
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,600
Is it?

1034
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,600
Yes

1035
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,600
I see

1036
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Ok

1037
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
I have another question

1038
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
I think

1039
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,600
We should wait

1040
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,600
So

1041
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,600
Any other questions?

1042
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,600
I have a question

1043
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,600
Please

1044
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,600
You

1045
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,600
Observe data for CMB

1046
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,600
And

1047
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Other groups

1048
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
Do other science?

1049
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Yes

1050
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
A big part

1051
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Analysis people

1052
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
They do

1053
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
Secondary

1054
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
They often

1055
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,600
With DS

1056
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Or

1057
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
LST

1058
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Combine

1059
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Act

1060
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Some people

1061
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
With Subaru

1062
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Many

1063
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,600
Collaboration

1064
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Many useful data

1065
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Can be applied

1066
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600
Not only

1067
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,600
Pure CMB

1068
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,600
Act is doing well

1069
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
All data

1070
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
Released publicly

1071
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
Everyone can

1072
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,600
Reproduce

1073
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
And

1074
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,600
We welcome

1075
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
And SO

1076
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,600
To that direction

1077
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
But no data

1078
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Do you want to collaborate?

1079
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
This skill is different from mine

1080
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,600
In a few years

1081
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Ok

1082
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,600
Any other questions?

1083
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,600
Time is up

1084
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Let's applaud

1085
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,600
Thank you

1086
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,600
For your wonderful speech

1087
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
That's all

1088
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,600
Thank you
