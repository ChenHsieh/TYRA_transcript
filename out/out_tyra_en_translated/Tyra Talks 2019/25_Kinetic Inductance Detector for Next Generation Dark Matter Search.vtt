00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's Project Terra talk.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I'm the host today. Just call me Ted.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Today's speaker is Don Yen-Yong from Caltech.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
He works at NASA JPL in Caltech.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
Today's topic is Connected Inductance Detector for Next-Generation Dark Matter Search.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
So, Yen-Yong, it's your turn.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Hi, everyone.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Today's talk is more like an update on the latest situation.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I think I've talked about what I've done a year ago.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Actually, the content is pretty much the same, but there's a new progress.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Some parts of the talk might be fast, and some parts might not be clear.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
To be honest, I've been very busy lately, so I've only started this morning.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
So if you don't ask questions, it'll be over soon.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Today's topic is connected...

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Let me add that when you come in, you don't have a microphone on.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
So if you want to ask a question, you have to turn on the microphone.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So you can ask the question and hear it.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
At the same time, you can also ask the question in the chat next to you.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Okay, sorry. Yen-Yong, let's get started.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Okay, I have another question.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Can you see my mouse?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Can you see it?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
You can see it, right?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Because I might talk about this and that a lot, so I need a mouse.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay, so today's topic is Kinetic Inductance Detector for Next Generation Dark Matter Search.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
So as you can see, there are two parts to the topic.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
One part is that we're thinking about looking for dark matter.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
At this stage, we're going to look at future development.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
The other part of this talk is that we think we can apply this.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
We call it KIT, K-I-T, Kinetic Inductance Detector.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
As the next main, we think it's going to be very competitive.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
This technology to do this.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay, and then this work is mainly from where I am.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Caltech and NASA JPL, which is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Of course, this whole work is actually based on a bigger project called Super CDMS.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I'll talk about it later.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
But I want to emphasize that KIT is not a CDMS project yet.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
So it's more like our own R&D.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
But we're doing it in a big collaboration.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Okay, so now you see this first page.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
The first page is our current prototype.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
That gives you a sense of the size.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
This circle is 3 inches.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Its diameter is 3 inches.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
It's about the same size as a palm.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
So now you see this little rectangle.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
It's about a half to one millimeter in size.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And then there are 80 little islands on it.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I'll explain what it is.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay, and then this box.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
It's basically hanging on a dilution refrigerator.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
So it can be lowered to the temperature of the mini Kelvin level.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So I'll explain why we're doing this.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Okay, first of all, today's outline is why.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Because we don't have a particle physics background today.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
And there seems to be a problem, right?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
So I'm going to explain a little bit today.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Why do we think there's dark matter?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
What the hell is dark matter?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So I'm going to use an association here.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
What's more important is that this is our focus.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Why do we think this low-quality, low-mass dark matter is an important topic now?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
So we want to do this.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Okay, this is an opening.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
And then I'll talk about the super CDMS detector called HVEV.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
HVE is high voltage.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
EV is the electron volt.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
He's actually talking about what we're doing in a high voltage mode.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Under this operation, we can have EV resolution.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay, so I'm going to start by saying that this is a CDMS project.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
What did we learn from this?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
So what did we get?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So where's our sensitivity?

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
So from here, I'm going to motivate.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
So why the third part, the kinetic inductance detector, this thing.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
It's going to be something that we think is very potential.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
So now the CDMS proposal is written to 2025.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
So we're actually talking about this thing.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Dark matter search beyond 2025.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
What kind of outlook do we have?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
What do we think?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Okay, let's get started.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Then I welcome you to ask me any questions at any time.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Otherwise, this talk is really going to be pretty fast.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
And my speech is actually very fast.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Okay, the first part, low-mass dark matter.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay, first of all, I remember two or three weeks ago.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I have a very good friend, He Shuyu.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
He talked about a talk.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
He's actually doing the theory of dark matter.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So why is there dark matter?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
What the hell is dark matter?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I just have this page today.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
So if you're interested, you want to know more details.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You can go see his talk.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
He's a very good speaker.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
He taught very well.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Then I'll summarize here.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
This is some evidence that we think there is dark matter.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
First of all, you see this picture in the upper left corner.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
The y-axis of this picture is the speed of the planet's rotation in the Milky Way.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
What about this horizontal axis?

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
It's the distance between these planets and the center of the Milky Way.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Okay, so now you see that there are dozens of lines here.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
And then more than 20 lines.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
If we take a few steps.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
These lines, each line is a galaxy.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Then you can go to the galaxy.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
There are a lot of planets in the galaxy.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
The speed of rotation to the center.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And then the distance to the center.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
You see a line like this.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
It's a galaxy, a galaxy, a galaxy.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
According to Newton's law that we learned in high school.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
If today we assume that Newton's law is correct.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Or relative theory is correct.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Then we think he's right.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
OK, what about this line?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
What should it look like?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It should look like this.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's from the top.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
The closer to the center, the faster the rotation.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And then it goes down like this.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And then the closer it is to the outside, the slower it rotates.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
OK.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
But in fact, what we see is not like this.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
In fact, what we see is.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
The speed of rotation of these planets.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
It's going to pull up from the center.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Of course, it's very close to the center.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
We don't understand.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Because there are a lot of planets in the middle.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
A lot of electrons and so on.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Then we get rid of the middle.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
He saw that it was almost flat.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
OK, almost flat.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
That means.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Of course, we can say.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Then this may be.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
The theory of gravity is incorrect.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
This is possible.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
But gravity has been experimented by a lot of experiments.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
From classical gravity to the theory of gravity.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
The theory of gravity has been very, very accurately verified.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
So then we can think about it in another way.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Is that?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Hey, we have quality.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
It exists in that range.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
But we didn't see it.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
We can't see these qualities.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
So we miscalculated.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
But if we add these qualities.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We can recover like this.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
This is the center of gravity.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
The speed of rotation of this curve.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
OK, this is a hint.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
That is to say, there may be some matter over there.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
We can't see it.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
We call it dark matter.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
But OK.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
So you can imagine this dark matter.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Under this picture.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Like a fluid or a gas.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
It's a continuous.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And then it's distributed smoothly in that space.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
In the middle of the galaxy.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
OK.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
But we don't know its particle nature.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
That is to say, we can understand.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
For example, air or water.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
But we can't find that molecule.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
That H2O.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
OK.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Now in this upper right corner.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
What you see is a bigger scale.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
This simulation.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
You are in this simulation.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Every little light spot you see.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It's all a bunch of galaxies.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
It's no longer one by one.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
It's a bunch of galaxies.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
OK.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Then this picture is actually white.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
So you can see the black part.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
What about this black part?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
That is, if we assume.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
There is a gas in this universe.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
It's not going to be with other gases.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
This is the interaction.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But it has weight.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
So it's going to have a denser place.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Because gravity attracts.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
And then it's going to form.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Like this spider web structure.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And then these spider web structures are denser.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Gravity is heavier.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
It will attract these gases.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
These we can see.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
These normal.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
These substances.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Gather together.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And then form a galaxy.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Then we found out.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
We must be in our computer.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
In this simulation.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
With this kind of content.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
We can.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Simulate this.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
The evolution of the universe.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And then we produce what we want.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
The density of this galaxy.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So we think this is also a proof.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
That is, there is a kind of matter that will not interact.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Dark matter.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
This is Bully Cluster.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I won't talk about this.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Everyone can go.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
This can be googled.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
This is a bit complicated.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
But basically, he said.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
If there are two galaxies colliding today.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
We can see the quality inside.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Will hit and will not pass.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
The difference in quality.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Then we found out that he had to have a part.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Will not touch.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Passed by.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
OK, what about the last one?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
This is a very, very accurate evidence.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
This is what we see.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
The change in temperature in the whole sky.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I call the background color of the universe.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
The change in temperature in the whole sky.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And then he changed this.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And then we found out.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
If we assume that this change is from.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
When the universe was very, very early.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
These substances.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
This process of gathering together.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
The moment of that temperature.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
OK.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
That.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
These condensed substances.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It must have a certain proportion.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Will interact.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
A certain proportion will not collide with each other.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
That proportion can be very, very accurate.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Fixed.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
This is the case.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
OK, so we know from here.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, that.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
We can calculate very accurately.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
In this universe.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
20 to 30% will not interact.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Of this substance.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Then about 5% will interact.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
What about the rest?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
This is another energy content.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Dark energy.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
But we won't talk about it today.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
So these are the evidence of dark matter.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
That's a bit like a science.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Do you have any questions?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
If you are interested in any of these.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I can talk a little bit.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Otherwise, we'll go.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
What does this angle scale mean?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Why is the angle scale?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Oh, OK.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So this picture is like this.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
You can of course.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
This thing.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
It's the color next to it.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
The whole universe.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Just put your temperature on it.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Different temperatures have different colors.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
But you can do this today.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
A map of the 2D map.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But it's a universe.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
So his.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
It's a bit like you're doing it.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Frequency spectrum.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But his frequency.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
That dimension is the angle.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
OK, OK.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Is it OK?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
He's doing it.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
It will look like this.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
OK.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
But that.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because I'm doing particle physics.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
So we care more about this thing.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
That's what I just said.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
There's a group of gas in the universe.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
It's not going to work at all.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
So if we break it down.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
This is the smallest.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
This is the constituent.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
So what is it?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Elementary particle?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It can be one by one.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Very, very heavy.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
But his number is very small.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Or he can be one by one.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Very light.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
But he's very, very many.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
So in the same volume.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
It's produced in that cube.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
The quality inside is the same.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
It's in line with what we just did.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
The observation of these big gases.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I got the density of this quality.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Okay, but he's in the particle nature.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
It's going to be very different.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Now, what you see here.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
OK, this is.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
This is.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
This quality unit.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
So if you're in this background.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You don't have to explain to me.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
What is EV?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
If you don't know this.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
What unit is this EV?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I'll give you a sense.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
From this K to M.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Sorry.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
From this K to M, this neighborhood.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It's the X-ray that you usually take.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
OK.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
If you're in this.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
This is not.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
This is just the unit.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
EV this range.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It's visible light.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Energy and quality can be exchanged.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So the strength of this energy.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
This is visible light.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
This is X-ray.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
And then this is very, very powerful.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
And then this is here.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It's very, very light.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's like coming here.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
It might be the usual.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
The radio wave on the phone.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
And then go further.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
It's very, very light.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Light to the particle.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
The length of the material wave can be long.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
This kind of astronomical scale.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
OK.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Okay, so this is.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
This mass.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
OK, this dark matter candidate mass.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
And then what's below?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It's all kinds of us now.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
This theory.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
And then you can see that this is almost.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
You can go to the sky and say whatever you want.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It's the heaviest you can get.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
This is the unit of solar mass.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
He can't use this EV anymore.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
But if we cut this part out and look at it.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
From here to the other end.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
It's dozens of orders of magnitude.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
OK.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
We don't know this thing at all.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Basically, we don't know this thing at all.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
What is it?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
OK.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Good.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
So here's a lot of this model.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
That.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Uh, now I'm going to draw this orange frame.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
OK, this frame.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Sorry.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It can be said that in the past 30 or 40 years.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
All I want to know is the particle.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
The experiment of dark matter is focused on this frame.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
There's a reason for this frame.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
The top line of this frame.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
There's a theoretical top line called Unitary Bond.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
If this single particle of this dark matter.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
If it's heavier than this one up here.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
He will, uh, have this mathematical theoretical problem.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That is to say, it will exceed Unitary.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I don't know why, but OK.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So, in theory, we can say that he won't go beyond this.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Unless he looks really weird.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
For example, he is a black hole or something.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
This thing is going to be astronomical observation.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
That's what we're not going to talk about on the single particle.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
OK, what's next?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
You can see that this is a very clear picture here.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
What does it mean?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
It's his interaction, or his own quality.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Or the energy he can carry.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
It's probably in this weak interaction.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
The energy scale of this interaction.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
He has a very strong reason.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I'll talk about it later.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
But you can see that the more important thing is.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
So all the design of the experiment.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Including, uh, in the collision machine.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Whether it's a Japanese collision machine, a European collision machine.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
China may build a collision machine in the future.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Everyone is basically aiming at this orange box.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Find Dark Matter inside.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
What about all the experiments that don't do this collider?

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
Basically, now the major experiments are also in this box.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
OK, but you can see it right away.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
There are 30 orders of magnitude here.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
It's only less than one-tenth.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
OK, so why do they aim at this box?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Let's talk about it first.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
What kind of technology is this limit?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Or what kind of technology are they based on?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
They will focus on this box.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
In fact, the concept of measuring Dark Matter is very simple.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
It's like hitting a ball.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
OK, this is the earth.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Then this is us.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Then we took some of the materials that people can manipulate.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
To do any of our experimental equipment.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
Then these equipment are nothing more than a bunch of seeds and seeds.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Here is a seed or seed.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
The earth is in the solar system.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The solar system is in the galactic system.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Then the galactic system is full of what I just said.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
The gas of Dark Matter is drifting in the entire galactic system.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
So when our solar system revolves around the center of the galactic system.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
We are constantly like being blown by the wind of Dark Matter.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
OK, so at this time, if we take this seed and seed.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
To build an experiment on the earth.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Dark Matter will keep going through.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
We think it's very, very small.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Of course, we haven't measured it yet.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
But it is likely to exist.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
It won't just go through.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
It will hit our experiment and then bounce away.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
At this time, there will be some of this dynamic being picked up.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
On this seed or seed.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Then we will measure this seed or seed.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
We can know how heavy it is.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Hit down.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It will pick up such a large amount of energy.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
We call it Recall Energy.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
OK, let's bring all the numbers in.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
We probably know that.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Dark Matter to choose.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
How fast we blow the wind of Dark Matter.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
OK, so we know how heavy the seed or seed is.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Then we can be different.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
This hypothetical Dark Matter Mass.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
To calculate how much energy we can pick up.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
We pick up this recall energy.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
The most efficient scenario is exactly the same as hitting the ball.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
If there is a very heavy thing today.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Hit a very light thing.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Or a very light thing.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Hit a very heavy thing.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
The speed of the two people is almost unchanged.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
So this will not pick up energy.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
But the most efficient time.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
It's the thing that comes across.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
With the thing that is hit.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
The two of them are almost just right.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
So let's estimate that.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
OK, if we assume now.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Hit Dark Matter.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
The quality of this particle.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Exactly.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
It's with us to do this experiment.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
The seed is just as heavy.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
What about the energy that he transferred?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
It's probably an X-ray energy.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
So if we can build an experiment today.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
We can measure X-ray.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
This energy.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
We can probably measure this kind of Dark Matter.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
What's the problem here?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
This is high school physics.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Okay, no problem, I'll go on.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Then you assume the weight of the dark matter.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Because all of your detectors are magnets.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's similar.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Isn't that like this?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
You have a predicted dark matter.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
It's about the same weight as a magnet.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Okay, this is a very good question.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I'll talk about it later.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
You can imagine.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
So if Dark Matter today.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
It's a super-heavy thing.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Or a super-light thing.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
I say relatively compared to.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
For example, Proton.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
It's a super-heavy or super-light thing.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
It hits.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Your experiment doesn't actually pick up any energy.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Right?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Yeah, or it's super light.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Yeah, he's gone.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah, that's right.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That's what it is.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
So you can say.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Use an order of magnitude estimate.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Just say OK.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
So you use this kind of target particle.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Basically.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
You set yourself up first.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
It's probably in this order of magnitude.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
To measure the weight of this particle.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
If it's heavy or light, you won't be able to measure it.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Because the energy transfer will become small.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Right?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
All right, yeah, all right.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Okay, let's go back to the other side.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Well, in general, if you go to a dark matter meeting.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
This is what people usually see.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
What is this picture?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
This picture is.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
This is the imaginary.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Dark Matter Mass.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
From here is the 10 to the negative 5 times of the GV to the 10 to the 3 times of the GV.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Uh, okay.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Okay, so what about these 10 lines?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
It's an already completed experiment.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Sorry.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
What about these long lines?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It's about to be released.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Uh, the results of the experiment that will be released in a few years.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Okay, what about those dots?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
It's something like conceptual design.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Or something like, uh.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Calculate it out and say I project.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
If I have completed this concept, where can I go?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
It's not so realistic.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Okay, so I'm going to draw a line here.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
It means that I'm done with this experiment and I'm going to put it all back on top.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Okay, what does that mean?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
It means.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I open my experiment and then I keep waiting and waiting and waiting.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I know how long I've been waiting.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I know how heavy my experiment is.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Therefore, I know how many protons or neutrons I have waiting there.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Wait for a long time.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I didn't wait for anything.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
So I can say.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
How big is it according to my experiment?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
How long have I been waiting?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
And then I didn't see anything.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I can say with enough confidence.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Dark matter passes through me.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
The probability of being blocked.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
It's not going to be more than a number.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Otherwise, I should see something.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
This sentence is a bit long.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Can you understand?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Okay, so based on.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
I didn't see any results of the experiment.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
But I know very clearly.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
How long have I been waiting?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
How many things did I use to block?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Can't block.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
So I can say.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Dark matter and protons and neutrons.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
The probability of interaction will not exceed a number.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Then I can.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
For each different assumption.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
The quality of dark matter.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
To calculate a number.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
So in the end, it's a line.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Then I'll empty it out here.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Draw it black.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
That is to say.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Okay, dark matter.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
The interaction.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
If today is.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
If it's EEV.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It's definitely not.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The interaction is 10 to 40.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Must be smaller.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
If it's bigger.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I should see it.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
OK.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
So these lines are what it means.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
So you can see.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
The current limit is.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
This way.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
That is to say.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
We have to keep going down.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Keep digging down.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Until one day we see.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Dark matter really.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Always in the detector.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
it is good.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Then.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Go back to the question that Ted just asked.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Now all the experiments here.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
There is sensitivity.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
You can measure.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
You can set a limit.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Constraint like this.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
But it's probably around here.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
It's all gone.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And then there's almost no way to measure it any lower.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Why?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Because all of these experiments.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
It's all paper and seeds.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
To block dark matter.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So for these.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Lighter possible dark matter.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
When it hits.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
The remaining energy is very small.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
In these experiments.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
It can't be measured.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
OK, I can't measure it.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Then I can't say.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
What should I do here?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
So there's a threshold here.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Further down.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
We can't measure dark matter.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
This is the first point.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
The second point.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
There's a yellow one down here.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
A very large piece of stuff.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
What is this?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
This is a constant.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
The seeds of the earth.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Now all the experimental design.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Basically, there is no clear.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
The way is to say.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I can be very efficient.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Distinguish between dark matter and seeds.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
The difference in this signal.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
So if I keep digging today.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
I keep going down.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Keep drawing.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
It's about this long.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Here.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
If I keep drawing here.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Dig it out.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I still don't see the dark matter.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Next, I'll go crazy.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
There's always a signal.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
But I probably will.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
We all think.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Oh, that should be the sun.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
It's coming out.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Or the radioactivity of the earth.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Out of the seeds.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
We can't do it again.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Continue to measure this part.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
At least in the foreseeable future.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
No technology can do this.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
OK.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Why are these experiments still so focused?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Dig this part.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
For example, from 10GbE to 50EbE.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
That's the reason.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Now I'm going to draw these models.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You can see it.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
It's full of models here.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
That's what I just said.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
It can even extend to 10 to 30.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
No problem.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
But all of this.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
What you can dig here is MSSM.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
This is called super symmetry theory.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Between the 1980s and 2000s.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
Everyone is very confident about super symmetry theory.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I think it might be.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
It's a very important theory.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
It also provides a variety of variations.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
It depends on what kind of super symmetry theory you are.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
The dark matter candidate.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
So everyone is confident.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
But keep digging.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
But in fact, the earliest version of super symmetry theory.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
In fact, its prediction should be around 10 to 38.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
It's already been dug up.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
And be ruled out by more than 10 orders of magnitude.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
So much.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
OK, so now we see this P or C or N.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
What about this super symmetry theory?

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
It's all very fine-tuned.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
OK, so now we generally think.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
OK.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Within 5 to 10 years.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
These experiments will be completed.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
The dotted line they draw.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Unless we are either in this range.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
We found the document.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
Otherwise, these experiments are based on technology.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
There will probably be a lot of difficulty.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Extend down.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Because it will meet neutrino.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
This is the first point.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
The second point is.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
In fact, if you are.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
It's a theory that needs to be very natural.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Not very artificially.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
To find a very difficult to produce.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
The combination of parameters.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
In fact, those natural.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Theoretical prediction.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
It's already been dug up.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
OK.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But back to this point.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
In fact, there are still a lot of models down here.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
OK.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
So we want to do.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Uh.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
We want to find better technology.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
In addition to digging here.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
We want to be able to cover the remaining dozens.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
This order of magnitude is not measured at all.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
Or it's hard to measure.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
OK.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
So what are we going to do?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I just said.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
We want to block a very light particle.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
We can't use a very heavy magnet or seed to block it.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Because of this.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
This energy will be very little.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So that's another thing that humans can control.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
In addition to the magnet and the seed is the electron.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
In fact, there is not much else.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
OK.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Then I change it to an electron now.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
OK.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Then I bring the number in.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
The electron is instantly 100 times lighter than the magnet and the seed.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
No, sorry.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
1,000 times.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
2,000 times.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Almost 2,000 times.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
To a very, very light quality.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
So now I can block it.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
The energy consumed is probably.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
I can be sensitive to 100EV.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
That's dozens of EV.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Let's talk about dozens of EV.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
But if you use a magnet.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
It's hundreds of EVs that can be measured.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That is to say, if I want to eat more.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Eat this light particle more efficiently.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Give me the energy.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I have to use light things to block.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
So our idea now is.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Electron as the target of being hit.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
OK.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Okay, because he's an electron.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
So he actually has another interaction.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
He will directly put the light.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Light is the electromagnetic wave.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
So if there is a model today.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Is.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Will convert to light or light.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
He will absorb it all.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
At this time, it is not the opposite.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
And then eat some of the energy.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
But we will put all this energy.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Just like his quality, so much energy.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
The quality will become his energy.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Eat it all.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Then we can also measure this.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
If you use electrons.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
OK.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
So we are now.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I think we should use electrons.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
To replace the straight and neutral.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
To produce for lighter particles.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
This sensitivity.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Then we will.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It's a definition of this talk.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
That is to say, we will talk about low mass later.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Low mass is probably GEV.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Or lighter particles.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Then emphasize it again.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
There are so many here.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
For example, dark sector.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
This is the metric.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Freezing, etc.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
OK.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Of course, there are.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Uh.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
We are still experimenting with this.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I just talked about this.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
The mechanism of hitting the ball.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
But in fact.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
For example, like the theory.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Uh, he predicted that.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
There will be very natural.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Can produce this.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It's not a particle at all.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It's more like a bunch of.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
That's like this.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
We can actually measure it.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
But of course we have to assume that.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Assuming he's going to do this.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
This kind of behavior.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Then we can use this method to measure.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So in other words, we can.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
If there is such a behavior.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
What is his probability?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
That's for me.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Uh, like we do experiments.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
A more important point is.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
How do we really.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
To do such an experiment realistically.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Like I just said.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
We want to maximize this.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Momentum energy transfer.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
So we have to be very light.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
This target the particle.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Of course, we want very small, very small noise.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
OK, because of this.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
We can only see a very small signal.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
So there will be enough.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Signal to noise ratio.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
OK.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Back to just now.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
We want the sensitivity of sub-Kev.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
OK.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
It takes a few tens of EVs.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Probably below.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Then do this.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
GEV or lighter particle.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
To see things.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
OK.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Of course, there is also a very important thing.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
We must be able to know very clearly.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
The signal I see now.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
It's from the Dark Matter hit me.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Instead of inexplicably.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Things in the environment hit my detector.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
But if the energy is very high today.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
This thing is relatively easy.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Because of this kind of energy in the environment.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
This kind of radioactivity.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
In fact, relatively few.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Otherwise, in fact, people are dead.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
OK, but if you reduce the energy to very low.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
In fact, you are next to the phone.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Cell phone signal.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
It looks like that energy.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
If you put it in an experimental environment.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
The temperature of the experimental environment.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Black radiation.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
That light is also this energy.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
So it started to become very, very much.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Low-energy particle.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Keep hitting the detector.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
We need to be able to distinguish.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That's the only way to do this.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
So in fact, it is relatively challenging.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
OK.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I won't talk about this picture.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
This picture is actually the thing.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Ok.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Ok, I'm done.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
The first part is our motivation.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Do you have any questions?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Hello.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Do you hear me?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Yes, yes, yes.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Then I want to.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I'm the one who does Neoscience.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
So I don't have a background.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
But I want to ask.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
That's how everyone is.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Is it that?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Neutrino.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Oh.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
How do you do it?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Is it?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Is it?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Neutrino.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
This question.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Is it?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
OK.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
You say.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
What if it's Neutrino?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
How do you do it?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Because the sun will emit a lot.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
That's right.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
This question can actually be divided into two.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
The first one is.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
I'm not sure.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
What you want to ask is.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
How do we know?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Neutrino can't be a dark matter.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
How do we know?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
How do we know?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
How do we know?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
How do we know?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
How do we know?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
How do we know?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
How do we know?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Neutrino can't be a dark matter?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
It's still our detector.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
What about the signal you see is not Neutrino?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
How do you know?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
If you have to first exclude.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
If you have to first exclude.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Is it possible that Neutrino is not?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
And then do this experiment near the Earth to make it feasible?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Because the sun if it is.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
The sun is not a very strong interferer.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
That's right.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
That's right.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Okay.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
The first point.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
We can use the solar system.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
The solar system.

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
Why is it called Neutrino now?

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
This is that.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Neutrino's distribution is not the same, is it?

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
But why is Neutrino's distribution the same in all three cases?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
It's because of the black matter in it.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Black matter is functional.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
There's no our detector has the data.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
You are now with us.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
More swing neutrino.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Neutrino does not form, and now it's coming.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Linking together.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Really?

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Then let's talk about the dark matter.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
It takes a long, long time.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
It will slowly gather into what we want now.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
The density of the spider web I just showed.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Then attract other particles in.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
That time is far more than we know.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The age of the universe so far.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Then the amount of planets produced.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
So we know that such a light particle.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Then its interaction is like Neutrino.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Because we actually know a lot about Neutrino.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
But it's a good feeling.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
But that is to say.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
We know the strength of its interaction.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
So we know.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
It can't be the dark matter we want.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
OK, unless there's another version of Neutrino.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
That's not.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
That's also new physics.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
So we know Neutrino.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
The first is not to do dark matter.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
The second is if today.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
OK, then the sun will still shoot.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
We know that kind of Neutrino.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
How do we know?

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
The signal we see is not Neutrino.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
The answer is we don't know.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
But we know one thing.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
We know how hot the sun is.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
We know how much light it emits.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
We also know almost.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
The principle of emitting this light is.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Which few.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
The chain of fusion reactions.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
So we know.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Based on its brightness, its heat.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Look at these fusion reactions.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
It emits the flux of Neutrino.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
How much should that flow be?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Plus we know.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
This kind of Neutrino through our detector.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
What is the probability of being blocked?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
OK, so we know.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Now the detector sees.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It won't be.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It won't be Neutrino.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Because in theory, in the whole experiment.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
The duration will be blocked.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Maybe it's a few zeros.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
In other words, it won't be blocked.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
So we know there's no problem.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
But based on what I just said.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I know how hot the sun is.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
So how many Neutrino have been through the earth.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Through our experiment.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
When our experiment is getting more and more sensitive.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Can be sensitive to.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
It's worth 47, 48.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
For example, here.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
48, 49.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
At this time, we will be very sensitive.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
To be able to see that kind of Neutrino.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
At this time, we see any signal.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
We can't say.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
It is Dark Matter or Neutrino.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So here to dig this yellow line.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
This is what I said.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
The experiment will stop here.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Because we basically don't have it now.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Reliable technology can tell.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Is it Neutrino or Dark Matter?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
OK.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Thank you.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
But in fact, there is a potential way.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
If I can distinguish its direction.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
They all come from the sun.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Then I will say that people from the sun.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
The probability of Neutrino is very high.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I don't look over there.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
OK.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
But what I'm talking about now is.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
When this particle hits.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
The energy it leaves.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
We only measure energy.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
We didn't measure.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The direction of this incoming particle.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
So in fact.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Unless I can identify this thing.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Otherwise, I can't tell Neutrino.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
The answer is no.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
OK.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Excuse me.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Can I ask another question?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Please say.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Just.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Because I don't understand this at all.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
That.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
That is, the particle accelerator can.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Can.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Can.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Think of a way to find these heavy particles.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Heavy quality particles.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
That.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
But for example.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Very light particles.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Is there no way to find it with an accelerator?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
So.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
You are looking for Dark Matter.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Assuming this.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
This.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
There is a very light particle.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Then it could also be Dark Matter.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
You may.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
You are looking for Dark Matter.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
It may also be.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Solve this.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
For example, find a particularly light particle.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Then.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Maybe the theory can't be predicted.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Or.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Some theories have been predicted.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
That's it.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
But I don't know.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Yes.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So in fact, the accelerator can find Dark Matter.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
And a lot of people are looking for Dark Matter in the accelerator.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
But.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Looking for Dark Matter in the accelerator.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Like you said.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
In fact, basically.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
The concept is completely different.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
It is.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
You use your known example.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Think of a way.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Create Dark Matter.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Right.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
But.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
It has a very, very practical reason.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
It's very difficult to do in the accelerator.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
That is.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
You take two examples you already know.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Put it together.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Explode.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
In addition to producing a Dark Matter.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
It will produce a lot of other examples.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
In other words.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Your.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Next to these.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
After measuring these explosions.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
These products.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
These detectors.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
It's like being constantly.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
It's like being constantly.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
It's like being constantly.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
It's like being constantly.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
It has a certain amount of brightness.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
As long as you do it.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
It will produce a lot of this.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
This kind of showering.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
This kind of background.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
That.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You basically can't see it.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
If you want to see something.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It's smaller than the background of this shower.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Because what you see is bright.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
So.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Because of the mechanism of the confrontation.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Their lower threshold is probably hundreds of GV.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
It's probably here.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
So.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
It's probably the accelerator.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Probably the best.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Is.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
From here.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Above.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
They can say with confidence.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
If I see something.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
It's Dark Matter.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
But they didn't see it either.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
So they're also drawing a line.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
But down here.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
They can't have that confidence.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
They can't have that confidence.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Say I didn't see it.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Because their environment is too bright.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
No, it's too big.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
But that's right.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
You can find it in the accelerator.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Ok.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Ok.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Ok.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Ok.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Ok.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Ok.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Ok.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Ok.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Ok.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Ok.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Ok.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Ok.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Ok.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Is there a problem?

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Is there a problem?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
So.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
So.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
My question is.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
That.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Uh.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
I mean.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
That is to say.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Standard model.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Also.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Also.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
That is to say.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Assuming there is a lighter example.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
That.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Uh-huh.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Not only in the accelerator.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I can't see it.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
That standard model.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
I didn't predict it either.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
But again.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
That's right.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
In fact.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
There is.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Uh.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
There is a high possibility of Dark Matter.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
That's it.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
So.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Uh.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
So.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
You are looking for Dark Matter.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
If you find a lighter model.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Standard model.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
I can't predict it.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
That.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Of course.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
It's a new.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
New.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
New.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
New.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Physics.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Is that right?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Correct.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
As long as we see Dark Matter.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
It must be new physics.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Ok.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Because Dark Matter itself.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
It's not in the Standard Model at all.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Ok.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Ok.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Correct.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Ok.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Ok.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Ok.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Hello.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Hello.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Uh.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Ian seems to have a problem.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Ian.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Hello.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Because I can't see the projection now.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
So you have to read it for me.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Hey.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Ian.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
You have to turn on the microphone.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
To ask.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Can't see.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Can't see.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Do you want to talk?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Ah.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Ok.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
He said that.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Assuming.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Oh.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Uh.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Assuming now.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Dark Matter.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Uh.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Uh.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Uh.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Uh.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Uh.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Uh.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Uh.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Uh.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Uh.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Uh.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Yeah.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
OK.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
He only said.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
I have to turn back for my microphone.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
On the sound history.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
He can finally speak.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Then there may be time to turn back.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Because...

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
The moment he speaks simple.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
He wants to make.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
You have to be able to say everything in English.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
What?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
What are you saying.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
It's OK.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Don't need to be altered.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
It doesn't matter.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
It's OK.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
You only have to be able to.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
You worked hard.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
It's OK.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
We'll do this.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
And there's another question.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Yes.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Which is.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Which is.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
What Light matter model.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Is considered to be without dark matter.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Is considered.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Oh, no.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Yes, this is his question.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
This thing is like this.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Just.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
You take something very heavy.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
To hit something very light.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
What will the result be?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
You take something very heavy.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Hit something very light.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
We can imagine.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Take a truck.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Hit a window.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
The light is hit very far.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Yes.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
In fact.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
The first signal you see.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
It will be completely Nonsense.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Will be super big.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Then it's gone.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
But in fact.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
He just went through.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
He won't leave the energy.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Sorry.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Uh.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
I just said it wrong.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Because he will go straight through.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
He won't put energy.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
So he transferred the energy.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
It will still be very strong.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Uh.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
I have an equation here.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
OK.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
So this.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
This is that equation.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
That is to say.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
If you go to calculate.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
He left.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Hit.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Hit.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Because in fact.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Hit is the two people.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Common response.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
He doesn't care.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Who hit who.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Because in fact.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
In his execution.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
They are hit.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
You can't tell who hit who.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
The most effective way.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Is to hit.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Hit.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Hit.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Hit.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
The most effective way to pass energy to.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Another person.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Is.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Big M is greater than small M.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
But whether it is.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Big M is greater than small M.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Or is small M greater than big M.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
This number will be close to zero.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
That is to say.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
You won't leave the energy.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
So.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
This question is more like.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
If today.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Dark Matter.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Really move like a proton.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Then we use electron.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Is it a good candidate?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
The answer is no.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Because we will leave.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Very, very small energy.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
We still can't measure.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
But this thing.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Effectively.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Is all these experiments.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
What to do.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
But they didn't see anything.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
So.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
I want to try.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
I have a question.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
I want to ask.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
You just said.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
We can control.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Just.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Of course.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
At first.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Use paper.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
More.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
More people use.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
The method.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Then.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Because I can't find it.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
So use electrons.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
So you.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
You just said.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
We can control.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Paper and electrons.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
What do you mean by control?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
What does it mean?

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
If.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
I said control.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
In fact, it is.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
You can spend money.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Easy to buy materials.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
OK.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
So.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
OK.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Yes.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
I will talk about some.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
More exotic.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Yes.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Ah.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
If the electronic.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
If you can't find it.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Is it possible to use electricity?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Because in fact.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Electricity.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Electricity and electricity.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
In fact.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
It's about the same.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
No.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
OK.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
OK.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Percentage.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
That's about the same to me.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
What we're talking about now is.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
If you can find.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Smaller things.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
For example, that kind.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Uh.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
What is it called?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Dirac.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
It's super.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
So effectively.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
You can destroy one.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
For example.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Quasi-particle.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
That's all possible.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
But.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Very.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Expensive.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Ah.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Yes.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Good.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
OK.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
That.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
OK.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Good.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Then I'll talk about it first.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
That is.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Super CDMA.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
HPEV detector.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
This thing.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
What is it?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Ahem.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Ahem.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
OK.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Sorry.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Good.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Now here you see a picture.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
This picture.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Is trying to describe this.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Germanium.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
This.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
The crystal.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
OK.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
It's a gold.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Black.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
That's the white line.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Like this.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Hit him.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Then bounce away.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
OK.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Then he left some energy.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
What about this energy?

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Will come out.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Ahem.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
This will come out.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Shake this.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
This crystal lattice.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
So he'll shake there.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Vibrate.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
That vibrates this thing.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
It's actually a.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Signal.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
It's called Fona.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
OK.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
And then.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
At the same time, he'll hit this.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Electronic electric team.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Because he has enough energy.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
He can.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
He's next to the electronic electric team.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Sorry.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
So.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Hey.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Then we have two signals.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Can measure.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
One is this.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Lattice vibration.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
It's called Fona.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Ah.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
The other one is this.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Electronic electric team.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Ah.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
So now.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
How do you do it?

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
It's just that we put a big piece of this.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Crystal.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
This is.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
10 centimeters.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
OK.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
This is 10 centimeters.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
What about its thickness?

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
It's 4.5 centimeters.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
It's 5 centimeters.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
It's a big piece.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
You don't seem to be any.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
The thickness of silicon used by TSMC.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
It's a big one.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
And then.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Let's take this thing.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Let it work.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Ah, when it's hit by Jack Berry.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
At the time.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
These fans will drift to it.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
This one.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
To Spread to this.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
This crystal surface.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
This one.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Hey, this electron pair is, too.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
We'll pull it to the surface of a power plant.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
What about now?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
We're on this surface.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Do this microbi Britt consideration.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
We're doing a guided circuit.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
So, we're going to use this sugar to rival the arrows.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Interrupted by these two signals.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
It really changes to measure the two clicks.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
First, we calculate it.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
We calculate pi 2025 by zeros.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
And then we measure pi.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Well, we can adjust it.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
Interrupt change to measure the Bacon and that organization.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Okay, this is the concept.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
Okay, then he's got a lot of them in our video to do a different operation mode.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
But what I want to talk about first is this.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I don't next to meet you.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Well, it's real, it's a side classical.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
Now, come in hop okay.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Generate an otmomert here.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
It's all electronic.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
Okay, and then I'm here to give him a super big power plant.

43:35.000 --> 43:43.000
Okay, then he's going to pull this electronic and electric, and he's going to rush up and down here very quickly.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Okay, and in the process?

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
Because this electronic electric will be far more than he can travel in this lattice.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
The highest terminal velocity.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
So what he's going to do is he's going to start generating.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.000
He's going to lose or he's going to generate more energy into this.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
Crystal inside to balance his speed, he's going to stay at terminal velocity.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
So you're going to have a lot of this green arrow.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
This is a secondary phenomenon.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
Okay, so you can imagine if we give him a super big bias voltage.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
He's going to generate a lot of wind.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
So we basically just put an electronic electric signal.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Let him become a big power plant.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Let him become a super big wind signal.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
And then we use this method to recover.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
Oh, so we created a few electronic electric teams in front of us.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Okay, so we're going to use this method.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
We just have to give him a few dozen to a hundred or two hundred volts of this power difference.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
Then he can produce dozens of times to a hundred or two hundred times of this.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
This is our approach.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
Then we basically measure this purple piece, which is the sensor.

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
Okay, this is a piece of paper we published last year.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
We made an R&D device.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
This device is 2 centimeters.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
This edge is 2 centimeters.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
This is a silicon crystal.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
It's 4 kilometers thick.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
So it's 0.4 centimeters.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Then we added him.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
We added him 150 volts of this.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
Okay, so we're going to use this high voltage method to generate a lot of secondary.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Then we use this piece of silver.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
I'll talk about it later.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
To measure this wind.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
Okay, so we can use this method.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
What we get is this signal to noise ratio.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
It's 0.7 percent of the electronic whole pair.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
For example, this is a single electron hole.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
This is a horizontal energy.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
Then the axis is the histogram.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
It doesn't matter what it is.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
This is a single electron hole pair.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
This is a signal of two, three, four electron hole pairs.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
And what about its width?

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
It's about 7 percent.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
That's what it means.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
So we have resolution to see.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
Counting this single, single, single, electron hole pair.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
Okay, so we found that we can do it without fear.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Add this bias voltage to super big.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
We can't see the super, super big signal to noise ratio.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
The answer is no.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
Because when we add more than one breakdown voltage.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
This whole crystal becomes like a semiconductor.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
It's like an island.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
It's been crazy, it's been passing through.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
It will smear.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
We can count this dark matter signal ability.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
So we do this breakdown voltage.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
We found that we don't want to go beyond this breakdown voltage.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
We operate at the bottom of the breakdown voltage.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
We see that it will always have two or three hertz like this.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Two or three signals every second.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
Then keep coming out, keep coming out.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
The part that comes out is the pink part.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
It's completely different from what we expect.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
The signal that dark matter can produce is different.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
So our assumption is that.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
OK, there's a background here.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
We don't know why.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
It keeps leaking.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
OK, but we don't know.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
But based on such a background.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
We can also set a limit.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Is it consistent with this background being or not?

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
OK, I'm going to do this calculation.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
What about the calculation?

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
You can see the picture in the upper right corner.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
OK, CDMS Run 1.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I just said.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
In traditional experiments, we are all at 10 GeV.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Or higher to a few TeV to draw this limit.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
But now I'm going back to the experiment.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
We put this detector in our refrigerator.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Then I gave it a day and a night.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Then this detector is very small.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
This detector is as big as a rubber band.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
OK, we immediately set a world leading limit.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
What is the world leading limit?

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
It's very simple.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
It's not very sensitive to the very bottom.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
It can measure very small probability.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
It's just because we can be sensitive to very small energy.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So we drew a place where no one has ever been able to draw.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
OK, you can see this place.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
This is sub-mEV.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
So 1 GeV is here.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
10 GeV is what I said.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
WIMP Search is from here to the right.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
So we immediately drew a big piece here.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
This is last year.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
OK, let's say this is just a demonstration.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
This concept is very efficient.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Then we are this year.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
OK, we have to be very formal.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
Let's make this thing a measurement on the ground.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Then we are actually yesterday.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
We just unblinded all our data.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
So we should be within a month.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Everyone doesn't have to sleep on Christmas.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
Then we will put the pair on the archive.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
So there will be a new one in a month.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Then stay tuned.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
I can't talk about numbers, but I can say.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
We redesigned this R&D device.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Because we are from here.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Then go over here and compare it.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
Theoretically, this should be a resolution detector.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Then we see the difference.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Then we understand it.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
We redesigned.

49:04.000 --> 49:10.000
Then the resolution is significantly improved.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
Then what's more important is.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Back to just now.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Because I said it would have two or three hertz of leakage.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Because I don't understand this leakage.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
So if there is a leakage to a certain extent.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
I said OK.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Then cut it off here.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
The above is a good detector.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
It's hard for me to say anything below.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Because my background is too high.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
So the most important, the most crucial, is to set a limit.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
In fact, it is to reduce this leakage.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Then we are actually Achieve Leakage Current Reduction Goal.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
So this is very important.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
What's more interesting is.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
We have been in this year or so.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
In fact, nearly two years.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
We know more about Silicon Crystal.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Interaction with its environment.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
So we can model.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
That is, these can be produced.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Not quantized signal.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
What is the distribution?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Then we can model it.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
So basically, I can say.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
We project to set again.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
We're leading limit.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
If not discovery.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
So stay tuned.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
This is what happens.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Okay, so here is CDMSHVEV.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Is there a problem?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
This is a concept.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Because it's more like saying.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I want to talk about technology later.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
But if you have any questions about this part.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
You can ask now.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
OK, if you don't have any questions.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Welcome to take a look.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
This 180410697.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
This, right.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
It should be HVEV and Sensai.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Are the two that can be set to the lowest.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
What is this called?

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
Gathering the cross-section experiment.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Right.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Okay.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Then go down.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
The rest of the part I want to talk about is this.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Before I talk about it.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I want to talk about it first.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
In the detector I just showed.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
What is his technology?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
OK, now you see a little.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
A little, a little, a little, a little.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
It's a piece of metal.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Then we put it in this.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
It will become a super conductor.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
OK, then.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
If there is a pink part today.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
The pink part is just that.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
The big piece of that.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
If I produce this interaction today.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Then it will float up.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Then go into this silver part.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
OK, it will destroy this.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Then this will float in all the way.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
What about this floating in?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Sorry, it destroys.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
It's called QP.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Then it will change this.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
The state of the conductor.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
OK, it will be from.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
This is the original conductor.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
The horizontal axis is the conductor.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
The horizontal axis is the effective temperature.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
That little silver effective temperature.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
OK, he was originally a zero conductor.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Will be very fast transition to.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
There are nine conductors.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
It's a normal conductor.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Then we just put it.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
In this state of this transition.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
As long as there is a little temperature.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Or the change of energy in this film.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
This little inside.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
We can see a big signal.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
We use this method to measure.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
But there are some problems.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
His problem is.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
This is a phase transition.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
So his range is very small.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
From a little energy to.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
It's full, it's just a little bit.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
So his dynamic range.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Is very small.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
That's usually what you need.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Extra.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Circuit.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And it's going to be in the fridge.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
To help him dissipate energy.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Or help him divert that energy.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Feedback, so we can.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
It's really stable.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Operate our detector in this.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Transition.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
And then, because he's actually a film.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
He's from a zero conductor to a conductor.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
It's also a super small conductor.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
So he's a conventional.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
The impedance of this electronics.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Is not match.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
So he usually requires.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
This is a cryo electronics.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
To do this.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
When it's time to do it.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Low impedance match.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
So this is usually.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
This is a very troublesome thing.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
And the most important thing is.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Typical can be used to do this.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Transition edge sensor material.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
It's actually not suitable.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Come to this.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
So it really has to be produced.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
A ts sensor that can catch phonon.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
We also have a trapper.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Put these phonons.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Let him run over there, so there are several layers.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Then this micro fabrication is very complicated.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Then why do I want to talk about those?

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Because those are basically this kid.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
The problem of the customer service.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Then I'll talk about how to do it.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
This operation is good.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
The same energy comes in today.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
This picture is the earliest paper.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
He was imagined to be hit by light.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
But you can imagine.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
After he broke up.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
He's on that.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
The effect of the metal on it.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
It's not just the change of the conductor.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It will also produce.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
The change of the electric sense.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
The change of the electric sense and the change of the conductor is not the same.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
The superconductor.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
It's been produced all the time.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
He won't have a conductor.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Until the transition.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Suddenly, a lot of changes.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
And then he went to the normal state.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
But if today is.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Inductance.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
The change of being broken.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
In fact, it is relatively low function.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
He can operate at a lower temperature.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
That is to say, as long as I have one.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Enough ice in the refrigerator.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
The transition temperature is much lower than mine.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I can operate.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
In fact, I do not need to care.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Do I have a very complicated electronic?

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Can control it?

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
This is very important.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
What I'm talking about today is the change of the electric sense.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
How do we make it a good sensor?

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
This is a variable electric sense.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I put it together with a capacitor.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
It becomes a vibrator.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
OK, so if today.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
This electric sense is.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Eat a little energy.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
A little change.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
That's frequency space today.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
OK, so frequency space.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
This is F, this is S21.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
If you do micro wave S21.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Then there is a resonance.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
He will run.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
And because there are more inside.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
This thermodynamic activity.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
In fact, it is a quasi-particle recombination.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
So this resonator.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Or this resonator.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
This quality factor will be reduced.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
So it's not just this.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Resonance frequency will run.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Its fat will become fat.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
So it will be like this.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
From this black to the dot, then run back.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Then we look at this.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
OK, we will know that.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Oh, here is the signal.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
In fact, how do we realize such a circuit?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Actually nothing.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Just put it all together.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
We have a lot of this little.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
LC, LC, LC.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Then put it all together.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Then I measured its transmission.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Or S21.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I just put all these.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
These resonators.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
The resonant frequency is slightly adjusted to be different.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Then I measured S21 today.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
You will see one by one.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
One by one, one by one, one by one, one by one.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
OK, then this resonance.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Will map to, for example, I know.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
By design, this person.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
He should resonate at this frequency.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
This person should resonate at this frequency.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
So I just monitor this one.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I know he was hit.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
This one runs.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I know he was hit.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
So this.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
This is how we do this pixelization.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
This concept.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
In fact, you can see that this is a waveguide.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Then this is a.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Electrical circuit.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Then this is a capacitor.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
This waveguide is coupled to it.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
This waveguide is coupled to it.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
In fact, everyone will see it like this.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
There is a waveguide here.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
OK.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Then every little island.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
It's all a pixel.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Sorry, but we can go back.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Compare to say.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
What if you use TES?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Because the TES is too small.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Small to measure.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
You have to put a lot of this little island.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
All connected.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
So in fact, these people are all connected.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Make a sensor together.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
These people are all connected together.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
So this chip.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
2 cm by 2 cm.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
It's just two channels.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
The signals are all clamped together.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
But a 3-inch wafer like this.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
It's 80 channels.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Then we now think that 80 channels.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Do this.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Positioning is good enough.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
So we don't actually have to push this detector anymore.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
We may have to take this detector.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
To do the dark matter search.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
But we are for this thing.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Some analysis of robustness.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I don't know if there's a paper here.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
If you can go and see.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
We think we can put 200 channels.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Then there will be no confusion.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
So basically.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
This is the future super cdms no lab detector.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
There are a lot of little dots.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
But they are all connected together.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
So in the end, this big piece is a pixel.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
This big piece is a pixel.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It probably looks like this.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It has 6 pixels.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Then we have 80.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Then we can do more than 200.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Because in fact.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Energy resolution wise.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
We have measured.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Comparable energy resolution.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
But more importantly.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Recent results suggest.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
We can do sub-EB resolution.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Then of course.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
In money wise.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
It reduces 60% of fabrication complexity.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Because in fact.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
This whole piece.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Is single layer film.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Compared with this.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
We are actually a mask.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Then deposit.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Then etch.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Then we have a complete whole circuit.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
So we reduced.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
60% to 70% of this.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
If we go to calculate the steps.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Then the chemical used is much less.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
So this fabrication EO is much higher.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And we can easily do.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
100 times of this.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Pixelization.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Is multiplexibility.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Then.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
We don't need thermoelectric feedback.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
We just need to.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Make it much lower than TC.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Then we don't need.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Squid amplifier.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Because in fact by design.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
This waveguide is 50 ohms.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
So we only need 50 ohms.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Just connect two coax.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
So this is very simple.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
This is very important to CLR.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Then this is the second page.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Then let's talk about.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
How high can we expect?

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Because we are dominated by.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Low-noise amplifier.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
So in other words.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
As long as I can lower my.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
The noise temperature of the amplifier.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I can.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Increase my.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Resolution here.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Then we use this amplifier now.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
5K noise temperature.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Then our collaborator in JPL.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
He made a low-noise.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Low-noise amplifier.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So I just change this to me.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I have a factor here.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
OK.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Then.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
We found one thing.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
We have to do this match filter.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Filter what is noise.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
What is this pulse template.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
If we have this today.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
This pulse decay time.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
This time constant is longer.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
We can be on this match filter.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Filter more of this.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Noise spectrum.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Then this characteristic.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
If the characteristic time of this film becomes longer.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
We can.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Increase better signal to noise ratio.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
In this paper.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Demonstrate that they can put this time.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Increase to 3ms.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Then we are now 100 microseconds.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
So OK.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Then I put this factor in.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Do I put this factor in?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
OK.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Let's not say 3000.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Let's say 1500 microseconds.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
This is actually my boss.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Another experiment.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
They put.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
This part.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Made into material.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
What does it mean?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
He put this sensitive inductor.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Really we can measure.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Material.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
The other part.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Another kind.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
The gap is bigger.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Bigger material.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
So they won't eat the wind.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
By this difference.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Just by this geometric ratio.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
He can increase his sensitivity.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Then we can do the same thing.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
That is actually one more layer.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Much less than TS.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Then we add it up.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
This ratio.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Then.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Recently.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Recently, there is one in Europe.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Do that group.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
They are doing this thing.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
They propose a very interesting one.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
We actually have to calculate.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
How much we have created.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
So if you are today.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
This superconductor.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Very small.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Very small.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You can break a lot.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
So they used this.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Low gap.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Very small.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
This material.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
We use aluminum now.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
They can use it.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
From 0.2.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
0.2.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
0.2.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
0.05.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
This is also a change.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So we put everything.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Has been demonstrated.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Bring it all in.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
We will.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Bring in the resolution we already have.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Rescale.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The result we get is 36.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
That is to say.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
We are no longer doing.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Or we do.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Ionization counting.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
We basically have 36.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Resolution.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Of course, we can take this thing.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Take it instead of TES.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Continue to put it on the silicon substrate.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Test this.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Or this ionization.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Then we can do another thing.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Is that we put a bunch of kids over there.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Directly take the kids to the dark matter.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Then we can count.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
This kind of quantum.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
This is our plan.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Summarize.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
We think now.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Within 5 to 10 years.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Humans can either find WIMP.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Or we will have a long one.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
No progress.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So everyone is now.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Working hard to think about it.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Can we shift to low mass dark matter?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
There are still a lot of models.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Not tested yet.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
We need to have.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Two at the same time.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Because in fact.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
In addition to electronic recoil.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Can measure very small energy.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Nuclear recoil can help us distinguish.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
What is the signal?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
What is the background?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
This is an important thing to start now.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Requires substantial improvement.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
In low-threshold technology.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
This is the second part.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
CDMX HPEV demonstration.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
We have the ability to count.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
We give it a day.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
One day on the surface of the lab.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
We can set a good limit.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Of course, our detector.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Has been taken to the tunnel.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So the next round.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Will be the underground round.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
One day on the surface of the lab.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
We can constrain.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
0.4 MeV dark matter mass.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The most important thing is the KIT part.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
We demonstrate competitive energy resolution.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
The most important thing is.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It is actually.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Theoretical prediction.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
If we put all the design numbers.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It is quite consistent.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Then we are confident.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So we can adapt.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
What others have demonstrated.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Assuming we really have.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So many resources to adapt.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Each one.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Its outlook is 100 times.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Resolution improvement.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
It is.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Flexible optimization.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You want good energy resolution.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Just make a pixel.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Let all the photons hit you.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Or you can do 500 pixels.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Then you can have a good.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Position reconstruction or tracking.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
In other words.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
You can reject the background.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
When we really want to run dark matter devices.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
This will still need to be redesigned.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
And then the point is.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It is very easy and reliable fabrication.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
This is very important for the future.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Because the students know.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It is very likely that the device has not been done well.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So if it's easy to do, it's very important.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
OK.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Because it is very simple.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It basically does not have.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Just put in an amplifier.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Then you can run.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
OK, that's it.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Thank you.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Hello everyone.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Does anyone have a question?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
We are good.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Good.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Good.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Good.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Good.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Good.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Good.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Good.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Good.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Good.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Good.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Good.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I want to ask.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
That is.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Is that Ding Zhaozhong.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
His group is looking for WIMP.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And this is not even about to the device?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
To the space or test.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
The test is actually done on earth.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
If we want to.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
The environment of this experiment.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
A better environment.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Not actually going to the sky.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Because we actually measured directly.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
We hope to go through everything we already know.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
All kinds of things.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
And then hit our detector.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But our environment is full of cosmic rays.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So we actually have the best environment.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
It's underground.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It can be very natural to use the earth's shell to help us isolate the cosmic rays.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
But we already know.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Can go through almost everything.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You go to the bottom of the moon.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Relatively, you show off the more cosmic rays.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
But the rate you leave.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
That is.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
So most of our experiments are.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Eventually, it's going to be done underground.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
For example, mines and so on.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
But Ding Zhaozhong's experiment.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
If you're talking about AMS or AMS.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
What if it's 02 now?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
He's not measuring dark matter.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
He's measuring cosmic rays.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The anomaly.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And then if this anomaly.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
It's a very, very strong anomaly.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
They can try to explain.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So is there any dark matter?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
For example, decay.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Or produce such anomalies.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
For example, suddenly there is a certain kind of energy.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
On the spectrum of cosmic rays.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
There are a lot of non-continuous peaks.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Then it might be dark matter.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So they're actually measuring cosmic rays.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
So they want to go to the strongest part of the cosmic rays.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So they want to go to the atmosphere.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Because the atmosphere will actually block the cosmic rays.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So they went to the space station.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
The principle is probably like this.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
OK.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
OK.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
OK.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
OK.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
OK.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I want to ask another question.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
OK.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
It's a bit of an unexpected.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
But.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I want to ask if there is anyone.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
You're measuring those photons now.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Right?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And then magnify the signal.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Is there anyone.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Like using that legal.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
That is, he measured.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
For example, you hit it.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Then there may be some very small particles.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yes.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I actually.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I really like this kind of research.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Because.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
You can ask a very legitimate question.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
That is to say.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
In fact, we are now.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
All dark matter will be blocked by us.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Interaction is imaginary.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Because the only thing we know.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Dark matter will really interact.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Observed is through gravity.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
If I say I'm going to design an experiment.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Is to use gravity as gravity.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
To measure dark matter.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
How sensitive do I want to be?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Or what kind of model is dark matter?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I measured it.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Basically, your question is like this.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
The answer is.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Someone is thinking about this.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It's not that I can't do it.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
But the first dark matter is very, very heavy.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
How heavy is it?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It's about 0.0.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Planck's mass.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I don't know if you know Planck's mass.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
We think all gravity.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
The theory will break down the physical limit.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Now.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Now we are discussing these scales.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
What 30 times.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
No, sorry.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Then.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
This is what they are thinking about.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
They can use laser.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Put some nanoparticles.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Press it with laser light.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Hold nanoparticles.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Then take it.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Line up in a vacuum chamber.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Line up in a vacuum chamber.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
These nanoparticles.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
If the little pig is hit by dark matter.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
No, sorry.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
It is passed by dark matter.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Then the weight of the dark matter particle.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Will affect the position of these little pigs.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Then they will start to shake.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
It's like a gravity wave.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The mirror of LIGO.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
They can use this method to measure.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But I think this is a good question.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And someone is doing R&D.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
This is very interesting.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
This is very interesting.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Can I ask?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Strange details.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Why do you use such a thick wafer?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Why do you use such a thick wafer?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Or is the whole piece of silicon?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Or is the whole piece of silicon?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Yes, the whole piece is silicon.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Ok, I'll leave it here.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
In fact, this thickness is so thick.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
This is 10 cm.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
This is 4 inches.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
4 inches wafer.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
The thickness is a big piece.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
It's like a big piece of silicon.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
You don't cut it into pieces.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You cut it into pieces.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
This is not a wafer crystal.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Why do you do this?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Because we found one thing.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Of course you can say that my thickness is 1 km.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
And then I have 10 pieces.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Or my thickness is 1 cm.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
But I only have one piece.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Its total mass.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Or the total number of neutron protons it gives you.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
It's the same.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So in theory, your experimental sensitivity is the same.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
But we found one thing.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
In the whole process of fabrication.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And in the process of transportation.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
The cosmic radiation has been constantly hitting.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
The cosmic radiation has been constantly hitting.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And then there's a lot of dirt in the air.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
A lot of radioactivity has also been touching our wafer.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And then there's a lot of dirt in the air.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
And then there's a lot of radioactivity has also been touching our wafer.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Whether it's sticking or producing.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Whether it's sticking or producing.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
These elements.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So minimize the surface area.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So minimize the surface area.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The total radioactivity of the whole experiment.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
So we want it to be a big piece.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Not a lot of small pieces.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Not a lot of small pieces.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Does this make sense?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Does this make sense?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
But I mean, why is it so thick?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
But I mean, why is it so thick?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
But I mean, why is it so thick?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Because it's very thick.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It means that it's very small on the same quality.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Or we have the same thickness.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Or we have the same total weight.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
We can also use a thin piece of stone.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
But its surface area is very large.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Ah, I see what you mean.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Ah, I see what you mean.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Ah, I see what you mean.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Ah, I see what you mean.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Can I ask a question?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
How do you do calibration for detectors?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
How do you do calibration for detectors?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
How do you do calibration for detectors?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
This is a bit complicated.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Let me talk about this first.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Let me talk about this first.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
This HVEV.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
We actually hit it with a laser.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
We have a fiber.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
We have a fiber.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
We have a fiber.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Because you use a pulse laser.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Because you use a pulse laser.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
We can see this spectrum.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
We can see this spectrum.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
This is calibration.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
This is calibration.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

Okay, let's give one last round of applause to Rayleigh.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Okay, I'll end the recording now.
