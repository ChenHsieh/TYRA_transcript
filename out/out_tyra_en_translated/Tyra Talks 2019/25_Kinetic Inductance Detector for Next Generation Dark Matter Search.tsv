0	10000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's Project Terra talk.
10000	14000	I'm the host today. Just call me Ted.
14000	20000	Today's speaker is Don Yen-Yong from Caltech.
20000	23000	He works at NASA JPL in Caltech.
23000	31000	Today's topic is Connected Inductance Detector for Next-Generation Dark Matter Search.
31000	35000	So, Yen-Yong, it's your turn.
35000	37000	Hi, everyone.
37000	41000	Today's talk is more like an update on the latest situation.
41000	45000	I think I've talked about what I've done a year ago.
45000	49000	Actually, the content is pretty much the same, but there's a new progress.
49000	55000	Some parts of the talk might be fast, and some parts might not be clear.
55000	57000	If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
57000	61000	To be honest, I've been very busy lately, so I've only started this morning.
61000	65000	So if you don't ask questions, it'll be over soon.
65000	67000	Today's topic is connected...
67000	73000	Let me add that when you come in, you don't have a microphone on.
73000	78000	So if you want to ask a question, you have to turn on the microphone.
78000	80000	So you can ask the question and hear it.
80000	87000	At the same time, you can also ask the question in the chat next to you.
87000	89000	Okay, sorry. Yen-Yong, let's get started.
89000	91000	Okay, I have another question.
91000	94000	Can you see my mouse?
94000	96000	Can you see it?
96000	97000	You can see it, right?
97000	101000	Because I might talk about this and that a lot, so I need a mouse.
102000	110000	Okay, so today's topic is Kinetic Inductance Detector for Next Generation Dark Matter Search.
110000	113000	So as you can see, there are two parts to the topic.
113000	119000	One part is that we're thinking about looking for dark matter.
119000	122000	At this stage, we're going to look at future development.
122000	128000	The other part of this talk is that we think we can apply this.
128000	131000	We call it KIT, K-I-T, Kinetic Inductance Detector.
131000	136000	As the next main, we think it's going to be very competitive.
136000	138000	This technology to do this.
138000	143000	Okay, and then this work is mainly from where I am.
143000	146000	Caltech and NASA JPL, which is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
146000	151000	Of course, this whole work is actually based on a bigger project called Super CDMS.
151000	152000	I'll talk about it later.
152000	156000	But I want to emphasize that KIT is not a CDMS project yet.
156000	158000	So it's more like our own R&D.
158000	161000	But we're doing it in a big collaboration.
161000	164000	Okay, so now you see this first page.
164000	167000	The first page is our current prototype.
167000	170000	That gives you a sense of the size.
170000	172000	This circle is 3 inches.
172000	173000	Its diameter is 3 inches.
173000	176000	It's about the same size as a palm.
176000	180000	So now you see this little rectangle.
180000	183000	It's about a half to one millimeter in size.
183000	186000	And then there are 80 little islands on it.
186000	188000	I'll explain what it is.
188000	190000	Okay, and then this box.
190000	197000	It's basically hanging on a dilution refrigerator.
197000	203000	So it can be lowered to the temperature of the mini Kelvin level.
203000	206000	So I'll explain why we're doing this.
206000	210000	Okay, first of all, today's outline is why.
210000	213000	Because we don't have a particle physics background today.
213000	214000	And there seems to be a problem, right?
214000	215000	So I'm going to explain a little bit today.
215000	217000	Why do we think there's dark matter?
217000	219000	What the hell is dark matter?
219000	221000	So I'm going to use an association here.
221000	223000	What's more important is that this is our focus.
223000	228000	Why do we think this low-quality, low-mass dark matter is an important topic now?
228000	229000	So we want to do this.
229000	231000	Okay, this is an opening.
231000	237000	And then I'll talk about the super CDMS detector called HVEV.
237000	239000	HVE is high voltage.
239000	241000	EV is the electron volt.
241000	246000	He's actually talking about what we're doing in a high voltage mode.
246000	249000	Under this operation, we can have EV resolution.
249000	253000	Okay, so I'm going to start by saying that this is a CDMS project.
253000	255000	What did we learn from this?
255000	256000	So what did we get?
256000	258000	So where's our sensitivity?
258000	262000	So from here, I'm going to motivate.
262000	267000	So why the third part, the kinetic inductance detector, this thing.
267000	270000	It's going to be something that we think is very potential.
270000	275000	So now the CDMS proposal is written to 2025.
275000	277000	So we're actually talking about this thing.
277000	279000	Dark matter search beyond 2025.
279000	282000	What kind of outlook do we have?
282000	283000	What do we think?
283000	285000	Okay, let's get started.
285000	287000	Then I welcome you to ask me any questions at any time.
287000	289000	Otherwise, this talk is really going to be pretty fast.
289000	290000	And my speech is actually very fast.
290000	293000	Okay, the first part, low-mass dark matter.
293000	297000	Okay, first of all, I remember two or three weeks ago.
297000	298000	I have a very good friend, He Shuyu.
298000	299000	He talked about a talk.
299000	302000	He's actually doing the theory of dark matter.
302000	304000	So why is there dark matter?
304000	306000	What the hell is dark matter?
306000	308000	I just have this page today.
308000	311000	So if you're interested, you want to know more details.
311000	312000	You can go see his talk.
312000	314000	He's a very good speaker.
314000	315000	He taught very well.
315000	316000	Then I'll summarize here.
316000	319000	This is some evidence that we think there is dark matter.
319000	322000	First of all, you see this picture in the upper left corner.
322000	329000	The y-axis of this picture is the speed of the planet's rotation in the Milky Way.
329000	331000	What about this horizontal axis?
331000	335000	It's the distance between these planets and the center of the Milky Way.
335000	338000	Okay, so now you see that there are dozens of lines here.
338000	339000	And then more than 20 lines.
339000	340000	If we take a few steps.
340000	343000	These lines, each line is a galaxy.
343000	344000	Then you can go to the galaxy.
344000	346000	There are a lot of planets in the galaxy.
346000	348000	The speed of rotation to the center.
348000	350000	And then the distance to the center.
350000	351000	You see a line like this.
351000	353000	It's a galaxy, a galaxy, a galaxy.
353000	356000	According to Newton's law that we learned in high school.
356000	360000	If today we assume that Newton's law is correct.
360000	361000	Or relative theory is correct.
361000	362000	Then we think he's right.
362000	364000	OK, what about this line?
364000	366000	What should it look like?
366000	368000	It should look like this.
368000	370000	It's from the top.
370000	372000	The closer to the center, the faster the rotation.
372000	374000	And then it goes down like this.
374000	377000	And then the closer it is to the outside, the slower it rotates.
377000	378000	OK.
378000	379000	But in fact, what we see is not like this.
379000	380000	In fact, what we see is.
380000	382000	The speed of rotation of these planets.
382000	384000	It's going to pull up from the center.
384000	386000	Of course, it's very close to the center.
386000	387000	We don't understand.
387000	389000	Because there are a lot of planets in the middle.
389000	391000	A lot of electrons and so on.
391000	393000	Then we get rid of the middle.
393000	395000	He saw that it was almost flat.
395000	397000	OK, almost flat.
397000	399000	That means.
399000	400000	Of course, we can say.
400000	401000	Then this may be.
401000	403000	The theory of gravity is incorrect.
403000	404000	This is possible.
404000	407000	But gravity has been experimented by a lot of experiments.
407000	410000	From classical gravity to the theory of gravity.
410000	412000	The theory of gravity has been very, very accurately verified.
412000	414000	So then we can think about it in another way.
414000	415000	Is that?
415000	417000	Hey, we have quality.
417000	419000	It exists in that range.
419000	420000	But we didn't see it.
420000	422000	We can't see these qualities.
422000	423000	So we miscalculated.
423000	425000	But if we add these qualities.
425000	427000	We can recover like this.
427000	429000	This is the center of gravity.
429000	431000	The speed of rotation of this curve.
431000	434000	OK, this is a hint.
434000	436000	That is to say, there may be some matter over there.
436000	437000	We can't see it.
437000	439000	We call it dark matter.
439000	440000	But OK.
440000	441000	So you can imagine this dark matter.
441000	443000	Under this picture.
443000	445000	Like a fluid or a gas.
445000	447000	It's a continuous.
447000	450000	And then it's distributed smoothly in that space.
450000	452000	In the middle of the galaxy.
452000	453000	OK.
453000	455000	But we don't know its particle nature.
455000	457000	That is to say, we can understand.
457000	458000	For example, air or water.
458000	460000	But we can't find that molecule.
460000	461000	That H2O.
461000	462000	OK.
462000	464000	Now in this upper right corner.
464000	466000	What you see is a bigger scale.
466000	467000	This simulation.
467000	469000	You are in this simulation.
469000	471000	Every little light spot you see.
471000	473000	It's all a bunch of galaxies.
473000	474000	It's no longer one by one.
474000	476000	It's a bunch of galaxies.
476000	477000	OK.
477000	479000	Then this picture is actually white.
479000	482000	So you can see the black part.
482000	483000	What about this black part?
483000	485000	That is, if we assume.
485000	487000	There is a gas in this universe.
487000	489000	It's not going to be with other gases.
489000	491000	This is the interaction.
491000	493000	But it has weight.
493000	495000	So it's going to have a denser place.
495000	497000	Because gravity attracts.
497000	499000	And then it's going to form.
499000	501000	Like this spider web structure.
501000	504000	And then these spider web structures are denser.
504000	505000	Gravity is heavier.
505000	507000	It will attract these gases.
507000	508000	These we can see.
508000	509000	These normal.
509000	511000	These substances.
511000	512000	Gather together.
512000	514000	And then form a galaxy.
514000	515000	Then we found out.
515000	517000	We must be in our computer.
517000	518000	In this simulation.
518000	520000	With this kind of content.
520000	522000	We can.
522000	523000	Simulate this.
523000	525000	The evolution of the universe.
525000	527000	And then we produce what we want.
527000	529000	The density of this galaxy.
529000	531000	So we think this is also a proof.
531000	533000	That is, there is a kind of matter that will not interact.
533000	534000	Dark matter.
534000	536000	This is Bully Cluster.
536000	537000	I won't talk about this.
537000	538000	Everyone can go.
538000	539000	This can be googled.
539000	540000	This is a bit complicated.
540000	542000	But basically, he said.
542000	544000	If there are two galaxies colliding today.
544000	546000	We can see the quality inside.
546000	548000	Will hit and will not pass.
548000	549000	The difference in quality.
549000	551000	Then we found out that he had to have a part.
551000	552000	Will not touch.
552000	553000	Passed by.
553000	554000	OK, what about the last one?
554000	556000	This is a very, very accurate evidence.
556000	558000	This is what we see.
558000	560000	The change in temperature in the whole sky.
560000	562000	I call the background color of the universe.
562000	564000	The change in temperature in the whole sky.
564000	566000	And then he changed this.
566000	568000	And then we found out.
568000	570000	If we assume that this change is from.
570000	572000	When the universe was very, very early.
572000	574000	These substances.
574000	576000	This process of gathering together.
576000	580000	The moment of that temperature.
580000	581000	OK.
581000	582000	That.
582000	584000	These condensed substances.
584000	586000	It must have a certain proportion.
586000	587000	Will interact.
587000	589000	A certain proportion will not collide with each other.
589000	591000	That proportion can be very, very accurate.
591000	592000	Fixed.
592000	594000	This is the case.
594000	596000	OK, so we know from here.
596000	597000	Oh, that.
597000	599000	We can calculate very accurately.
599000	601000	In this universe.
601000	604000	20 to 30% will not interact.
604000	605000	Of this substance.
605000	607000	Then about 5% will interact.
607000	609000	What about the rest?
609000	611000	This is another energy content.
611000	612000	Dark energy.
612000	613000	But we won't talk about it today.
613000	615000	So these are the evidence of dark matter.
615000	618000	That's a bit like a science.
618000	621000	Do you have any questions?
621000	623000	If you are interested in any of these.
623000	625000	I can talk a little bit.
625000	627000	Otherwise, we'll go.
627000	629000	What does this angle scale mean?
629000	631000	Why is the angle scale?
631000	632000	Oh, OK.
632000	634000	So this picture is like this.
634000	635000	You can of course.
635000	636000	This thing.
636000	638000	It's the color next to it.
638000	639000	The whole universe.
639000	641000	Just put your temperature on it.
641000	643000	Different temperatures have different colors.
643000	645000	But you can do this today.
645000	647000	A map of the 2D map.
647000	649000	But it's a universe.
649000	650000	So his.
650000	653000	It's a bit like you're doing it.
653000	654000	Frequency spectrum.
654000	656000	But his frequency.
656000	658000	That dimension is the angle.
658000	662000	OK, OK.
662000	663000	Is it OK?
663000	664000	He's doing it.
664000	665000	It will look like this.
666000	669000	OK.
669000	670000	But that.
670000	672000	Because I'm doing particle physics.
672000	674000	So we care more about this thing.
674000	675000	That's what I just said.
675000	677000	There's a group of gas in the universe.
677000	679000	It's not going to work at all.
679000	681000	So if we break it down.
681000	683000	This is the smallest.
683000	685000	This is the constituent.
685000	686000	So what is it?
686000	688000	Elementary particle?
688000	690000	It can be one by one.
690000	691000	Very, very heavy.
691000	693000	But his number is very small.
693000	694000	Or he can be one by one.
694000	695000	Very light.
695000	696000	But he's very, very many.
696000	699000	So in the same volume.
699000	701000	It's produced in that cube.
701000	702000	The quality inside is the same.
702000	704000	It's in line with what we just did.
704000	706000	The observation of these big gases.
706000	708000	I got the density of this quality.
708000	710000	Okay, but he's in the particle nature.
710000	711000	It's going to be very different.
711000	714000	Now, what you see here.
714000	716000	OK, this is.
716000	718000	This is.
718000	719000	This quality unit.
719000	721000	So if you're in this background.
721000	722000	You don't have to explain to me.
722000	723000	What is EV?
723000	726000	If you don't know this.
726000	728000	What unit is this EV?
728000	730000	I'll give you a sense.
730000	733000	From this K to M.
733000	734000	Sorry.
734000	736000	From this K to M, this neighborhood.
736000	738000	It's the X-ray that you usually take.
738000	739000	OK.
739000	740000	If you're in this.
740000	741000	This is not.
741000	742000	This is just the unit.
742000	743000	EV this range.
743000	745000	It's visible light.
745000	746000	Energy and quality can be exchanged.
746000	748000	So the strength of this energy.
748000	749000	This is visible light.
749000	750000	This is X-ray.
750000	752000	And then this is very, very powerful.
752000	753000	And then this is here.
753000	755000	It's very, very light.
755000	757000	It's like coming here.
757000	758000	It might be the usual.
758000	759000	The radio wave on the phone.
759000	760000	And then go further.
760000	761000	It's very, very light.
761000	763000	Light to the particle.
763000	766000	The length of the material wave can be long.
766000	768000	This kind of astronomical scale.
768000	769000	OK.
769000	771000	Okay, so this is.
771000	772000	This mass.
772000	775000	OK, this dark matter candidate mass.
775000	776000	And then what's below?
776000	778000	It's all kinds of us now.
779000	780000	This theory.
780000	782000	And then you can see that this is almost.
782000	784000	You can go to the sky and say whatever you want.
784000	786000	It's the heaviest you can get.
786000	788000	This is the unit of solar mass.
788000	790000	He can't use this EV anymore.
790000	792000	But if we cut this part out and look at it.
792000	794000	From here to the other end.
794000	797000	It's dozens of orders of magnitude.
797000	798000	OK.
798000	799000	We don't know this thing at all.
799000	801000	Basically, we don't know this thing at all.
801000	802000	What is it?
802000	803000	OK.
803000	804000	Good.
804000	807000	So here's a lot of this model.
807000	808000	That.
808000	812000	Uh, now I'm going to draw this orange frame.
812000	814000	OK, this frame.
814000	817000	Sorry.
817000	819000	It can be said that in the past 30 or 40 years.
819000	822000	All I want to know is the particle.
822000	825000	The experiment of dark matter is focused on this frame.
825000	828000	There's a reason for this frame.
828000	830000	The top line of this frame.
830000	833000	There's a theoretical top line called Unitary Bond.
833000	836000	If this single particle of this dark matter.
836000	839000	If it's heavier than this one up here.
839000	844000	He will, uh, have this mathematical theoretical problem.
844000	846000	That is to say, it will exceed Unitary.
846000	848000	I don't know why, but OK.
848000	850000	So, in theory, we can say that he won't go beyond this.
850000	852000	Unless he looks really weird.
852000	854000	For example, he is a black hole or something.
854000	856000	This thing is going to be astronomical observation.
856000	859000	That's what we're not going to talk about on the single particle.
859000	861000	OK, what's next?
861000	864000	You can see that this is a very clear picture here.
864000	869000	What does it mean?
869000	872000	It's his interaction, or his own quality.
872000	874000	Or the energy he can carry.
874000	876000	It's probably in this weak interaction.
876000	878000	The energy scale of this interaction.
878000	880000	He has a very strong reason.
880000	882000	I'll talk about it later.
882000	884000	But you can see that the more important thing is.
884000	886000	So all the design of the experiment.
886000	888000	Including, uh, in the collision machine.
888000	891000	Whether it's a Japanese collision machine, a European collision machine.
891000	893000	China may build a collision machine in the future.
893000	896000	Everyone is basically aiming at this orange box.
896000	898000	Find Dark Matter inside.
898000	901000	What about all the experiments that don't do this collider?
901000	906000	Basically, now the major experiments are also in this box.
906000	908000	OK, but you can see it right away.
908000	910000	There are 30 orders of magnitude here.
910000	915000	It's only less than one-tenth.
915000	922000	OK, so why do they aim at this box?
922000	924000	Let's talk about it first.
924000	926000	What kind of technology is this limit?
926000	928000	Or what kind of technology are they based on?
928000	931000	They will focus on this box.
931000	934000	In fact, the concept of measuring Dark Matter is very simple.
934000	936000	It's like hitting a ball.
936000	938000	OK, this is the earth.
938000	939000	Then this is us.
939000	942000	Then we took some of the materials that people can manipulate.
942000	944000	To do any of our experimental equipment.
944000	949000	Then these equipment are nothing more than a bunch of seeds and seeds.
949000	952000	Here is a seed or seed.
952000	955000	The earth is in the solar system.
955000	957000	The solar system is in the galactic system.
957000	959000	Then the galactic system is full of what I just said.
959000	963000	The gas of Dark Matter is drifting in the entire galactic system.
963000	967000	So when our solar system revolves around the center of the galactic system.
967000	972000	We are constantly like being blown by the wind of Dark Matter.
972000	976000	OK, so at this time, if we take this seed and seed.
976000	979000	To build an experiment on the earth.
979000	982000	Dark Matter will keep going through.
982000	984000	We think it's very, very small.
984000	986000	Of course, we haven't measured it yet.
986000	989000	But it is likely to exist.
989000	991000	It won't just go through.
991000	994000	It will hit our experiment and then bounce away.
994000	998000	At this time, there will be some of this dynamic being picked up.
998000	1000000	On this seed or seed.
1000000	1002000	Then we will measure this seed or seed.
1002000	1005000	We can know how heavy it is.
1005000	1006000	Hit down.
1006000	1008000	It will pick up such a large amount of energy.
1008000	1010000	We call it Recall Energy.
1010000	1014000	OK, let's bring all the numbers in.
1014000	1016000	We probably know that.
1016000	1018000	Dark Matter to choose.
1018000	1020000	How fast we blow the wind of Dark Matter.
1020000	1024000	OK, so we know how heavy the seed or seed is.
1024000	1027000	Then we can be different.
1027000	1029000	This hypothetical Dark Matter Mass.
1029000	1032000	To calculate how much energy we can pick up.
1033000	1036000	We pick up this recall energy.
1036000	1039000	The most efficient scenario is exactly the same as hitting the ball.
1039000	1041000	If there is a very heavy thing today.
1041000	1042000	Hit a very light thing.
1042000	1043000	Or a very light thing.
1043000	1045000	Hit a very heavy thing.
1045000	1047000	The speed of the two people is almost unchanged.
1047000	1049000	So this will not pick up energy.
1049000	1050000	But the most efficient time.
1050000	1051000	It's the thing that comes across.
1051000	1052000	With the thing that is hit.
1052000	1054000	The two of them are almost just right.
1054000	1055000	So let's estimate that.
1055000	1057000	OK, if we assume now.
1057000	1058000	Hit Dark Matter.
1058000	1060000	The quality of this particle.
1060000	1061000	Exactly.
1061000	1064000	It's with us to do this experiment.
1064000	1066000	The seed is just as heavy.
1066000	1068000	What about the energy that he transferred?
1068000	1071000	It's probably an X-ray energy.
1071000	1073000	So if we can build an experiment today.
1073000	1075000	We can measure X-ray.
1075000	1076000	This energy.
1076000	1079000	We can probably measure this kind of Dark Matter.
1079000	1081000	What's the problem here?
1081000	1082000	This is high school physics.
1086000	1088000	Okay, no problem, I'll go on.
1089000	1092000	Then you assume the weight of the dark matter.
1092000	1095000	Because all of your detectors are magnets.
1095000	1097000	It's similar.
1097000	1099000	Isn't that like this?
1099000	1101000	You have a predicted dark matter.
1101000	1103000	It's about the same weight as a magnet.
1105000	1107000	Okay, this is a very good question.
1107000	1108000	I'll talk about it later.
1108000	1109000	You can imagine.
1109000	1111000	So if Dark Matter today.
1111000	1112000	It's a super-heavy thing.
1112000	1114000	Or a super-light thing.
1114000	1115000	I say relatively compared to.
1115000	1117000	For example, Proton.
1117000	1119000	It's a super-heavy or super-light thing.
1119000	1120000	It hits.
1120000	1122000	Your experiment doesn't actually pick up any energy.
1122000	1124000	Right?
1124000	1126000	Yeah, or it's super light.
1126000	1127000	Yeah, he's gone.
1127000	1128000	Yeah, that's right.
1128000	1130000	That's what it is.
1130000	1131000	So you can say.
1131000	1133000	Use an order of magnitude estimate.
1133000	1134000	Just say OK.
1134000	1136000	So you use this kind of target particle.
1136000	1138000	Basically.
1138000	1139000	You set yourself up first.
1139000	1141000	It's probably in this order of magnitude.
1141000	1145000	To measure the weight of this particle.
1145000	1147000	If it's heavy or light, you won't be able to measure it.
1147000	1150000	Because the energy transfer will become small.
1150000	1151000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1151000	1152000	Right?
1152000	1153000	All right, yeah, all right.
1153000	1156000	Okay, let's go back to the other side.
1156000	1160000	Well, in general, if you go to a dark matter meeting.
1160000	1162000	This is what people usually see.
1162000	1163000	What is this picture?
1163000	1164000	This picture is.
1164000	1167000	This is the imaginary.
1167000	1170000	Dark Matter Mass.
1171000	1178000	From here is the 10 to the negative 5 times of the GV to the 10 to the 3 times of the GV.
1178000	1180000	Uh, okay.
1180000	1183000	Okay, so what about these 10 lines?
1183000	1185000	It's an already completed experiment.
1185000	1186000	Sorry.
1186000	1188000	What about these long lines?
1188000	1190000	It's about to be released.
1190000	1193000	Uh, the results of the experiment that will be released in a few years.
1193000	1195000	Okay, what about those dots?
1195000	1197000	It's something like conceptual design.
1197000	1200000	Or something like, uh.
1200000	1202000	Calculate it out and say I project.
1202000	1205000	If I have completed this concept, where can I go?
1205000	1207000	It's not so realistic.
1207000	1210000	Okay, so I'm going to draw a line here.
1210000	1213000	It means that I'm done with this experiment and I'm going to put it all back on top.
1213000	1215000	Okay, what does that mean?
1215000	1216000	It means.
1216000	1219000	I open my experiment and then I keep waiting and waiting and waiting.
1219000	1220000	I know how long I've been waiting.
1220000	1222000	I know how heavy my experiment is.
1222000	1226000	Therefore, I know how many protons or neutrons I have waiting there.
1226000	1227000	Wait for a long time.
1227000	1228000	I didn't wait for anything.
1228000	1230000	So I can say.
1230000	1232000	How big is it according to my experiment?
1232000	1233000	How long have I been waiting?
1233000	1235000	And then I didn't see anything.
1235000	1238000	I can say with enough confidence.
1238000	1240000	Dark matter passes through me.
1240000	1242000	The probability of being blocked.
1242000	1244000	It's not going to be more than a number.
1244000	1246000	Otherwise, I should see something.
1246000	1248000	This sentence is a bit long.
1248000	1249000	Can you understand?
1249000	1251000	Okay, so based on.
1251000	1254000	I didn't see any results of the experiment.
1255000	1257000	But I know very clearly.
1257000	1258000	How long have I been waiting?
1258000	1260000	How many things did I use to block?
1260000	1261000	Can't block.
1261000	1263000	So I can say.
1263000	1265000	Dark matter and protons and neutrons.
1265000	1268000	The probability of interaction will not exceed a number.
1268000	1269000	Then I can.
1269000	1271000	For each different assumption.
1271000	1272000	The quality of dark matter.
1272000	1273000	To calculate a number.
1273000	1275000	So in the end, it's a line.
1275000	1276000	Then I'll empty it out here.
1276000	1277000	Draw it black.
1277000	1278000	That is to say.
1278000	1279000	Okay, dark matter.
1279000	1280000	The interaction.
1280000	1281000	If today is.
1281000	1282000	If it's EEV.
1282000	1284000	It's definitely not.
1284000	1286000	The interaction is 10 to 40.
1286000	1287000	Must be smaller.
1287000	1288000	If it's bigger.
1288000	1290000	I should see it.
1290000	1291000	OK.
1291000	1293000	So these lines are what it means.
1293000	1294000	So you can see.
1294000	1295000	The current limit is.
1295000	1297000	This way.
1297000	1298000	That is to say.
1298000	1299000	We have to keep going down.
1299000	1300000	Keep digging down.
1300000	1301000	Until one day we see.
1301000	1302000	Dark matter really.
1302000	1304000	Always in the detector.
1304000	1305000	it is good.
1305000	1306000	Then.
1306000	1308000	Go back to the question that Ted just asked.
1308000	1310000	Now all the experiments here.
1310000	1311000	There is sensitivity.
1311000	1312000	You can measure.
1312000	1313000	You can set a limit.
1313000	1314000	Constraint like this.
1314000	1316000	But it's probably around here.
1316000	1318000	It's all gone.
1318000	1320000	And then there's almost no way to measure it any lower.
1320000	1321000	Why?
1321000	1323000	Because all of these experiments.
1323000	1325000	It's all paper and seeds.
1325000	1326000	To block dark matter.
1326000	1328000	So for these.
1328000	1330000	Lighter possible dark matter.
1330000	1332000	When it hits.
1332000	1334000	The remaining energy is very small.
1334000	1335000	In these experiments.
1335000	1336000	It can't be measured.
1336000	1337000	OK, I can't measure it.
1337000	1338000	Then I can't say.
1338000	1340000	What should I do here?
1340000	1341000	So there's a threshold here.
1341000	1342000	Further down.
1342000	1344000	We can't measure dark matter.
1344000	1345000	This is the first point.
1345000	1347000	The second point.
1347000	1349000	There's a yellow one down here.
1349000	1350000	A very large piece of stuff.
1350000	1351000	What is this?
1351000	1352000	This is a constant.
1352000	1355000	The seeds of the earth.
1355000	1357000	Now all the experimental design.
1357000	1359000	Basically, there is no clear.
1359000	1360000	The way is to say.
1360000	1361000	I can be very efficient.
1361000	1363000	Distinguish between dark matter and seeds.
1363000	1367000	The difference in this signal.
1367000	1368000	So if I keep digging today.
1368000	1369000	I keep going down.
1369000	1370000	Keep drawing.
1370000	1372000	It's about this long.
1372000	1373000	Here.
1373000	1374000	If I keep drawing here.
1374000	1375000	Dig it out.
1375000	1377000	I still don't see the dark matter.
1377000	1379000	Next, I'll go crazy.
1379000	1380000	There's always a signal.
1380000	1381000	But I probably will.
1381000	1382000	We all think.
1382000	1383000	Oh, that should be the sun.
1383000	1384000	It's coming out.
1384000	1386000	Or the radioactivity of the earth.
1386000	1387000	Out of the seeds.
1387000	1388000	We can't do it again.
1388000	1390000	Continue to measure this part.
1390000	1392000	At least in the foreseeable future.
1392000	1394000	No technology can do this.
1394000	1395000	OK.
1395000	1398000	Why are these experiments still so focused?
1398000	1399000	Dig this part.
1399000	1402000	For example, from 10GbE to 50EbE.
1402000	1404000	That's the reason.
1404000	1406000	Now I'm going to draw these models.
1406000	1408000	You can see it.
1408000	1409000	It's full of models here.
1409000	1410000	That's what I just said.
1410000	1413000	It can even extend to 10 to 30.
1413000	1414000	No problem.
1414000	1417000	But all of this.
1417000	1420000	What you can dig here is MSSM.
1420000	1422000	This is called super symmetry theory.
1423000	1426000	Between the 1980s and 2000s.
1426000	1429000	Everyone is very confident about super symmetry theory.
1429000	1431000	I think it might be.
1431000	1436000	It's a very important theory.
1436000	1439000	It also provides a variety of variations.
1439000	1441000	It depends on what kind of super symmetry theory you are.
1441000	1443000	The dark matter candidate.
1443000	1444000	So everyone is confident.
1444000	1445000	But keep digging.
1445000	1448000	But in fact, the earliest version of super symmetry theory.
1448000	1451000	In fact, its prediction should be around 10 to 38.
1452000	1453000	It's already been dug up.
1453000	1458000	And be ruled out by more than 10 orders of magnitude.
1458000	1459000	So much.
1459000	1462000	OK, so now we see this P or C or N.
1462000	1464000	What about this super symmetry theory?
1464000	1467000	It's all very fine-tuned.
1467000	1472000	OK, so now we generally think.
1472000	1473000	OK.
1473000	1475000	Within 5 to 10 years.
1475000	1477000	These experiments will be completed.
1477000	1480000	The dotted line they draw.
1480000	1482000	Unless we are either in this range.
1482000	1484000	We found the document.
1484000	1487000	Otherwise, these experiments are based on technology.
1487000	1489000	There will probably be a lot of difficulty.
1489000	1490000	Extend down.
1490000	1491000	Because it will meet neutrino.
1491000	1492000	This is the first point.
1492000	1493000	The second point is.
1493000	1496000	In fact, if you are.
1496000	1499000	It's a theory that needs to be very natural.
1499000	1501000	Not very artificially.
1501000	1503000	To find a very difficult to produce.
1503000	1505000	The combination of parameters.
1505000	1507000	In fact, those natural.
1508000	1510000	Theoretical prediction.
1510000	1511000	It's already been dug up.
1511000	1512000	OK.
1512000	1514000	But back to this point.
1514000	1517000	In fact, there are still a lot of models down here.
1517000	1518000	OK.
1518000	1520000	So we want to do.
1520000	1522000	Uh.
1522000	1525000	We want to find better technology.
1525000	1527000	In addition to digging here.
1527000	1530000	We want to be able to cover the remaining dozens.
1530000	1532000	This order of magnitude is not measured at all.
1532000	1536000	Or it's hard to measure.
1536000	1537000	OK.
1537000	1538000	So what are we going to do?
1538000	1540000	I just said.
1540000	1542000	We want to block a very light particle.
1542000	1544000	We can't use a very heavy magnet or seed to block it.
1544000	1545000	Because of this.
1545000	1547000	This energy will be very little.
1547000	1549000	So that's another thing that humans can control.
1549000	1551000	In addition to the magnet and the seed is the electron.
1551000	1553000	In fact, there is not much else.
1553000	1554000	OK.
1554000	1555000	Then I change it to an electron now.
1555000	1556000	OK.
1556000	1557000	Then I bring the number in.
1557000	1560000	The electron is instantly 100 times lighter than the magnet and the seed.
1560000	1561000	No, sorry.
1561000	1562000	1,000 times.
1562000	1563000	2,000 times.
1563000	1564000	Almost 2,000 times.
1565000	1567000	To a very, very light quality.
1567000	1569000	So now I can block it.
1569000	1571000	The energy consumed is probably.
1571000	1574000	I can be sensitive to 100EV.
1574000	1575000	That's dozens of EV.
1575000	1577000	Let's talk about dozens of EV.
1577000	1579000	But if you use a magnet.
1579000	1582000	It's hundreds of EVs that can be measured.
1582000	1584000	That is to say, if I want to eat more.
1584000	1586000	Eat this light particle more efficiently.
1586000	1587000	Give me the energy.
1587000	1589000	I have to use light things to block.
1589000	1591000	So our idea now is.
1591000	1594000	Electron as the target of being hit.
1594000	1596000	OK.
1596000	1598000	Okay, because he's an electron.
1598000	1600000	So he actually has another interaction.
1600000	1603000	He will directly put the light.
1603000	1605000	Light is the electromagnetic wave.
1605000	1607000	So if there is a model today.
1607000	1608000	Is.
1608000	1610000	Will convert to light or light.
1610000	1612000	He will absorb it all.
1612000	1614000	At this time, it is not the opposite.
1614000	1616000	And then eat some of the energy.
1616000	1618000	But we will put all this energy.
1618000	1620000	Just like his quality, so much energy.
1620000	1622000	The quality will become his energy.
1622000	1623000	Eat it all.
1623000	1624000	Then we can also measure this.
1624000	1626000	If you use electrons.
1626000	1627000	OK.
1627000	1629000	So we are now.
1629000	1631000	I think we should use electrons.
1631000	1633000	To replace the straight and neutral.
1633000	1635000	To produce for lighter particles.
1635000	1636000	This sensitivity.
1636000	1638000	Then we will.
1638000	1640000	It's a definition of this talk.
1640000	1642000	That is to say, we will talk about low mass later.
1642000	1644000	Low mass is probably GEV.
1644000	1645000	Or lighter particles.
1645000	1647000	Then emphasize it again.
1647000	1648000	There are so many here.
1649000	1651000	For example, dark sector.
1651000	1653000	This is the metric.
1653000	1655000	Freezing, etc.
1655000	1656000	OK.
1656000	1658000	Of course, there are.
1658000	1659000	Uh.
1659000	1661000	We are still experimenting with this.
1661000	1663000	I just talked about this.
1663000	1665000	The mechanism of hitting the ball.
1665000	1666000	But in fact.
1666000	1668000	For example, like the theory.
1668000	1670000	Uh, he predicted that.
1670000	1672000	There will be very natural.
1672000	1673000	Can produce this.
1673000	1675000	It's not a particle at all.
1675000	1676000	It's more like a bunch of.
1677000	1679000	That's like this.
1679000	1681000	We can actually measure it.
1681000	1683000	But of course we have to assume that.
1683000	1685000	Assuming he's going to do this.
1685000	1687000	This kind of behavior.
1687000	1689000	Then we can use this method to measure.
1689000	1691000	So in other words, we can.
1691000	1693000	If there is such a behavior.
1693000	1695000	What is his probability?
1695000	1696000	That's for me.
1696000	1698000	Uh, like we do experiments.
1698000	1699000	A more important point is.
1699000	1701000	How do we really.
1701000	1703000	To do such an experiment realistically.
1703000	1704000	Like I just said.
1704000	1706000	We want to maximize this.
1706000	1707000	Momentum energy transfer.
1707000	1708000	So we have to be very light.
1708000	1710000	This target the particle.
1710000	1712000	Of course, we want very small, very small noise.
1712000	1714000	OK, because of this.
1714000	1716000	We can only see a very small signal.
1716000	1718000	So there will be enough.
1718000	1719000	Signal to noise ratio.
1719000	1720000	OK.
1720000	1721000	Back to just now.
1721000	1723000	We want the sensitivity of sub-Kev.
1723000	1724000	OK.
1724000	1725000	It takes a few tens of EVs.
1725000	1726000	Probably below.
1726000	1727000	Then do this.
1727000	1729000	GEV or lighter particle.
1729000	1731000	To see things.
1732000	1733000	OK.
1733000	1735000	Of course, there is also a very important thing.
1735000	1737000	We must be able to know very clearly.
1737000	1739000	The signal I see now.
1739000	1741000	It's from the Dark Matter hit me.
1741000	1743000	Instead of inexplicably.
1743000	1745000	Things in the environment hit my detector.
1745000	1747000	But if the energy is very high today.
1747000	1749000	This thing is relatively easy.
1749000	1751000	Because of this kind of energy in the environment.
1751000	1753000	This kind of radioactivity.
1753000	1754000	In fact, relatively few.
1754000	1755000	Otherwise, in fact, people are dead.
1755000	1757000	OK, but if you reduce the energy to very low.
1757000	1759000	In fact, you are next to the phone.
1760000	1761000	Cell phone signal.
1761000	1763000	It looks like that energy.
1763000	1765000	If you put it in an experimental environment.
1765000	1767000	The temperature of the experimental environment.
1767000	1769000	Black radiation.
1769000	1771000	That light is also this energy.
1771000	1773000	So it started to become very, very much.
1773000	1774000	Low-energy particle.
1774000	1776000	Keep hitting the detector.
1776000	1777000	We need to be able to distinguish.
1777000	1779000	That's the only way to do this.
1779000	1783000	So in fact, it is relatively challenging.
1783000	1784000	OK.
1784000	1786000	I won't talk about this picture.
1786000	1788000	This picture is actually the thing.
1788000	1789000	Ok.
1789000	1790000	Ok, I'm done.
1790000	1792000	The first part is our motivation.
1792000	1793000	Do you have any questions?
1799000	1800000	Hello.
1800000	1802000	Do you hear me?
1802000	1804000	Yes, yes, yes.
1804000	1805000	Then I want to.
1805000	1807000	I'm the one who does Neoscience.
1807000	1809000	So I don't have a background.
1809000	1811000	But I want to ask.
1811000	1814000	That's how everyone is.
1814000	1815000	Is it that?
1815000	1816000	Neutrino.
1816000	1817000	Oh.
1817000	1819000	How do you do it?
1819000	1820000	Is it?
1820000	1821000	Is it?
1821000	1822000	Neutrino.
1822000	1823000	This question.
1823000	1824000	Is it?
1824000	1825000	OK.
1825000	1826000	You say.
1826000	1827000	What if it's Neutrino?
1827000	1828000	How do you do it?
1828000	1829000	Because the sun will emit a lot.
1829000	1830000	That's right.
1830000	1831000	This question can actually be divided into two.
1831000	1832000	The first one is.
1832000	1833000	I'm not sure.
1833000	1834000	What you want to ask is.
1834000	1835000	How do we know?
1835000	1836000	Neutrino can't be a dark matter.
1836000	1837000	How do we know?
1837000	1838000	How do we know?
1838000	1839000	How do we know?
1839000	1840000	How do we know?
1840000	1841000	How do we know?
1841000	1842000	How do we know?
1843000	1844000	How do we know?
1844000	1845000	Neutrino can't be a dark matter?
1845000	1846000	It's still our detector.
1846000	1847000	What about the signal you see is not Neutrino?
1847000	1848000	How do you know?
1848000	1849000	It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.
1849000	1850000	It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.
1850000	1851000	It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.
1851000	1852000	If you have to first exclude.
1852000	1853000	If you have to first exclude.
1853000	1854000	Is it possible that Neutrino is not?
1854000	1855000	And then do this experiment near the Earth to make it feasible?
1855000	1856000	Because the sun if it is.
1856000	1857000	The sun is not a very strong interferer.
1857000	1858000	That's right.
1858000	1859000	That's right.
1859000	1860000	Okay.
1860000	1861000	The first point.
1861000	1862000	We can use the solar system.
1862000	1863000	The solar system.
1872000	1879000	Why is it called Neutrino now?
1879000	1882000	This is that.
1882000	1885000	Neutrino's distribution is not the same, is it?
1885000	1888000	But why is Neutrino's distribution the same in all three cases?
1888000	1889000	It's because of the black matter in it.
1889000	1890000	Black matter is functional.
1890000	1891000	There's no our detector has the data.
1891000	1892000	You are now with us.
1892000	1893000	More swing neutrino.
1893000	1894000	Neutrino does not form, and now it's coming.
1894000	1895000	Linking together.
1895000	1896000	Really?
1896000	1900000	Then let's talk about the dark matter.
1901000	1903000	It takes a long, long time.
1903000	1906000	It will slowly gather into what we want now.
1906000	1909000	The density of the spider web I just showed.
1909000	1912000	Then attract other particles in.
1912000	1915000	That time is far more than we know.
1915000	1917000	The age of the universe so far.
1917000	1919000	Then the amount of planets produced.
1919000	1922000	So we know that such a light particle.
1922000	1924000	Then its interaction is like Neutrino.
1924000	1928000	Because we actually know a lot about Neutrino.
1928000	1929000	But it's a good feeling.
1929000	1930000	But that is to say.
1930000	1933000	We know the strength of its interaction.
1933000	1935000	So we know.
1935000	1939000	It can't be the dark matter we want.
1939000	1942000	OK, unless there's another version of Neutrino.
1942000	1943000	That's not.
1943000	1944000	That's also new physics.
1944000	1946000	So we know Neutrino.
1946000	1948000	The first is not to do dark matter.
1948000	1949000	The second is if today.
1949000	1950000	OK, then the sun will still shoot.
1950000	1952000	We know that kind of Neutrino.
1952000	1953000	How do we know?
1953000	1957000	The signal we see is not Neutrino.
1957000	1959000	The answer is we don't know.
1959000	1960000	But we know one thing.
1960000	1961000	We know how hot the sun is.
1961000	1963000	We know how much light it emits.
1963000	1965000	We also know almost.
1965000	1967000	The principle of emitting this light is.
1967000	1968000	Which few.
1968000	1971000	The chain of fusion reactions.
1971000	1972000	So we know.
1972000	1974000	Based on its brightness, its heat.
1974000	1975000	Look at these fusion reactions.
1975000	1978000	It emits the flux of Neutrino.
1978000	1980000	How much should that flow be?
1980000	1982000	Plus we know.
1982000	1985000	This kind of Neutrino through our detector.
1985000	1987000	What is the probability of being blocked?
1987000	1989000	OK, so we know.
1989000	1992000	Now the detector sees.
1992000	1994000	It won't be.
1994000	1996000	It won't be Neutrino.
1996000	1998000	Because in theory, in the whole experiment.
1998000	2000000	The duration will be blocked.
2000000	2002000	Maybe it's a few zeros.
2002000	2005000	In other words, it won't be blocked.
2005000	2007000	So we know there's no problem.
2007000	2008000	But based on what I just said.
2008000	2009000	I know how hot the sun is.
2009000	2012000	So how many Neutrino have been through the earth.
2012000	2013000	Through our experiment.
2013000	2015000	When our experiment is getting more and more sensitive.
2015000	2017000	Can be sensitive to.
2017000	2019000	It's worth 47, 48.
2019000	2020000	For example, here.
2020000	2022000	48, 49.
2022000	2024000	At this time, we will be very sensitive.
2024000	2026000	To be able to see that kind of Neutrino.
2026000	2028000	At this time, we see any signal.
2028000	2030000	We can't say.
2030000	2032000	It is Dark Matter or Neutrino.
2032000	2034000	So here to dig this yellow line.
2034000	2036000	This is what I said.
2036000	2037000	The experiment will stop here.
2037000	2039000	Because we basically don't have it now.
2039000	2041000	Reliable technology can tell.
2041000	2043000	Is it Neutrino or Dark Matter?
2045000	2046000	OK.
2046000	2047000	Thank you.
2047000	2049000	But in fact, there is a potential way.
2049000	2051000	If I can distinguish its direction.
2051000	2052000	They all come from the sun.
2052000	2053000	Then I will say that people from the sun.
2053000	2054000	The probability of Neutrino is very high.
2054000	2056000	I don't look over there.
2056000	2057000	OK.
2057000	2059000	But what I'm talking about now is.
2059000	2061000	When this particle hits.
2061000	2062000	The energy it leaves.
2062000	2063000	We only measure energy.
2063000	2064000	We didn't measure.
2064000	2066000	The direction of this incoming particle.
2066000	2067000	So in fact.
2067000	2068000	Unless I can identify this thing.
2068000	2070000	Otherwise, I can't tell Neutrino.
2070000	2071000	The answer is no.
2072000	2073000	OK.
2074000	2075000	Excuse me.
2075000	2076000	Can I ask another question?
2076000	2077000	Please say.
2077000	2078000	Just.
2079000	2081000	Because I don't understand this at all.
2081000	2082000	That.
2083000	2085000	That is, the particle accelerator can.
2085000	2086000	Can.
2086000	2087000	Can.
2087000	2089000	Think of a way to find these heavy particles.
2089000	2091000	Heavy quality particles.
2091000	2092000	That.
2092000	2093000	But for example.
2093000	2095000	Very light particles.
2095000	2097000	Is there no way to find it with an accelerator?
2097000	2098000	So.
2098000	2099000	You are looking for Dark Matter.
2099000	2100000	Assuming this.
2100000	2101000	This.
2102000	2103000	There is a very light particle.
2103000	2105000	Then it could also be Dark Matter.
2105000	2106000	You may.
2106000	2107000	You are looking for Dark Matter.
2107000	2108000	It may also be.
2108000	2109000	Solve this.
2109000	2111000	For example, find a particularly light particle.
2111000	2112000	Then.
2112000	2113000	Maybe the theory can't be predicted.
2113000	2114000	Or.
2114000	2115000	Some theories have been predicted.
2115000	2116000	That's it.
2116000	2117000	But I don't know.
2117000	2118000	Yes.
2118000	2120000	So in fact, the accelerator can find Dark Matter.
2120000	2123000	And a lot of people are looking for Dark Matter in the accelerator.
2123000	2124000	But.
2124000	2126000	Looking for Dark Matter in the accelerator.
2126000	2127000	Like you said.
2127000	2128000	In fact, basically.
2128000	2129000	The concept is completely different.
2129000	2130000	It is.
2130000	2131000	You use your known example.
2131000	2132000	Think of a way.
2132000	2133000	Create Dark Matter.
2133000	2134000	Right.
2134000	2135000	But.
2135000	2137000	It has a very, very practical reason.
2137000	2139000	It's very difficult to do in the accelerator.
2139000	2140000	That is.
2140000	2142000	You take two examples you already know.
2142000	2143000	Put it together.
2143000	2144000	Explode.
2144000	2146000	In addition to producing a Dark Matter.
2146000	2149000	It will produce a lot of other examples.
2149000	2150000	In other words.
2150000	2151000	Your.
2151000	2152000	Next to these.
2152000	2154000	After measuring these explosions.
2154000	2155000	These products.
2155000	2156000	These detectors.
2156000	2157000	It's like being constantly.
2157000	2158000	It's like being constantly.
2158000	2159000	It's like being constantly.
2159000	2160000	It's like being constantly.
2160000	2161000	It has a certain amount of brightness.
2161000	2162000	As long as you do it.
2162000	2163000	It will produce a lot of this.
2163000	2164000	This kind of showering.
2164000	2165000	This kind of background.
2165000	2166000	That.
2166000	2168000	You basically can't see it.
2168000	2170000	If you want to see something.
2170000	2172000	It's smaller than the background of this shower.
2172000	2174000	Because what you see is bright.
2174000	2175000	So.
2175000	2177000	Because of the mechanism of the confrontation.
2177000	2180000	Their lower threshold is probably hundreds of GV.
2180000	2181000	It's probably here.
2181000	2182000	So.
2182000	2183000	It's probably the accelerator.
2183000	2184000	Probably the best.
2185000	2186000	Is.
2186000	2187000	From here.
2187000	2188000	Above.
2188000	2189000	They can say with confidence.
2189000	2190000	If I see something.
2190000	2191000	It's Dark Matter.
2191000	2192000	But they didn't see it either.
2192000	2193000	So they're also drawing a line.
2193000	2194000	But down here.
2194000	2195000	They can't have that confidence.
2195000	2196000	They can't have that confidence.
2196000	2197000	Say I didn't see it.
2197000	2198000	Because their environment is too bright.
2198000	2199000	No, it's too big.
2199000	2200000	But that's right.
2200000	2201000	You can find it in the accelerator.
2201000	2202000	Ok.
2202000	2203000	Ok.
2203000	2204000	Ok.
2204000	2205000	Ok.
2205000	2206000	Ok.
2206000	2207000	Ok.
2207000	2208000	Ok.
2208000	2209000	Ok.
2209000	2210000	Ok.
2210000	2211000	Ok.
2211000	2212000	Ok.
2212000	2213000	Ok.
2213000	2214000	Ok.
2214000	2215000	Is there a problem?
2215000	2216000	Is there a problem?
2216000	2217000	So.
2217000	2218000	So.
2218000	2219000	My question is.
2219000	2220000	That.
2220000	2221000	Uh.
2221000	2222000	I mean.
2222000	2223000	That is to say.
2223000	2224000	Standard model.
2224000	2225000	Also.
2225000	2226000	Also.
2226000	2227000	That is to say.
2227000	2228000	Assuming there is a lighter example.
2228000	2229000	That.
2229000	2230000	Uh-huh.
2230000	2231000	Not only in the accelerator.
2231000	2232000	I can't see it.
2232000	2233000	That standard model.
2233000	2234000	I didn't predict it either.
2234000	2235000	But again.
2235000	2236000	That's right.
2236000	2237000	In fact.
2237000	2238000	There is.
2238000	2239000	Uh.
2239000	2240000	There is a high possibility of Dark Matter.
2240000	2241000	That's it.
2241000	2242000	So.
2242000	2243000	Uh.
2243000	2244000	So.
2244000	2245000	You are looking for Dark Matter.
2245000	2246000	If you find a lighter model.
2246000	2247000	Standard model.
2247000	2248000	I can't predict it.
2248000	2249000	That.
2249000	2250000	Of course.
2250000	2251000	It's a new.
2251000	2252000	New.
2252000	2253000	New.
2253000	2254000	New.
2254000	2255000	Physics.
2255000	2256000	Is that right?
2256000	2257000	Correct.
2257000	2258000	As long as we see Dark Matter.
2258000	2259000	It must be new physics.
2259000	2260000	Ok.
2260000	2261000	Because Dark Matter itself.
2261000	2262000	It's not in the Standard Model at all.
2262000	2263000	Ok.
2263000	2264000	Ok.
2264000	2265000	Correct.
2265000	2266000	Ok.
2266000	2267000	Ok.
2267000	2268000	Ok.
2268000	2269000	Hello.
2269000	2270000	Hello.
2270000	2271000	Uh.
2271000	2272000	Ian seems to have a problem.
2272000	2273000	Ian.
2273000	2274000	Hello.
2274000	2275000	Because I can't see the projection now.
2275000	2276000	So you have to read it for me.
2276000	2277000	Hey.
2277000	2278000	Ian.
2278000	2279000	You have to turn on the microphone.
2279000	2280000	To ask.
2280000	2281000	Can't see.
2281000	2282000	Can't see.
2282000	2283000	Do you want to talk?
2283000	2284000	Ah.
2284000	2285000	Ok.
2285000	2286000	He said that.
2286000	2287000	Assuming.
2287000	2288000	Oh.
2288000	2289000	Uh.
2289000	2290000	Assuming now.
2290000	2291000	Dark Matter.
2291000	2292000	Uh.
2292000	2293000	Uh.
2293000	2294000	Uh.
2294000	2295000	Uh.
2295000	2296000	Uh.
2296000	2297000	Uh.
2297000	2298000	Uh.
2298000	2299000	Uh.
2299000	2300000	Uh.
2300000	2301000	Uh.
2301000	2302000	Yeah.
2302000	2303000	OK.
2303000	2304000	He only said.
2304000	2305000	I have to turn back for my microphone.
2305000	2306000	On the sound history.
2306000	2307000	He can finally speak.
2307000	2308000	Then there may be time to turn back.
2308000	2309000	Because...
2309000	2310000	The moment he speaks simple.
2310000	2311000	He wants to make.
2311000	2312000	You have to be able to say everything in English.
2312000	2313000	What?
2313000	2314000	What are you saying.
2314000	2315000	It's OK.
2315000	2316000	Don't need to be altered.
2316000	2317000	It doesn't matter.
2317000	2318000	It's OK.
2318000	2319000	You only have to be able to.
2319000	2320000	You worked hard.
2320000	2321000	It's OK.
2321000	2322000	We'll do this.
2322000	2323000	And there's another question.
2323000	2324000	Yes.
2324000	2325000	Which is.
2325000	2326000	Which is.
2326000	2327000	What Light matter model.
2327000	2328000	Is considered to be without dark matter.
2328000	2329000	Is considered.
2330000	2331000	Oh, no.
2331000	2332000	Yes, this is his question.
2332000	2333000	This thing is like this.
2333000	2334000	Just.
2334000	2336000	You take something very heavy.
2336000	2338000	To hit something very light.
2338000	2339000	What will the result be?
2339000	2340000	You take something very heavy.
2340000	2341000	Hit something very light.
2341000	2342000	We can imagine.
2342000	2343000	Take a truck.
2343000	2344000	Hit a window.
2344000	2345000	The light is hit very far.
2345000	2346000	Yes.
2346000	2347000	In fact.
2347000	2348000	The first signal you see.
2348000	2349000	It will be completely Nonsense.
2349000	2350000	Will be super big.
2350000	2351000	Then it's gone.
2351000	2352000	But in fact.
2352000	2353000	He just went through.
2353000	2354000	He won't leave the energy.
2354000	2355000	Sorry.
2355000	2356000	Uh.
2356000	2357000	I just said it wrong.
2357000	2358000	Because he will go straight through.
2358000	2359000	He won't put energy.
2359000	2360000	So he transferred the energy.
2360000	2361000	It will still be very strong.
2361000	2362000	Uh.
2362000	2363000	I have an equation here.
2363000	2364000	OK.
2364000	2365000	So this.
2365000	2366000	This is that equation.
2366000	2367000	That is to say.
2367000	2368000	If you go to calculate.
2368000	2369000	He left.
2369000	2370000	Hit.
2370000	2371000	Hit.
2371000	2372000	Because in fact.
2372000	2373000	Hit is the two people.
2373000	2374000	Common response.
2374000	2375000	He doesn't care.
2375000	2376000	Who hit who.
2376000	2377000	Because in fact.
2377000	2378000	In his execution.
2378000	2379000	They are hit.
2379000	2380000	You can't tell who hit who.
2380000	2381000	The most effective way.
2381000	2382000	Is to hit.
2382000	2383000	Hit.
2383000	2384000	Hit.
2384000	2385000	Hit.
2385000	2386000	The most effective way to pass energy to.
2386000	2387000	Another person.
2387000	2388000	Is.
2388000	2389000	Big M is greater than small M.
2389000	2390000	But whether it is.
2390000	2391000	Big M is greater than small M.
2391000	2392000	Or is small M greater than big M.
2392000	2393000	This number will be close to zero.
2393000	2394000	That is to say.
2394000	2395000	You won't leave the energy.
2395000	2396000	So.
2396000	2397000	This question is more like.
2397000	2398000	If today.
2398000	2399000	Dark Matter.
2399000	2400000	Really move like a proton.
2400000	2401000	Then we use electron.
2401000	2402000	Is it a good candidate?
2402000	2403000	The answer is no.
2403000	2404000	Because we will leave.
2404000	2405000	Very, very small energy.
2405000	2406000	We still can't measure.
2406000	2407000	But this thing.
2407000	2408000	Effectively.
2408000	2409000	Is all these experiments.
2409000	2410000	What to do.
2410000	2411000	But they didn't see anything.
2411000	2412000	So.
2412000	2413000	I want to try.
2413000	2414000	I have a question.
2414000	2415000	I want to ask.
2415000	2416000	You just said.
2416000	2417000	We can control.
2417000	2418000	Just.
2418000	2419000	Of course.
2419000	2420000	At first.
2420000	2421000	Use paper.
2421000	2422000	More.
2422000	2423000	More people use.
2423000	2424000	The method.
2424000	2425000	Then.
2425000	2426000	Because I can't find it.
2426000	2427000	So use electrons.
2427000	2428000	So you.
2428000	2429000	You just said.
2429000	2430000	We can control.
2430000	2431000	Paper and electrons.
2431000	2432000	What do you mean by control?
2432000	2433000	What does it mean?
2433000	2434000	If.
2434000	2435000	I said control.
2435000	2436000	In fact, it is.
2436000	2437000	You can spend money.
2437000	2438000	Easy to buy materials.
2438000	2439000	OK.
2439000	2440000	So.
2441000	2442000	OK.
2442000	2443000	Yes.
2443000	2444000	I will talk about some.
2444000	2445000	More exotic.
2445000	2446000	Yes.
2446000	2447000	Ah.
2447000	2448000	If the electronic.
2448000	2449000	If you can't find it.
2449000	2450000	Is it possible to use electricity?
2450000	2451000	Because in fact.
2451000	2452000	Electricity.
2452000	2453000	Electricity and electricity.
2453000	2454000	In fact.
2454000	2455000	It's about the same.
2455000	2456000	No.
2456000	2457000	OK.
2457000	2458000	OK.
2458000	2459000	Percentage.
2459000	2460000	That's about the same to me.
2460000	2461000	What we're talking about now is.
2461000	2462000	If you can find.
2462000	2463000	Smaller things.
2463000	2464000	For example, that kind.
2464000	2465000	Uh.
2465000	2466000	What is it called?
2466000	2467000	Dirac.
2467000	2468000	It's super.
2468000	2469000	So effectively.
2469000	2470000	You can destroy one.
2470000	2471000	For example.
2471000	2472000	Quasi-particle.
2472000	2473000	That's all possible.
2473000	2474000	But.
2474000	2475000	Very.
2475000	2476000	Expensive.
2476000	2477000	Ah.
2477000	2478000	Yes.
2478000	2479000	Good.
2479000	2480000	OK.
2480000	2481000	That.
2481000	2482000	OK.
2482000	2483000	Good.
2483000	2484000	Then I'll talk about it first.
2484000	2485000	That is.
2485000	2486000	Super CDMA.
2486000	2487000	HPEV detector.
2487000	2488000	This thing.
2488000	2489000	What is it?
2489000	2490000	Ahem.
2490000	2491000	Ahem.
2491000	2492000	OK.
2492000	2493000	Sorry.
2493000	2494000	Good.
2494000	2495000	Now here you see a picture.
2495000	2496000	This picture.
2496000	2497000	Is trying to describe this.
2497000	2498000	Germanium.
2498000	2499000	This.
2499000	2500000	The crystal.
2500000	2501000	OK.
2501000	2502000	It's a gold.
2502000	2503000	Black.
2503000	2504000	That's the white line.
2504000	2505000	Like this.
2505000	2506000	Hit him.
2506000	2507000	Then bounce away.
2507000	2508000	OK.
2508000	2509000	Then he left some energy.
2509000	2510000	What about this energy?
2510000	2511000	Will come out.
2511000	2512000	Ahem.
2512000	2513000	This will come out.
2513000	2514000	Shake this.
2514000	2515000	This crystal lattice.
2515000	2516000	So he'll shake there.
2516000	2517000	Vibrate.
2517000	2518000	That vibrates this thing.
2518000	2519000	It's actually a.
2519000	2520000	Signal.
2520000	2521000	It's called Fona.
2521000	2522000	OK.
2522000	2523000	And then.
2523000	2524000	At the same time, he'll hit this.
2524000	2525000	Electronic electric team.
2525000	2526000	Because he has enough energy.
2526000	2527000	He can.
2527000	2528000	He's next to the electronic electric team.
2528000	2529000	Sorry.
2529000	2530000	So.
2530000	2531000	Hey.
2531000	2532000	Then we have two signals.
2532000	2533000	Can measure.
2533000	2534000	One is this.
2534000	2535000	Lattice vibration.
2535000	2536000	It's called Fona.
2536000	2537000	Ah.
2537000	2538000	The other one is this.
2538000	2539000	Electronic electric team.
2539000	2540000	Ah.
2540000	2541000	So now.
2541000	2542000	How do you do it?
2542000	2543000	It's just that we put a big piece of this.
2543000	2544000	Crystal.
2544000	2545000	This is.
2545000	2546000	10 centimeters.
2546000	2547000	OK.
2547000	2548000	This is 10 centimeters.
2548000	2549000	What about its thickness?
2549000	2550000	It's 4.5 centimeters.
2550000	2551000	It's 5 centimeters.
2551000	2552000	It's a big piece.
2552000	2553000	You don't seem to be any.
2553000	2554000	The thickness of silicon used by TSMC.
2554000	2555000	It's a big one.
2555000	2556000	And then.
2556000	2557000	Let's take this thing.
2557000	2558000	Let it work.
2558000	2559000	Ah, when it's hit by Jack Berry.
2559000	2560000	At the time.
2560000	2561000	These fans will drift to it.
2561000	2562000	This one.
2562000	2563000	To Spread to this.
2563000	2564000	This crystal surface.
2564000	2565000	This one.
2565000	2567000	Hey, this electron pair is, too.
2567000	2570000	We'll pull it to the surface of a power plant.
2570000	2571000	What about now?
2571000	2572000	We're on this surface.
2572000	2573000	Do this microbi Britt consideration.
2573000	2575000	We're doing a guided circuit.
2575000	2576000	So, we're going to use this sugar to rival the arrows.
2576000	2577000	Interrupted by these two signals.
2577000	2578000	It really changes to measure the two clicks.
2578000	2579000	First, we calculate it.
2579000	2580000	We calculate pi 2025 by zeros.
2580000	2581000	And then we measure pi.
2581000	2582000	Well, we can adjust it.
2583000	2587000	Interrupt change to measure the Bacon and that organization.
2587000	2588000	Okay, this is the concept.
2588000	2592000	Okay, then he's got a lot of them in our video to do a different operation mode.
2592000	2593000	But what I want to talk about first is this.
2593000	2595000	I don't next to meet you.
2599000	2603000	Well, it's real, it's a side classical.
2603000	2606000	Now, come in hop okay.
2606000	2609000	Generate an otmomert here.
2609000	2610000	It's all electronic.
2610000	2615000	Okay, and then I'm here to give him a super big power plant.
2615000	2623000	Okay, then he's going to pull this electronic and electric, and he's going to rush up and down here very quickly.
2623000	2626000	Okay, and in the process?
2626000	2630000	Because this electronic electric will be far more than he can travel in this lattice.
2630000	2633000	The highest terminal velocity.
2633000	2636000	So what he's going to do is he's going to start generating.
2636000	2642000	He's going to lose or he's going to generate more energy into this.
2642000	2646000	Crystal inside to balance his speed, he's going to stay at terminal velocity.
2646000	2648000	So you're going to have a lot of this green arrow.
2648000	2650000	This is a secondary phenomenon.
2650000	2656000	Okay, so you can imagine if we give him a super big bias voltage.
2656000	2658000	He's going to generate a lot of wind.
2658000	2662000	So we basically just put an electronic electric signal.
2662000	2664000	Let him become a big power plant.
2664000	2666000	Let him become a super big wind signal.
2666000	2671000	And then we use this method to recover.
2671000	2675000	Oh, so we created a few electronic electric teams in front of us.
2675000	2678000	Okay, so we're going to use this method.
2678000	2682000	We just have to give him a few dozen to a hundred or two hundred volts of this power difference.
2682000	2687000	Then he can produce dozens of times to a hundred or two hundred times of this.
2688000	2692000	This is our approach.
2692000	2696000	Then we basically measure this purple piece, which is the sensor.
2696000	2701000	Okay, this is a piece of paper we published last year.
2701000	2703000	We made an R&D device.
2703000	2706000	This device is 2 centimeters.
2706000	2708000	This edge is 2 centimeters.
2708000	2710000	This is a silicon crystal.
2710000	2712000	It's 4 kilometers thick.
2712000	2714000	So it's 0.4 centimeters.
2714000	2716000	Then we added him.
2716000	2720000	We added him 150 volts of this.
2720000	2726000	Okay, so we're going to use this high voltage method to generate a lot of secondary.
2726000	2729000	Then we use this piece of silver.
2729000	2730000	I'll talk about it later.
2730000	2731000	To measure this wind.
2731000	2734000	Okay, so we can use this method.
2734000	2738000	What we get is this signal to noise ratio.
2738000	2742000	It's 0.7 percent of the electronic whole pair.
2743000	2745000	For example, this is a single electron hole.
2745000	2747000	This is a horizontal energy.
2747000	2750000	Then the axis is the histogram.
2750000	2752000	It doesn't matter what it is.
2752000	2754000	This is a single electron hole pair.
2754000	2758000	This is a signal of two, three, four electron hole pairs.
2758000	2759000	And what about its width?
2759000	2760000	It's about 7 percent.
2760000	2762000	That's what it means.
2762000	2765000	So we have resolution to see.
2765000	2769000	Counting this single, single, single, electron hole pair.
2769000	2772000	Okay, so we found that we can do it without fear.
2772000	2775000	Add this bias voltage to super big.
2775000	2778000	We can't see the super, super big signal to noise ratio.
2778000	2779000	The answer is no.
2779000	2782000	Because when we add more than one breakdown voltage.
2782000	2785000	This whole crystal becomes like a semiconductor.
2785000	2786000	It's like an island.
2786000	2789000	It's been crazy, it's been passing through.
2789000	2790000	It will smear.
2790000	2793000	We can count this dark matter signal ability.
2793000	2796000	So we do this breakdown voltage.
2797000	2800000	We found that we don't want to go beyond this breakdown voltage.
2800000	2803000	We operate at the bottom of the breakdown voltage.
2803000	2808000	We see that it will always have two or three hertz like this.
2808000	2810000	Two or three signals every second.
2810000	2813000	Then keep coming out, keep coming out.
2813000	2816000	The part that comes out is the pink part.
2816000	2818000	It's completely different from what we expect.
2818000	2821000	The signal that dark matter can produce is different.
2821000	2822000	So our assumption is that.
2822000	2823000	OK, there's a background here.
2823000	2824000	We don't know why.
2824000	2825000	It keeps leaking.
2825000	2826000	OK, but we don't know.
2826000	2828000	But based on such a background.
2828000	2834000	We can also set a limit.
2834000	2836000	Is it consistent with this background being or not?
2836000	2840000	OK, I'm going to do this calculation.
2840000	2841000	What about the calculation?
2841000	2843000	You can see the picture in the upper right corner.
2843000	2846000	OK, CDMS Run 1.
2846000	2848000	I just said.
2848000	2851000	In traditional experiments, we are all at 10 GeV.
2851000	2854000	Or higher to a few TeV to draw this limit.
2854000	2856000	But now I'm going back to the experiment.
2856000	2859000	We put this detector in our refrigerator.
2859000	2861000	Then I gave it a day and a night.
2861000	2863000	Then this detector is very small.
2863000	2865000	This detector is as big as a rubber band.
2865000	2868000	OK, we immediately set a world leading limit.
2868000	2871000	What is the world leading limit?
2871000	2872000	It's very simple.
2872000	2875000	It's not very sensitive to the very bottom.
2875000	2877000	It can measure very small probability.
2877000	2880000	It's just because we can be sensitive to very small energy.
2880000	2882000	So we drew a place where no one has ever been able to draw.
2882000	2884000	OK, you can see this place.
2884000	2885000	This is sub-mEV.
2885000	2887000	So 1 GeV is here.
2887000	2889000	10 GeV is what I said.
2889000	2891000	WIMP Search is from here to the right.
2891000	2892000	So we immediately drew a big piece here.
2892000	2894000	This is last year.
2894000	2897000	OK, let's say this is just a demonstration.
2897000	2902000	This concept is very efficient.
2902000	2904000	Then we are this year.
2904000	2906000	OK, we have to be very formal.
2906000	2910000	Let's make this thing a measurement on the ground.
2910000	2912000	Then we are actually yesterday.
2912000	2914000	We just unblinded all our data.
2914000	2916000	So we should be within a month.
2916000	2918000	Everyone doesn't have to sleep on Christmas.
2918000	2921000	Then we will put the pair on the archive.
2921000	2922000	So there will be a new one in a month.
2922000	2924000	Then stay tuned.
2924000	2929000	I can't talk about numbers, but I can say.
2929000	2932000	We redesigned this R&D device.
2932000	2934000	Because we are from here.
2934000	2936000	Then go over here and compare it.
2936000	2940000	Theoretically, this should be a resolution detector.
2940000	2941000	Then we see the difference.
2941000	2942000	Then we understand it.
2942000	2944000	We redesigned.
2944000	2950000	Then the resolution is significantly improved.
2950000	2953000	Then what's more important is.
2953000	2954000	Back to just now.
2954000	2956000	Because I said it would have two or three hertz of leakage.
2956000	2958000	Because I don't understand this leakage.
2958000	2961000	So if there is a leakage to a certain extent.
2961000	2962000	I said OK.
2962000	2964000	Then cut it off here.
2964000	2966000	The above is a good detector.
2966000	2968000	It's hard for me to say anything below.
2968000	2969000	Because my background is too high.
2969000	2972000	So the most important, the most crucial, is to set a limit.
2972000	2974000	In fact, it is to reduce this leakage.
2974000	2977000	Then we are actually Achieve Leakage Current Reduction Goal.
2977000	2979000	So this is very important.
2979000	2981000	What's more interesting is.
2981000	2983000	We have been in this year or so.
2983000	2985000	In fact, nearly two years.
2985000	2989000	We know more about Silicon Crystal.
2989000	2991000	Interaction with its environment.
2991000	2992000	So we can model.
2992000	2994000	That is, these can be produced.
2994000	2997000	Not quantized signal.
2997000	2999000	What is the distribution?
2999000	3001000	Then we can model it.
3001000	3003000	So basically, I can say.
3003000	3005000	We project to set again.
3005000	3007000	We're leading limit.
3007000	3008000	If not discovery.
3008000	3009000	So stay tuned.
3009000	3011000	This is what happens.
3011000	3013000	Okay, so here is CDMSHVEV.
3013000	3015000	Is there a problem?
3015000	3017000	This is a concept.
3017000	3018000	Because it's more like saying.
3018000	3020000	I want to talk about technology later.
3020000	3021000	But if you have any questions about this part.
3021000	3023000	You can ask now.
3027000	3029000	OK, if you don't have any questions.
3029000	3031000	Welcome to take a look.
3031000	3033000	This 180410697.
3033000	3035000	This, right.
3035000	3038000	It should be HVEV and Sensai.
3038000	3040000	Are the two that can be set to the lowest.
3040000	3042000	What is this called?
3042000	3046000	Gathering the cross-section experiment.
3046000	3048000	Right.
3048000	3050000	Okay.
3050000	3052000	Then go down.
3052000	3054000	The rest of the part I want to talk about is this.
3054000	3056000	Before I talk about it.
3056000	3058000	I want to talk about it first.
3058000	3060000	In the detector I just showed.
3060000	3062000	What is his technology?
3062000	3064000	OK, now you see a little.
3064000	3066000	A little, a little, a little, a little.
3066000	3068000	It's a piece of metal.
3068000	3070000	Then we put it in this.
3070000	3072000	It will become a super conductor.
3072000	3074000	OK, then.
3074000	3076000	If there is a pink part today.
3076000	3078000	The pink part is just that.
3078000	3080000	The big piece of that.
3080000	3082000	If I produce this interaction today.
3082000	3084000	Then it will float up.
3084000	3086000	Then go into this silver part.
3086000	3088000	OK, it will destroy this.
3088000	3090000	Then this will float in all the way.
3090000	3092000	What about this floating in?
3092000	3094000	Sorry, it destroys.
3094000	3096000	It's called QP.
3096000	3098000	Then it will change this.
3098000	3100000	The state of the conductor.
3100000	3102000	OK, it will be from.
3102000	3104000	This is the original conductor.
3104000	3106000	The horizontal axis is the conductor.
3106000	3108000	The horizontal axis is the effective temperature.
3108000	3110000	That little silver effective temperature.
3110000	3112000	OK, he was originally a zero conductor.
3112000	3114000	Will be very fast transition to.
3114000	3116000	There are nine conductors.
3116000	3118000	It's a normal conductor.
3118000	3120000	Then we just put it.
3120000	3122000	In this state of this transition.
3122000	3124000	As long as there is a little temperature.
3124000	3126000	Or the change of energy in this film.
3126000	3128000	This little inside.
3128000	3130000	We can see a big signal.
3130000	3132000	We use this method to measure.
3132000	3134000	But there are some problems.
3134000	3136000	His problem is.
3136000	3138000	This is a phase transition.
3138000	3140000	So his range is very small.
3140000	3142000	From a little energy to.
3142000	3144000	It's full, it's just a little bit.
3144000	3146000	So his dynamic range.
3146000	3148000	Is very small.
3148000	3150000	That's usually what you need.
3150000	3152000	Extra.
3152000	3154000	Circuit.
3154000	3156000	And it's going to be in the fridge.
3156000	3158000	To help him dissipate energy.
3158000	3160000	Or help him divert that energy.
3160000	3162000	Feedback, so we can.
3162000	3164000	It's really stable.
3164000	3166000	Operate our detector in this.
3166000	3168000	Transition.
3168000	3170000	And then, because he's actually a film.
3170000	3172000	He's from a zero conductor to a conductor.
3172000	3174000	It's also a super small conductor.
3174000	3176000	So he's a conventional.
3176000	3178000	The impedance of this electronics.
3178000	3180000	Is not match.
3180000	3182000	So he usually requires.
3182000	3184000	This is a cryo electronics.
3184000	3186000	To do this.
3186000	3188000	When it's time to do it.
3188000	3190000	Low impedance match.
3190000	3192000	So this is usually.
3192000	3194000	This is a very troublesome thing.
3194000	3196000	And the most important thing is.
3196000	3198000	Typical can be used to do this.
3198000	3200000	Transition edge sensor material.
3200000	3202000	It's actually not suitable.
3202000	3204000	Come to this.
3204000	3206000	So it really has to be produced.
3206000	3208000	A ts sensor that can catch phonon.
3208000	3210000	We also have a trapper.
3210000	3212000	Put these phonons.
3212000	3214000	Let him run over there, so there are several layers.
3214000	3216000	Then this micro fabrication is very complicated.
3216000	3218000	Then why do I want to talk about those?
3218000	3220000	Because those are basically this kid.
3220000	3222000	The problem of the customer service.
3222000	3224000	Then I'll talk about how to do it.
3224000	3226000	This operation is good.
3226000	3228000	The same energy comes in today.
3228000	3230000	This picture is the earliest paper.
3230000	3232000	He was imagined to be hit by light.
3232000	3234000	But you can imagine.
3234000	3236000	After he broke up.
3236000	3238000	He's on that.
3238000	3240000	The effect of the metal on it.
3240000	3242000	It's not just the change of the conductor.
3242000	3244000	It will also produce.
3244000	3246000	The change of the electric sense.
3246000	3248000	The change of the electric sense and the change of the conductor is not the same.
3248000	3250000	The superconductor.
3250000	3252000	It's been produced all the time.
3252000	3254000	He won't have a conductor.
3254000	3256000	Until the transition.
3256000	3258000	Suddenly, a lot of changes.
3258000	3260000	And then he went to the normal state.
3260000	3262000	But if today is.
3262000	3264000	Inductance.
3264000	3266000	The change of being broken.
3266000	3268000	In fact, it is relatively low function.
3268000	3270000	He can operate at a lower temperature.
3270000	3272000	That is to say, as long as I have one.
3272000	3274000	Enough ice in the refrigerator.
3274000	3276000	The transition temperature is much lower than mine.
3276000	3278000	I can operate.
3278000	3280000	In fact, I do not need to care.
3280000	3282000	Do I have a very complicated electronic?
3282000	3284000	Can control it?
3284000	3286000	This is very important.
3286000	3288000	What I'm talking about today is the change of the electric sense.
3288000	3290000	How do we make it a good sensor?
3290000	3292000	This is a variable electric sense.
3292000	3294000	I put it together with a capacitor.
3294000	3296000	It becomes a vibrator.
3296000	3298000	OK, so if today.
3298000	3300000	This electric sense is.
3300000	3302000	Eat a little energy.
3302000	3304000	A little change.
3304000	3306000	That's frequency space today.
3306000	3308000	OK, so frequency space.
3308000	3310000	This is F, this is S21.
3310000	3312000	If you do micro wave S21.
3312000	3314000	Then there is a resonance.
3314000	3316000	He will run.
3316000	3318000	And because there are more inside.
3318000	3320000	This thermodynamic activity.
3320000	3322000	In fact, it is a quasi-particle recombination.
3322000	3324000	So this resonator.
3324000	3326000	Or this resonator.
3326000	3328000	This quality factor will be reduced.
3328000	3330000	So it's not just this.
3330000	3332000	Resonance frequency will run.
3332000	3334000	Its fat will become fat.
3334000	3336000	So it will be like this.
3336000	3338000	From this black to the dot, then run back.
3338000	3340000	Then we look at this.
3340000	3342000	OK, we will know that.
3342000	3344000	Oh, here is the signal.
3344000	3346000	In fact, how do we realize such a circuit?
3346000	3348000	Actually nothing.
3348000	3350000	Just put it all together.
3350000	3352000	We have a lot of this little.
3352000	3354000	LC, LC, LC.
3354000	3356000	Then put it all together.
3356000	3358000	Then I measured its transmission.
3358000	3360000	Or S21.
3360000	3362000	I just put all these.
3362000	3364000	These resonators.
3364000	3366000	The resonant frequency is slightly adjusted to be different.
3366000	3368000	Then I measured S21 today.
3368000	3370000	You will see one by one.
3370000	3372000	One by one, one by one, one by one, one by one.
3372000	3374000	OK, then this resonance.
3374000	3376000	Will map to, for example, I know.
3376000	3378000	By design, this person.
3378000	3380000	He should resonate at this frequency.
3380000	3382000	This person should resonate at this frequency.
3382000	3384000	So I just monitor this one.
3384000	3386000	I know he was hit.
3386000	3388000	This one runs.
3388000	3390000	I know he was hit.
3390000	3392000	So this.
3392000	3394000	This is how we do this pixelization.
3394000	3396000	This concept.
3396000	3398000	In fact, you can see that this is a waveguide.
3398000	3400000	Then this is a.
3400000	3402000	Electrical circuit.
3402000	3404000	Then this is a capacitor.
3404000	3406000	This waveguide is coupled to it.
3406000	3408000	This waveguide is coupled to it.
3408000	3410000	In fact, everyone will see it like this.
3410000	3412000	There is a waveguide here.
3412000	3414000	Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.
3414000	3416000	OK.
3416000	3418000	Then every little island.
3418000	3420000	It's all a pixel.
3420000	3422000	Sorry, but we can go back.
3422000	3424000	Compare to say.
3424000	3426000	What if you use TES?
3426000	3428000	Because the TES is too small.
3428000	3430000	Small to measure.
3430000	3432000	You have to put a lot of this little island.
3432000	3434000	All connected.
3434000	3436000	So in fact, these people are all connected.
3436000	3438000	Make a sensor together.
3438000	3440000	These people are all connected together.
3440000	3442000	So this chip.
3442000	3444000	2 cm by 2 cm.
3444000	3446000	It's just two channels.
3446000	3448000	The signals are all clamped together.
3448000	3450000	But a 3-inch wafer like this.
3450000	3452000	It's 80 channels.
3452000	3454000	Then we now think that 80 channels.
3454000	3456000	Do this.
3456000	3458000	Positioning is good enough.
3458000	3460000	So we don't actually have to push this detector anymore.
3460000	3462000	We may have to take this detector.
3462000	3464000	To do the dark matter search.
3464000	3466000	But we are for this thing.
3466000	3468000	Some analysis of robustness.
3468000	3470000	I don't know if there's a paper here.
3470000	3472000	If you can go and see.
3472000	3474000	We think we can put 200 channels.
3474000	3476000	Then there will be no confusion.
3476000	3478000	So basically.
3478000	3480000	This is the future super cdms no lab detector.
3480000	3482000	There are a lot of little dots.
3482000	3484000	But they are all connected together.
3484000	3486000	So in the end, this big piece is a pixel.
3486000	3488000	This big piece is a pixel.
3488000	3490000	It probably looks like this.
3490000	3492000	It has 6 pixels.
3492000	3494000	Then we have 80.
3494000	3496000	Then we can do more than 200.
3496000	3498000	Because in fact.
3498000	3500000	Energy resolution wise.
3500000	3502000	We have measured.
3502000	3504000	Comparable energy resolution.
3504000	3506000	But more importantly.
3506000	3508000	Recent results suggest.
3508000	3510000	We can do sub-EB resolution.
3510000	3512000	Then of course.
3512000	3514000	In money wise.
3514000	3516000	It reduces 60% of fabrication complexity.
3516000	3518000	Because in fact.
3518000	3520000	This whole piece.
3520000	3522000	Is single layer film.
3522000	3524000	So.
3524000	3526000	Compared with this.
3526000	3528000	We are actually a mask.
3528000	3530000	Then deposit.
3530000	3532000	Then etch.
3532000	3534000	Then we have a complete whole circuit.
3534000	3536000	So we reduced.
3536000	3538000	60% to 70% of this.
3538000	3540000	If we go to calculate the steps.
3540000	3542000	Then the chemical used is much less.
3542000	3544000	So this fabrication EO is much higher.
3544000	3546000	And we can easily do.
3546000	3548000	100 times of this.
3548000	3550000	Pixelization.
3550000	3552000	Is multiplexibility.
3552000	3554000	Then.
3554000	3556000	We don't need thermoelectric feedback.
3556000	3558000	We just need to.
3558000	3560000	Make it much lower than TC.
3560000	3562000	Then we don't need.
3562000	3564000	Squid amplifier.
3564000	3566000	Because in fact by design.
3566000	3568000	This waveguide is 50 ohms.
3568000	3570000	So we only need 50 ohms.
3570000	3572000	Just connect two coax.
3572000	3574000	So this is very simple.
3574000	3576000	This is very important to CLR.
3576000	3578000	Then this is the second page.
3578000	3580000	Then let's talk about.
3580000	3582000	How high can we expect?
3582000	3584000	Because we are dominated by.
3584000	3586000	Low-noise amplifier.
3586000	3588000	So in other words.
3588000	3590000	As long as I can lower my.
3590000	3592000	The noise temperature of the amplifier.
3592000	3594000	I can.
3594000	3596000	Increase my.
3596000	3598000	Resolution here.
3598000	3600000	Then we use this amplifier now.
3600000	3602000	5K noise temperature.
3602000	3604000	Then our collaborator in JPL.
3604000	3606000	He made a low-noise.
3606000	3608000	Low-noise amplifier.
3608000	3610000	So I just change this to me.
3610000	3612000	I have a factor here.
3612000	3614000	OK.
3614000	3616000	Then.
3616000	3618000	We found one thing.
3618000	3620000	We have to do this match filter.
3620000	3622000	Filter what is noise.
3622000	3624000	What is this pulse template.
3624000	3626000	If we have this today.
3626000	3628000	This pulse decay time.
3628000	3630000	This time constant is longer.
3630000	3632000	We can be on this match filter.
3632000	3634000	Filter more of this.
3634000	3636000	Noise spectrum.
3636000	3638000	Then this characteristic.
3638000	3640000	If the characteristic time of this film becomes longer.
3640000	3642000	We can.
3642000	3644000	Increase better signal to noise ratio.
3644000	3646000	In this paper.
3646000	3648000	Demonstrate that they can put this time.
3648000	3650000	Increase to 3ms.
3650000	3652000	Then we are now 100 microseconds.
3652000	3654000	So OK.
3654000	3656000	Then I put this factor in.
3656000	3658000	Do I put this factor in?
3658000	3660000	OK.
3660000	3662000	Let's not say 3000.
3662000	3664000	Let's say 1500 microseconds.
3664000	3666000	This is actually my boss.
3666000	3668000	Another experiment.
3668000	3670000	They put.
3670000	3672000	This part.
3672000	3674000	Made into material.
3674000	3676000	What does it mean?
3676000	3678000	He put this sensitive inductor.
3678000	3680000	Really we can measure.
3680000	3682000	Material.
3682000	3684000	The other part.
3684000	3686000	Another kind.
3686000	3688000	The gap is bigger.
3688000	3690000	Bigger material.
3690000	3692000	So they won't eat the wind.
3692000	3694000	By this difference.
3694000	3696000	Just by this geometric ratio.
3696000	3698000	He can increase his sensitivity.
3698000	3700000	Then we can do the same thing.
3700000	3702000	That is actually one more layer.
3702000	3704000	Much less than TS.
3704000	3706000	Then we add it up.
3706000	3708000	This ratio.
3708000	3710000	Then.
3710000	3712000	Recently.
3712000	3714000	Recently, there is one in Europe.
3714000	3716000	Do that group.
3716000	3718000	They are doing this thing.
3718000	3720000	They propose a very interesting one.
3720000	3722000	We actually have to calculate.
3722000	3724000	How much we have created.
3724000	3726000	So if you are today.
3726000	3728000	This superconductor.
3728000	3730000	Very small.
3730000	3732000	Very small.
3732000	3734000	You can break a lot.
3734000	3736000	So they used this.
3736000	3738000	Low gap.
3738000	3740000	Very small.
3740000	3742000	This material.
3742000	3744000	We use aluminum now.
3744000	3746000	They can use it.
3746000	3748000	From 0.2.
3748000	3750000	0.2.
3750000	3752000	0.2.
3752000	3754000	0.05.
3754000	3756000	This is also a change.
3756000	3758000	So we put everything.
3758000	3760000	Has been demonstrated.
3760000	3762000	Bring it all in.
3762000	3764000	We will.
3764000	3766000	Bring in the resolution we already have.
3766000	3768000	Rescale.
3768000	3770000	The result we get is 36.
3770000	3772000	That is to say.
3772000	3774000	We are no longer doing.
3774000	3776000	Or we do.
3776000	3778000	Ionization counting.
3778000	3780000	We basically have 36.
3780000	3782000	Resolution.
3782000	3784000	Of course, we can take this thing.
3784000	3786000	Take it instead of TES.
3786000	3788000	Continue to put it on the silicon substrate.
3788000	3790000	Test this.
3790000	3792000	Or this ionization.
3792000	3794000	Then we can do another thing.
3794000	3796000	Is that we put a bunch of kids over there.
3796000	3798000	Directly take the kids to the dark matter.
3798000	3800000	Then we can count.
3800000	3802000	This kind of quantum.
3802000	3804000	This is our plan.
3804000	3806000	Summarize.
3806000	3808000	We think now.
3808000	3810000	Within 5 to 10 years.
3810000	3812000	Humans can either find WIMP.
3812000	3814000	Or we will have a long one.
3814000	3816000	No progress.
3816000	3818000	So everyone is now.
3818000	3820000	Working hard to think about it.
3820000	3822000	Can we shift to low mass dark matter?
3822000	3824000	There are still a lot of models.
3824000	3826000	Not tested yet.
3826000	3828000	We need to have.
3828000	3830000	Electron recoil and nuclear recoil.
3830000	3832000	Two at the same time.
3832000	3834000	Because in fact.
3834000	3836000	In addition to electronic recoil.
3836000	3838000	Can measure very small energy.
3838000	3840000	Nuclear recoil can help us distinguish.
3840000	3842000	What is the signal?
3842000	3844000	What is the background?
3844000	3846000	This is an important thing to start now.
3846000	3848000	Requires substantial improvement.
3848000	3850000	In low-threshold technology.
3850000	3852000	This is the second part.
3852000	3854000	CDMX HPEV demonstration.
3854000	3856000	We have the ability to count.
3856000	3858000	We give it a day.
3858000	3860000	One day on the surface of the lab.
3860000	3862000	We can set a good limit.
3862000	3864000	Of course, our detector.
3864000	3866000	Has been taken to the tunnel.
3866000	3868000	So the next round.
3868000	3870000	Will be the underground round.
3874000	3876000	One day on the surface of the lab.
3876000	3878000	We can constrain.
3878000	3880000	0.4 MeV dark matter mass.
3882000	3884000	The most important thing is the KIT part.
3884000	3886000	We demonstrate competitive energy resolution.
3886000	3888000	The most important thing is.
3888000	3890000	It is actually.
3890000	3892000	Theoretical prediction.
3892000	3894000	If we put all the design numbers.
3894000	3896000	It is quite consistent.
3896000	3898000	Then we are confident.
3898000	3900000	So we can adapt.
3900000	3902000	What others have demonstrated.
3902000	3904000	Assuming we really have.
3904000	3906000	So many resources to adapt.
3906000	3908000	Each one.
3908000	3910000	Its outlook is 100 times.
3910000	3912000	Resolution improvement.
3912000	3914000	It is.
3914000	3916000	Flexible optimization.
3916000	3918000	You want good energy resolution.
3918000	3920000	Just make a pixel.
3920000	3922000	Let all the photons hit you.
3922000	3924000	Or you can do 500 pixels.
3924000	3926000	Then you can have a good.
3926000	3928000	Position reconstruction or tracking.
3928000	3930000	In other words.
3930000	3932000	You can reject the background.
3932000	3934000	When we really want to run dark matter devices.
3934000	3936000	This will still need to be redesigned.
3936000	3938000	And then the point is.
3938000	3940000	It is very easy and reliable fabrication.
3940000	3942000	This is very important for the future.
3942000	3944000	Because the students know.
3944000	3946000	It is very likely that the device has not been done well.
3946000	3948000	So if it's easy to do, it's very important.
3948000	3950000	OK.
3950000	3952000	Because it is very simple.
3952000	3954000	It basically does not have.
3954000	3956000	Just put in an amplifier.
3956000	3958000	Then you can run.
3958000	3960000	OK, that's it.
3960000	3962000	Thank you.
3962000	3964000	Hello everyone.
3964000	3966000	Does anyone have a question?
3966000	3968000	We are good.
3968000	3970000	Good.
3970000	3972000	Good.
3972000	3974000	Good.
3974000	3976000	Good.
3976000	3978000	Good.
3978000	3980000	Good.
3980000	3982000	Good.
3982000	3984000	Good.
3984000	3986000	Good.
3986000	3988000	Good.
3988000	3990000	Good.
3990000	3992000	I want to ask.
3992000	3994000	That is.
3994000	3996000	Is that Ding Zhaozhong.
3996000	3998000	His group is looking for WIMP.
4000000	4002000	And this is not even about to the device?
4004000	4006000	To the space or test.
4006000	4008000	The test is actually done on earth.
4008000	4010000	If we want to.
4010000	4012000	The environment of this experiment.
4012000	4014000	A better environment.
4014000	4016000	Not actually going to the sky.
4016000	4018000	Because we actually measured directly.
4018000	4022000	We hope to go through everything we already know.
4022000	4024000	All kinds of things.
4024000	4026000	And then hit our detector.
4026000	4028000	But our environment is full of cosmic rays.
4028000	4030000	So we actually have the best environment.
4030000	4032000	It's underground.
4032000	4034000	It can be very natural to use the earth's shell to help us isolate the cosmic rays.
4034000	4036000	But we already know.
4036000	4038000	Can go through almost everything.
4038000	4040000	You go to the bottom of the moon.
4040000	4042000	Relatively, you show off the more cosmic rays.
4042000	4044000	But the rate you leave.
4044000	4046000	That is.
4046000	4048000	So most of our experiments are.
4048000	4050000	Eventually, it's going to be done underground.
4050000	4052000	For example, mines and so on.
4052000	4054000	But Ding Zhaozhong's experiment.
4054000	4056000	If you're talking about AMS or AMS.
4056000	4058000	What if it's 02 now?
4058000	4060000	He's not measuring dark matter.
4060000	4062000	He's measuring cosmic rays.
4062000	4064000	The anomaly.
4064000	4066000	And then if this anomaly.
4066000	4068000	It's a very, very strong anomaly.
4068000	4070000	They can try to explain.
4070000	4072000	So is there any dark matter?
4072000	4074000	For example, decay.
4074000	4076000	Or produce such anomalies.
4076000	4078000	For example, suddenly there is a certain kind of energy.
4078000	4080000	On the spectrum of cosmic rays.
4080000	4082000	There are a lot of non-continuous peaks.
4082000	4084000	Then it might be dark matter.
4084000	4086000	So they're actually measuring cosmic rays.
4086000	4088000	So they want to go to the strongest part of the cosmic rays.
4088000	4090000	So they want to go to the atmosphere.
4090000	4092000	Because the atmosphere will actually block the cosmic rays.
4092000	4094000	So they went to the space station.
4094000	4096000	The principle is probably like this.
4096000	4098000	OK.
4104000	4106000	OK.
4106000	4108000	OK.
4108000	4110000	OK.
4110000	4112000	OK.
4112000	4114000	I want to ask another question.
4114000	4116000	OK.
4116000	4118000	It's a bit of an unexpected.
4118000	4120000	But.
4120000	4122000	I want to ask if there is anyone.
4122000	4124000	You're measuring those photons now.
4124000	4126000	Right?
4126000	4128000	And then magnify the signal.
4128000	4130000	Is there anyone.
4130000	4132000	Like using that legal.
4132000	4134000	That is, he measured.
4134000	4136000	For example, you hit it.
4136000	4138000	Then there may be some very small particles.
4138000	4140000	Yes.
4140000	4142000	I actually.
4142000	4144000	I really like this kind of research.
4144000	4146000	Because.
4146000	4148000	You can ask a very legitimate question.
4148000	4150000	That is to say.
4150000	4152000	In fact, we are now.
4152000	4154000	All dark matter will be blocked by us.
4154000	4156000	Interaction is imaginary.
4156000	4158000	Because the only thing we know.
4158000	4160000	Dark matter will really interact.
4160000	4162000	Observed is through gravity.
4162000	4164000	If I say I'm going to design an experiment.
4164000	4166000	Is to use gravity as gravity.
4166000	4168000	To measure dark matter.
4168000	4170000	How sensitive do I want to be?
4170000	4172000	Or what kind of model is dark matter?
4172000	4174000	I measured it.
4174000	4176000	Basically, your question is like this.
4176000	4178000	The answer is.
4178000	4180000	Someone is thinking about this.
4180000	4182000	It's not that I can't do it.
4182000	4184000	But the first dark matter is very, very heavy.
4184000	4186000	How heavy is it?
4186000	4188000	It's about 0.0.
4188000	4190000	Planck's mass.
4190000	4192000	I don't know if you know Planck's mass.
4192000	4194000	We think all gravity.
4194000	4196000	The theory will break down the physical limit.
4196000	4198000	Now.
4198000	4200000	Now we are discussing these scales.
4200000	4202000	What 30 times.
4202000	4204000	No, sorry.
4206000	4208000	Then.
4208000	4210000	This is what they are thinking about.
4210000	4212000	They can use laser.
4212000	4214000	Put some nanoparticles.
4214000	4216000	Press it with laser light.
4216000	4218000	Hold nanoparticles.
4218000	4220000	Then take it.
4220000	4222000	Line up in a vacuum chamber.
4222000	4224000	Line up in a vacuum chamber.
4224000	4226000	These nanoparticles.
4226000	4228000	If the little pig is hit by dark matter.
4228000	4230000	No, sorry.
4230000	4232000	It is passed by dark matter.
4232000	4234000	Then the weight of the dark matter particle.
4234000	4236000	Will affect the position of these little pigs.
4236000	4238000	Then they will start to shake.
4238000	4240000	It's like a gravity wave.
4240000	4242000	The mirror of LIGO.
4242000	4244000	They can use this method to measure.
4244000	4246000	But I think this is a good question.
4246000	4248000	And someone is doing R&D.
4250000	4252000	This is very interesting.
4252000	4254000	This is very interesting.
4272000	4274000	Can I ask?
4274000	4276000	Strange details.
4276000	4278000	Why do you use such a thick wafer?
4278000	4280000	Why do you use such a thick wafer?
4280000	4282000	Or is the whole piece of silicon?
4282000	4284000	Or is the whole piece of silicon?
4284000	4286000	Yes, the whole piece is silicon.
4286000	4288000	Ok, I'll leave it here.
4288000	4290000	In fact, this thickness is so thick.
4290000	4292000	This is 10 cm.
4292000	4294000	This is 4 inches.
4294000	4296000	4 inches wafer.
4296000	4298000	The thickness is a big piece.
4298000	4300000	It's like a big piece of silicon.
4300000	4302000	You don't cut it into pieces.
4302000	4304000	You cut it into pieces.
4304000	4306000	This is not a wafer crystal.
4306000	4308000	Why do you do this?
4308000	4310000	Because we found one thing.
4310000	4312000	Of course you can say that my thickness is 1 km.
4312000	4314000	And then I have 10 pieces.
4314000	4316000	Or my thickness is 1 cm.
4316000	4318000	But I only have one piece.
4318000	4320000	Its total mass.
4320000	4322000	Or the total number of neutron protons it gives you.
4322000	4324000	It's the same.
4324000	4326000	So in theory, your experimental sensitivity is the same.
4326000	4328000	But we found one thing.
4328000	4330000	In the whole process of fabrication.
4330000	4332000	And in the process of transportation.
4332000	4334000	The cosmic radiation has been constantly hitting.
4334000	4336000	The cosmic radiation has been constantly hitting.
4336000	4338000	And then there's a lot of dirt in the air.
4338000	4340000	A lot of radioactivity has also been touching our wafer.
4340000	4342000	And then there's a lot of dirt in the air.
4342000	4344000	And then there's a lot of radioactivity has also been touching our wafer.
4344000	4346000	Whether it's sticking or producing.
4346000	4348000	Whether it's sticking or producing.
4348000	4350000	These elements.
4350000	4352000	So minimize the surface area.
4352000	4354000	So minimize the surface area.
4354000	4356000	The total radioactivity of the whole experiment.
4356000	4358000	So we want it to be a big piece.
4358000	4360000	Not a lot of small pieces.
4360000	4362000	Not a lot of small pieces.
4362000	4364000	Does this make sense?
4364000	4366000	Does this make sense?
4366000	4368000	But I mean, why is it so thick?
4368000	4370000	But I mean, why is it so thick?
4370000	4372000	But I mean, why is it so thick?
4372000	4374000	Because it's very thick.
4374000	4376000	It means that it's very small on the same quality.
4376000	4378000	Or we have the same thickness.
4378000	4380000	Or we have the same total weight.
4380000	4382000	We can also use a thin piece of stone.
4382000	4384000	But its surface area is very large.
4384000	4386000	Ah, I see what you mean.
4386000	4388000	Ah, I see what you mean.
4388000	4390000	Ah, I see what you mean.
4390000	4392000	Ah, I see what you mean.
4392000	4394000	Can I ask a question?
4394000	4396000	How do you do calibration for detectors?
4396000	4398000	How do you do calibration for detectors?
4398000	4400000	How do you do calibration for detectors?
4400000	4402000	This is a bit complicated.
4402000	4404000	Let me talk about this first.
4404000	4406000	Let me talk about this first.
4406000	4408000	This HVEV.
4408000	4410000	We actually hit it with a laser.
4410000	4412000	We have a fiber.
4412000	4414000	We have a fiber.
4414000	4416000	We have a fiber.
4416000	4418000	Because you use a pulse laser.
4418000	4420000	Because you use a pulse laser.
4420000	4422000	We can see this spectrum.
4422000	4424000	We can see this spectrum.
4424000	4426000	This is calibration.
4426000	4428000	This is calibration.
