0	11000	Thank you very much today, Zhang Fengxun, PhD candidate, can give us an online speech.
11000	17000	I am the host, Zhou Zhiqian, who is currently working at MD Anderson as a postdoc.
17000	28000	Let me introduce you a little bit about Zhang Fengxun's current education experience.
28000	39000	In 2009, Zhang Fengxun obtained his master's degree from the Department of Insectology at NTU.
39000	51000	In 2013, he obtained his master's degree from the Department of Ecology and Biochemistry at NTU.
51000	66000	Then, he spent a year at UC California Berkeley as a visiting student researcher at the Department of Environmental Science Policy and Management.
66000	72000	Then, he transferred to the University of Michigan to obtain his doctorate.
72000	77000	His major is the School of Nature Research and Environmental.
77000	81000	Now, he is already a PhD candidate.
81000	86000	We are very honored to invite him to give us an online speech.
86000	91000	The topic of his speech today is
91000	101000	How does Ominary influence the effects of consumer diversity on research prey consumption?
101000	106000	Now, let's invite Zhang Fengxun to give us a speech. Thank you.
106000	110000	Thank you for the host's introduction.
111000	112000	Thank you.
112000	120000	The topic of my speech today is mainly a framework for my PhD thesis.
120000	125000	And the results I have made recently.
125000	131000	It's almost done, so I hope I can get some feedback from everyone.
131000	134000	My overarching question is
134000	144000	How does Ominary influence the effects of consumer diversity on research prey consumption?
144000	156000	How many resources are consumed by different consumers?
156000	166000	Before answering this question, I would like to briefly explain to everyone that the topic I have made is
166000	171000	Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning.
171000	175000	The question I want to answer in this subfield is
175000	180000	How does Ominary influence the functions of the entire system?
180000	183000	These functions are shown in this picture.
183000	187000	How many resources are consumed?
187000	190000	How many biomass are produced?
190000	196000	How are these functions influenced by the number of organisms in the system?
196000	201000	After many years of research,
201000	204000	we all think that
204000	208000	when there are more organisms in the system,
208000	212000	the function of the system will be higher and higher.
212000	217000	This is because different species have to live together at the same time.
217000	220000	They have to use different resources.
220000	225000	If the food I eat is different from the food you eat, we can live in harmony.
225000	229000	This is the concept of resource partitioning.
229000	231000	If it is a picture, you can look at it.
231000	237000	Assuming that the different X-axis on the right is a different resource.
237000	240000	For example, temperature or different pH of the soil.
241000	247000	The white circle in the middle is the resources needed by different organisms.
247000	250000	If different organisms occupy different resources,
250000	252000	they can live in harmony.
252000	257000	In addition to living in harmony, they can also use these resources more efficiently.
257000	263000	This is our consensus in the BEF subfield.
264000	265000	But there is a problem.
265000	270000	There are more than three-quarters of the research in this subfield.
270000	272000	It's all experimented with plants.
272000	274000	For example, in the picture on the left,
274000	278000	how many plants are there in the grass?
278000	280000	How many different kinds of grass?
280000	282000	How many organisms are there?
282000	286000	If it's in the animal community,
286000	288000	will we find the same thing?
288000	289000	The answer is,
289000	294000	Generally, we think that when the consumer diversity increases,
294000	297000	the ecosystem function should also increase.
297000	300000	But the pattern, the signal,
300000	304000	is not as obvious as in the plant community.
304000	307000	For example, in 2013, the Meta-Analysis
307000	313000	reported that it reviewed more than 40 studies.
313000	318000	More than half of them said that we did not see a positive correlation.
318000	323000	In other words, diversity does not have a positive impact on the function.
323000	326000	More than half of them said that we did not see a positive impact.
326000	328000	At this time, we will ask,
328000	329000	why is it like this?
329000	331000	Is it because animals and plants are different?
331000	335000	Don't they need to partition their resources to coexist?
335000	337000	Or are there other factors?
337000	341000	They don't need to partition to coexist.
341000	343000	This hypothesis is basically invalid.
343000	347000	Because it is impossible for two societies to use the same thing
347000	349000	and live well together.
349000	351000	It should be said that this case is very rare.
351000	354000	For example, in this study,
354000	356000	it is a very famous study.
356000	358000	It is in the seaweed bed.
358000	362000	The picture on the left is the seaweed bed in the sea.
362000	366000	There are different grazers on the seaweed bed.
366000	370000	You can think of it as different little prawns, little worms.
370000	372000	They will eat these seaweed.
372000	374000	They will also eat the algae on the seaweed.
374000	376000	As you can see,
376000	379000	when we have more grazers,
379000	383000	the overall biomass of the grazer can grow more.
383000	385000	We can also eat less algae.
385000	391000	For example, we still see diversity in the consumer community.
391000	393000	It has a positive impact on the function.
393000	398000	Especially the consumption of resources has a positive impact.
398000	400000	They also reported that
400000	402000	they saw this positive impact
402000	404000	because different grazers
404000	411000	tend to stay in different parts of the seaweed.
411000	414000	For example, this grazer will be in a shorter place.
414000	416000	This grazer will be in a straight place.
416000	418000	So they actually use different spaces.
418000	420000	In other words, they really use different resources.
420000	431000	So resource partitioning has a positive impact on diversity and function.
431000	435000	In other words, resource partitioning has a positive impact on function.
435000	436000	There is no problem.
436000	439000	But in fact, there are many experiments.
439000	447000	They said that animals not only eat the seaweed below.
447000	450000	Many animals actually eat other animals.
450000	452000	In other words, like humans,
452000	454000	we don't just eat plants.
454000	456000	We don't just eat meat.
456000	457000	We eat everything.
457000	459000	We are solid.
459000	462000	In other words, this meta-analysis
462000	464000	in the report of 2007,
464000	466000	it is a review of many food webs.
466000	470000	Many grazers measure their stomach content.
470000	472000	It really depends on what they eat.
472000	475000	They found that the vast majority of animals
475000	476000	are omnivores.
476000	478000	They are all solid.
478000	481000	The simplest example of a solid omnivore
481000	485000	is when we have a very simple food web.
485000	487000	Suppose there are only four species.
488000	490000	With two animals.
490000	492000	The simplest is called Intra-Cultivated.
492000	495000	For example, there is an animal that only eats
495000	499000	the resource below its stomach.
499000	501000	These species.
501000	502000	But there is another animal.
502000	504000	In addition to eating these resources,
504000	509000	it also ate the species that just ate the resource.
509000	515000	So this feeding link is the simplest omnivore.
515000	520000	So this is Intra-Cultivated IGP.
520000	523000	The simplest example of an omnivore.
523000	526000	When the omnivore occurs,
526000	529000	or when the Intra-Cultivated IGP occurs,
529000	534000	many studies have told us
534000	538000	that it will reduce the entire consumer function.
538000	540000	For example, in this study,
541000	543000	Grasshopper in this study.
543000	545000	What is this called?
545000	548000	What is it called?
548000	549000	Tooth bug.
549000	551000	No.
551000	553000	An insect that only eats grass.
553000	555000	I forgot what it's called in Chinese.
555000	557000	It's a pest.
557000	559000	Then it puts this pest
559000	563000	together with many other different animals.
563000	568000	See if these animals can eat this pest.
568000	570000	So in this experiment,
570000	571000	if there is no pest,
571000	572000	nothing,
572000	573000	only Grasshopper alone,
573000	575000	it can grow so much.
575000	577000	But if there are some pests,
577000	579000	some other consumers,
579000	582000	it only eats this grasshopper,
582000	583000	it can eat it very low,
583000	584000	almost none.
584000	586000	But if I put a lot of species in,
586000	588000	because these animals will eat each other
588000	589000	and eat each other,
589000	593000	so they eat less grasshopper overall.
593000	594000	In other words,
594000	596000	when the omnivore occurs,
596000	598000	or intragural predation,
598000	600000	a simple case occurs,
600000	601000	we will see that
601000	603000	consumer diversity
603000	606000	has a negative effect on the function.
606000	608000	So we can draw
608000	610000	a very simple memory map.
610000	612000	When resource partitioning occurs,
612000	614000	the consumer function will increase.
614000	616000	But when intragural predation occurs,
616000	618000	this function will decrease.
618000	619000	Consumer diversity
619000	622000	will have a negative effect on the function.
622000	624000	So in order to study
624000	626000	who is more important,
626000	627000	I asked a question.
627000	628000	My Ph.D.
628000	630000	The main question I want to answer is
630000	631000	resource partitioning
631000	632000	and omnivore,
632000	633000	these two things,
633000	634000	these two forces,
634000	635000	who is more important
635000	637000	to determine
637000	638000	animal diversity
638000	642000	and pre-consumption.
642000	646000	I have four ways
646000	650000	to answer this big question.
650000	651000	The first is
651000	652000	because I don't know
652000	654000	how omnivore,
654000	656000	I know it's probably negative,
656000	657000	but I don't know
657000	658000	how strong it is
658000	659000	to eliminate the benefits
659000	661000	of resource partitioning.
661000	663000	So I need to have a hypothesis first.
663000	664000	So the first step
664000	666000	is to make a mathematical model,
666000	668000	a theoretical model,
668000	671000	to help me
671000	672000	generate a hypothesis.
672000	674000	I can continue to do experiments later.
674000	675000	The second step is
675000	677000	I have a small experiment
677000	679000	in the lab
679000	680000	to verify that
680000	682000	the mathematical model
682000	684000	can really be discovered
684000	686000	in a biological object,
686000	688000	not just a mathematical calculation.
688000	689000	Then it seems like
689000	691000	I see something like this.
691000	692000	The next step is
692000	694000	because it was all in math just now,
694000	696000	it was all on paper,
696000	698000	or it was all just
698000	700000	in this kind of
700000	701000	well-controlled environment
701000	702000	in the lab.
702000	704000	So the third step is
704000	705000	I think the most important part
705000	706000	of this paper is
706000	708000	that I want to be able to
708000	710000	discover or not discover
710000	712000	this theory or experiment
712000	714000	in the wild.
714000	716000	This is how I can tell people
716000	718000	whether this is important or not.
718000	720000	Is this thing
720000	722000	important or not?
722000	723000	So the first step
723000	725000	is to make a mathematical model.
725000	726000	This mathematical model
726000	727000	is actually very simple.
727000	728000	I believe you all understand.
728000	730000	It's just a very simple
730000	733000	four ordinary differential equations
733000	736000	to describe the change in time
736000	738000	in a group.
738000	740000	Here we see P1 and P2
740000	744000	are the densities of a certain species,
744000	746000	or biomass.
746000	748000	The first one is that
748000	750000	their population growth rate
750000	752000	will follow this function.
752000	754000	Then this function
754000	756000	is actually a logistic regression,
756000	758000	but we don't have to understand it too much.
758000	759000	Anyway, it will grow.
759000	761000	There are two reasons for P1 and P2.
761000	762000	It will grow.
762000	764000	Then there are two zoomers,
764000	766000	which are two animals.
766000	768000	They will eat these two resources.
768000	770000	Z1 and Z2 will eat P1 and P2.
770000	772000	Then their consumption term
772000	775000	is described as their mathematical value.
775000	777000	Then here is a more important point.
777000	779000	I put a parameter S.
779000	783000	I use S to adjust
783000	785000	how much Z1 and Z2
785000	787000	are partitioned
787000	789000	or not partitioned.
789000	791000	So for example,
791000	793000	if Z1 is 1,
793000	795000	if S1 is 1,
795000	797000	Z1 will eat P2 completely,
797000	799000	but it doesn't eat P1 at all.
799000	803000	If S2 is 1,
803000	805000	Z2 will eat P1 completely,
805000	807000	and Z2 doesn't eat P2 at all.
807000	810000	Or in other words,
810000	813000	if Z1 or Z2 is 0.5,
813000	817000	if S1 or S2 is 0.5,
817000	819000	Z1 and Z2
819000	821000	will completely overlap their resources.
821000	825000	That is, half of their P1 and P2.
825000	827000	Next,
827000	829000	one of the consumers,
829000	831000	Z1, will be eaten by Z2.
831000	833000	I just described the simplest
833000	835000	example of an omnivore,
835000	837000	which is inter-game partition.
837000	839000	Z1 will be eaten by Z2.
841000	843000	So after having this model,
843000	847000	I can see these two parameters,
847000	849000	S1 and S2,
849000	851000	which will affect
851000	853000	how many resources are eaten overall.
855000	857000	I won't go into
857000	859000	the details of how to analyze this model.
859000	861000	It's just a process
861000	863000	of writing ODE.
863000	865000	Then,
865000	867000	the most important contribution
867000	869000	of this model is
869000	871000	to generate this hypothesis.
871000	873000	In other words,
873000	875000	when these two species
875000	877000	are in this state,
879000	881000	the overall resource density
881000	883000	will increase
883000	885000	with the intra-game partition,
885000	887000	which is the alpha just now,
887000	889000	and then decrease and then increase.
889000	891000	In other words,
891000	893000	this partition is completely different
893000	895000	from the intra-game partition
895000	897000	we thought at the beginning
897000	899000	or the omnivore
899000	901000	which will have a negative effect
901000	903000	on the consumer function.
903000	905000	It will eat more resources
905000	907000	when the omnivore is weak,
907000	909000	and then eat fewer resources
909000	911000	when the omnivore is strong.
911000	913000	That's why we see
913000	915000	this concave-up function.
917000	919000	This pattern is
919000	921000	no matter how high
921000	923000	or low my resource partition is,
923000	925000	I can see this function
925000	927000	going up and down.
927000	929000	For example, the intra-game partition
929000	931000	will let the consumer eat more resources
931000	933000	than the omnivore.
933000	935000	Now we have a hypothesis.
935000	937000	We are going to see
937000	939000	whether this math tells me
939000	941000	whether this pattern can be observed
941000	943000	on a real organism.
943000	945000	So I did a little experiment.
945000	947000	The first one is
947000	949000	my resource has
949000	951000	a bunch of bacteria.
951000	953000	These three are different bacteria.
953000	955000	Then there is
955000	957000	the first consumer,
957000	959000	which is the intra-game partition.
959000	961000	The first one only eats bacteria.
961000	963000	The second one
963000	965000	is the consumer
965000	967000	that eats bacteria at the same time
967000	969000	and eats
969000	971000	the other
971000	973000	consumer species.
975000	977000	So this is the
977000	979000	mathematical model
979000	981000	of the real organism.
981000	983000	I can't control
983000	985000	whether I want this one to eat more
985000	987000	or less,
987000	989000	so I have to adjust
989000	991000	or manipulate the
991000	993000	intra-game partition strength.
993000	995000	The method I use is
995000	997000	to take a net
997000	999000	and let the small
999000	1001000	intra-game partition
1001000	1003000	that only eats bacteria
1003000	1005000	run around.
1005000	1007000	However, the big one
1007000	1009000	will be limited
1009000	1011000	to the small one
1011000	1013000	if it is observed.
1013000	1015000	Then I use this net
1015000	1017000	to adjust
1017000	1019000	the position
1019000	1021000	in the bottle
1021000	1023000	of the experiment.
1023000	1025000	I can adjust
1025000	1027000	how many
1027000	1029000	consumers
1029000	1031000	will be exposed
1031000	1033000	to the risk of being eaten by the big one,
1033000	1035000	which is how high
1035000	1037000	or how close
1037000	1039000	their contact probability is.
1039000	1041000	If this net
1041000	1043000	is placed in the middle
1043000	1045000	of the intra-game partition,
1045000	1047000	then the
1047000	1049000	big one is less than the small one.
1049000	1051000	But if this net is
1051000	1053000	only about 20%
1053000	1055000	of the space
1055000	1057000	for the big one
1057000	1059000	to move,
1059000	1061000	then the intra-game partition strength
1061000	1063000	is 20.
1063000	1065000	The above picture
1065000	1067000	shows that I cut off
1067000	1069000	the bottom of the glass bottle
1069000	1071000	and glued the net in
1071000	1073000	to make an experiment
1073000	1075000	jar.
1077000	1079000	After this
1079000	1081000	is done,
1081000	1083000	I can test this hypothesis.
1083000	1085000	I want to see
1085000	1087000	if the density of
1087000	1089000	the bacteria
1089000	1091000	increases
1091000	1093000	with the
1093000	1095000	intra-game partition strength
1095000	1097000	and decreases
1097000	1099000	with the contact probability.
1099000	1101000	After the experiment,
1101000	1103000	we can see
1103000	1105000	that there is a
1105000	1107000	concave fob.
1107000	1109000	When the intra-game partition
1109000	1111000	increases,
1111000	1113000	when the resource density
1113000	1115000	reaches an equilibrium,
1115000	1117000	when the population
1117000	1119000	does not change too much,
1119000	1121000	the bacteria density
1121000	1123000	will decrease first.
1123000	1125000	Next,
1125000	1127000	I want to explain
1127000	1129000	whether this pattern is
1129000	1131000	true or not,
1131000	1133000	and whether the mechanism
1133000	1135000	is like my mathematical model.
1135000	1137000	If I put the mathematical model
1137000	1139000	on this experimental result,
1139000	1141000	you will find that
1141000	1143000	this black dot is
1143000	1145000	the result of the experiment.
1145000	1147000	This curve is the density
1147000	1149000	predicted by the mathematical model.
1149000	1151000	You will find that they are quite different.
1151000	1153000	This curve and
1153000	1155000	these black dots
1155000	1157000	hardly explain anything.
1157000	1159000	They just have a concave fob function.
1159000	1161000	This pattern is qualitatively
1161000	1163000	correct, but
1163000	1165000	quantitatively is
1165000	1167000	not accurate at all.
1167000	1169000	I can't use my model to explain
1169000	1171000	the result I saw in the lab.
1171000	1173000	There is a very important reason
1173000	1175000	why I can't use
1175000	1177000	my model.
1177000	1179000	When I describe the intra-game partition,
1179000	1181000	I use a type 1 functional response.
1181000	1183000	This type 1 functional response
1183000	1185000	means that
1185000	1187000	no matter how many prey
1187000	1189000	come to me,
1189000	1191000	I will eat them.
1191000	1193000	This is actually
1193000	1195000	unrealistic.
1195000	1197000	How can we keep eating
1197000	1199000	and eating and eating?
1199000	1201000	Its function is a linear
1201000	1203000	upward. This is not a reasonable
1203000	1205000	state.
1205000	1207000	I don't want to use this function.
1207000	1209000	I changed it to a more complex
1209000	1211000	non-linear function.
1211000	1213000	It will have a sense of satiety
1213000	1215000	when it eats.
1215000	1217000	Even if a bunch of food
1217000	1219000	comes, it will not
1219000	1221000	continue to eat more.
1221000	1223000	This is called type 2 functional response.
1223000	1225000	It looks like this.
1225000	1227000	When I change this
1227000	1229000	functional response from type 1 to type 2,
1229000	1231000	my model prediction
1231000	1233000	will be closer to
1233000	1235000	the result of the lab.
1235000	1237000	Although it is not
1237000	1239000	exactly the same,
1239000	1241000	the explanation
1241000	1243000	can explain
1243000	1245000	about 70% of the variation.
1245000	1247000	Mainly these two points.
1247000	1249000	The lab observed that
1249000	1251000	it was low enough.
1251000	1253000	I don't know why the model can't
1253000	1255000	be so low.
1255000	1257000	Almost 70%
1257000	1259000	of the explanation power
1259000	1261000	is quite satisfactory.
1261000	1263000	We can use
1263000	1265000	this model that has been changed
1265000	1267000	to explain
1267000	1269000	what really happened
1269000	1271000	in the real organism.
1273000	1275000	The model of type 2 functional response
1275000	1277000	that has been changed
1277000	1279000	can not only explain
1279000	1281000	bacterial density,
1281000	1283000	but also explain
1283000	1285000	the density of
1285000	1287000	the other two consumers,
1287000	1289000	Intragalepra and Praetor.
1289000	1291000	It also explains about 70%.
1291000	1293000	The prediction function
1293000	1295000	is very similar.
1295000	1297000	We can use this model
1297000	1299000	to explain what really happened
1299000	1301000	in the organism.
1301000	1303000	As I said,
1303000	1305000	it is type 2 functional response.
1305000	1307000	When there is a little bit of
1307000	1309000	Intragalepra
1309000	1311000	and Praetor,
1311000	1313000	when there is a little bit of
1313000	1315000	Praetor,
1315000	1317000	the Praetor
1317000	1319000	is more nutritious
1319000	1321000	than the bacteria.
1321000	1323000	We can't see the bacteria.
1323000	1325000	The Praetor is bigger
1325000	1327000	and more nutritious.
1327000	1329000	For example,
1329000	1331000	if we eat a little bit of
1331000	1333000	meat,
1333000	1335000	in theory,
1335000	1337000	we will grow bigger and healthier.
1337000	1339000	Although there are vegetarians,
1339000	1341000	if we eat a little bit of meat,
1341000	1343000	a little bit of food,
1343000	1345000	we will grow more.
1345000	1347000	We can see that
1347000	1349000	Intragalepra and Praetor
1349000	1351000	really grow bigger
1351000	1353000	and eat a little bit.
1353000	1355000	So,
1355000	1357000	when there are a lot of big Praetor
1357000	1359000	and
1359000	1361000	a few small Praetor,
1361000	1363000	they can eat
1363000	1365000	more bacteria
1365000	1367000	overall.
1369000	1371000	However,
1371000	1373000	when the Intragalepra
1373000	1375000	is very strong,
1375000	1377000	the big Praetor will be full.
1377000	1379000	As I said,
1379000	1381000	the big Praetor
1381000	1383000	will be full.
1383000	1385000	When I eat a certain amount of food,
1385000	1387000	I won't eat
1387000	1389000	more food
1389000	1391000	because I am full.
1391000	1393000	So, when the big Praetor
1393000	1395000	is full,
1395000	1397000	it doesn't eat bacteria.
1397000	1399000	It doesn't need to eat bacteria.
1399000	1401000	The small Intragalepra
1401000	1403000	is eaten by the big Praetor.
1403000	1405000	The small Praetor is getting smaller.
1405000	1407000	The big Praetor doesn't change much.
1407000	1409000	So,
1409000	1411000	when the two Praetors
1411000	1413000	are eating each other,
1413000	1415000	the bacteria are very happy
1415000	1417000	because no one eats them.
1417000	1419000	So, the biological mechanism
1419000	1421000	behind this
1421000	1423000	is like this.
1423000	1425000	Because
1425000	1427000	there is
1427000	1429000	a satiated
1429000	1431000	functional response,
1431000	1433000	we can see that
1433000	1435000	weak Intragalepra
1435000	1437000	will increase overall consumption
1437000	1439000	and decrease overall consumption.
1439000	1441000	That is to say, it will reduce
1441000	1443000	the basal resource density first and then increase.
1443000	1445000	This is
1445000	1447000	what the lab
1447000	1449000	and math tell us.
1449000	1451000	This thing may happen.
1451000	1453000	But
1453000	1455000	in the paper ice
1455000	1457000	and in the lab's
1457000	1459000	good and perfect environment,
1459000	1461000	will this result happen
1461000	1463000	in the wild?
1463000	1465000	Will you see
1465000	1467000	the positive impact of resource partitioning?
1467000	1469000	Intragalepra will be positive first.
1469000	1471000	When it is very weak, it is positive first.
1471000	1473000	Then negative again.
1473000	1475000	Will you see this?
1475000	1477000	So I
1477000	1479000	need to use
1479000	1481000	more real data
1481000	1483000	to do this reality check.
1483000	1485000	So what I want to check
1485000	1487000	is that I need to know
1487000	1489000	the resource consumption
1489000	1491000	or
1491000	1493000	resource community biomass
1493000	1495000	will it really decrease
1495000	1497000	with the increase of consumer diversity?
1497000	1499000	That is to say, when I have
1499000	1501000	a lot of different animals
1501000	1503000	or different kinds of consumers,
1503000	1505000	will they really eat more
1505000	1507000	of their prey?
1507000	1509000	Will this
1509000	1511000	impact
1511000	1513000	when these consumers
1513000	1515000	eat each other
1515000	1517000	not so seriously,
1517000	1519000	but not so seriously,
1519000	1521000	will this impact increase?
1521000	1523000	And when people eat each other
1523000	1525000	and it gets more and more exaggerated,
1525000	1527000	will this impact decrease?
1527000	1529000	This is what I want to test in the end.
1529000	1531000	You can't see this pattern in the wild.
1531000	1533000	So my
1533000	1535000	first method is
1535000	1537000	I went to
1537000	1539000	find a big
1539000	1541000	data set. This data set
1541000	1543000	is the EPA in the United States.
1543000	1545000	Every
1545000	1547000	five years,
1547000	1549000	they will
1549000	1551000	go to every lake in the United States,
1551000	1553000	every state, every place, every lake.
1553000	1555000	He went to do a sample.
1555000	1557000	Then
1557000	1559000	after choosing more than 1,000 lakes,
1559000	1561000	he will measure how many kinds of
1561000	1563000	phytoplankton in this lake,
1563000	1565000	which is the basic
1565000	1567000	resource in the lake.
1567000	1569000	They are food. How many
1569000	1571000	different kinds of phytoplankton do they have?
1571000	1573000	How many kinds of phytoplankton are there?
1573000	1575000	How much biomass is there in total?
1575000	1577000	Next is their
1577000	1579000	predator.
1579000	1581000	This is the first
1581000	1583000	consumer in the entire lake.
1583000	1585000	It will eat
1585000	1587000	those small creatures
1587000	1589000	like phytoplankton.
1589000	1591000	It will also measure
1591000	1593000	how many of them are
1593000	1595000	diverse in density.
1595000	1597000	Then
1597000	1599000	in this data set,
1599000	1601000	the only pity is
1601000	1603000	that he didn't really measure
1603000	1605000	whether the
1605000	1607000	omelette is strong or weak.
1607000	1609000	He didn't do an experiment
1609000	1611000	to measure how many
1611000	1613000	phytoplankton or how many small
1613000	1615000	consumers are eaten by large consumers.
1615000	1617000	He didn't measure this thing.
1617000	1619000	Because there are too many lakes, he can't do so many experiments.
1619000	1621000	But he reported that
1621000	1623000	he saw this phytoplankton,
1623000	1625000	this consumer,
1625000	1627000	it will eat other consumers
1627000	1629000	or not.
1629000	1631000	Is it vegetarian, meat-eating,
1631000	1633000	it is solid.
1633000	1635000	So I use
1635000	1637000	this low plankton community
1637000	1639000	how many are
1639000	1641000	omnivore
1641000	1643000	as a
1643000	1645000	degree of omnivore proxy.
1645000	1647000	This is not very good, but it is
1647000	1649000	in this data
1649000	1651000	you can get
1651000	1653000	evidence
1653000	1655000	information.
1655000	1657000	Then there are other
1657000	1659000	water temperature, pH,
1659000	1661000	electricity,
1661000	1663000	other data.
1663000	1665000	So after having this big data,
1665000	1667000	I will test
1667000	1669000	this hypothesis.
1669000	1671000	The first is to look at
1671000	1673000	the relationship between resource consumption and consumer diversity.
1673000	1675000	Will this relationship
1675000	1677000	increase or decrease
1677000	1679000	with the omnivore?
1681000	1683000	Before I actually did this experiment,
1683000	1685000	in fact, three years ago,
1685000	1687000	someone had used this data
1687000	1689000	to do a very preliminary
1689000	1691000	and basic analysis.
1691000	1693000	He just put the
1693000	1695000	resource community of biomass,
1695000	1697000	how many resources are there,
1697000	1699000	to return to other factors.
1699000	1701000	Then I found
1701000	1703000	how many kinds of
1703000	1705000	resource diversity
1705000	1707000	and the
1707000	1709000	egg and phosphorus in the lake.
1709000	1711000	These three are the most important
1711000	1713000	effects of phytoplankton
1713000	1715000	biomass.
1715000	1717000	However,
1717000	1719000	as I just said,
1719000	1721000	this data set
1721000	1723000	comes from the whole of the United States.
1723000	1725000	In other words,
1725000	1727000	the lake in California and the lake in Michigan
1727000	1729000	will definitely look different.
1729000	1731000	But when they did this analysis,
1731000	1733000	they did not consider this matter.
1733000	1735000	He treats everything as the same.
1735000	1737000	So what he wants to see is an overall overview.
1737000	1739000	So in fact, there are a lot of
1739000	1741000	biological interactions
1741000	1743000	in the middle that
1743000	1745000	will be ignored.
1745000	1747000	So to test this,
1747000	1749000	to do my analysis,
1749000	1751000	I have to make their analysis
1751000	1753000	more complicated.
1753000	1755000	The so-called more complicated
1755000	1757000	is the first one,
1757000	1759000	because these lakes belong to
1759000	1761000	different regions,
1761000	1763000	belong to different ecoregions.
1763000	1765000	Everyone can think of ecoregions as
1765000	1767000	different ecoregions,
1767000	1769000	it means that there are different
1769000	1771000	large-scale biological,
1771000	1773000	chemical, geological,
1773000	1775000	and water-temperature historical factors
1775000	1777000	that cause this lake to be
1777000	1779000	fundamentally different.
1779000	1781000	So my first step
1781000	1783000	is to make this model
1783000	1785000	more complicated.
1785000	1787000	I added special heterogeneity
1787000	1789000	to this model.
1789000	1791000	In other words,
1791000	1793000	the model just now
1793000	1795000	estimates only one effect,
1795000	1797000	that is,
1797000	1799000	biodiversity.
1799000	1801000	Only one value will affect
1801000	1803000	the community biomass.
1803000	1805000	But now I make this effect
1805000	1807000	depend on different ecoregions.
1807000	1809000	In other words, I can make it
1809000	1811000	have different effects
1811000	1813000	in different ecoregions.
1813000	1815000	So maybe in California,
1815000	1817000	this is very strong,
1817000	1819000	but in Michigan, this may be very low.
1819000	1821000	I consider this randomness.
1821000	1823000	This is the first
1823000	1825000	complexity.
1825000	1827000	The second is
1827000	1829000	I really want to test my prediction.
1829000	1831000	I added open-ended speech richness.
1833000	1835000	And I made this effect
1835000	1837000	depend on another variable.
1837000	1839000	In other words,
1839000	1841000	this is a general return,
1841000	1843000	y equals ax plus b.
1843000	1845000	I just need to look at
1845000	1847000	how big or how small ax's a is.
1847000	1849000	I know what the impact of x on y is.
1849000	1851000	This is the most basic return.
1851000	1853000	But I don't want it now.
1853000	1855000	Community biomass equals
1855000	1857000	a factor called beta
1857000	1859000	multiplied by
1859000	1861000	open-ended diversity.
1861000	1863000	But this beta is
1863000	1865000	another response variable.
1865000	1867000	So this is the second hierarchy.
1867000	1869000	In other words,
1869000	1871000	my model is
1871000	1873000	not a plane.
1873000	1875000	It has many layers.
1875000	1877000	When it becomes many layers,
1877000	1879000	the original analysis method
1879000	1881000	can't handle this complexity.
1881000	1883000	So what I have to do is
1883000	1885000	Bayesian hierarchical model.
1887000	1889000	I didn't go into too much detail
1889000	1891000	about how to do Bayesian.
1891000	1893000	In short,
1893000	1895000	what I want to answer is
1895000	1897000	even if I measure this big data,
1897000	1899000	when I see the probability of
1899000	1901000	this effect,
1901000	1903000	and when I see
1903000	1905000	the effect of one variable
1905000	1907000	on the other variable,
1907000	1909000	what is the probability?
1909000	1911000	The data
1911000	1913000	is like I just said,
1913000	1915000	it will be measured every five years.
1915000	1917000	The last two years are 2007 and 2012.
1917000	1919000	In 2007,
1919000	1921000	I did
1921000	1923000	a full model.
1923000	1925000	I will do some model selection
1925000	1927000	to remove this
1927000	1929000	to see if it has
1929000	1931000	a higher or lower
1931000	1933000	ability to explain this model.
1933000	1935000	Or the probability is higher or lower.
1935000	1937000	After doing the model selection,
1937000	1939000	finally,
1939000	1941000	in 2007,
1941000	1943000	the best model is
1943000	1945000	the three variables just now.
1945000	1947000	They are all selected.
1947000	1949000	Specialty, Trojanity
1949000	1951000	are very important.
1951000	1953000	Let these effects depend on
1953000	1955000	special ecoregion.
1955000	1957000	And I also chose
1957000	1959000	another variable.
1959000	1961000	This picture shows
1961000	1963000	the posterior I just mentioned.
1963000	1965000	Even this data,
1965000	1967000	I see
1967000	1969000	what is the probability
1969000	1971000	of the effect of this variable.
1971000	1973000	That is the posterior probability.
1973000	1975000	So we can see
1975000	1977000	the three most important variables
1977000	1979000	are still selected.
1979000	1981000	But these three variables
1981000	1983000	are not a value anymore.
1983000	1985000	They come from a distribution.
1985000	1987000	Give me an ecoregion,
1987000	1989000	I can tell you
1989000	1991000	what the effect of these three variables
1991000	1993000	in that ecoregion will be.
1993000	1995000	Then there is a
1995000	1997000	very awkward position,
1997000	1999000	which is
1999000	2001000	Zofan's Diversity.
2001000	2003000	It seems to be important,
2003000	2005000	but it doesn't seem to be.
2005000	2007000	If you add it in,
2007000	2009000	you can increase
2009000	2011000	the model's posterior probability.
2011000	2013000	You can also increase
2013000	2015000	the model's ability to explain
2015000	2017000	or even predict.
2017000	2019000	But its credible interval
2019000	2021000	overlaps with 0.
2021000	2023000	In terms of statistics,
2023000	2025000	this is the story of 2007.
2025000	2027000	But by 2012,
2027000	2029000	this model has changed.
2029000	2031000	This model adds
2031000	2033000	Zofan's Diversity.
2033000	2035000	Zofan's Diversity is
2035000	2037000	an important variable
2037000	2039000	in the data of 2002.
2039000	2041000	It can help explain
2041000	2043000	the variable of Zofan's Community.
2043000	2045000	And this effect depends on
2045000	2047000	Omnivory.
2047000	2049000	But there is another awkward situation.
2049000	2051000	Although it depends on Omnivory,
2051000	2053000	adding it in
2053000	2055000	is helpful to this model.
2055000	2057000	But the effect of Omnivory
2057000	2059000	cannot be detected.
2059000	2061000	Just like
2061000	2063000	the awkward effect of
2063000	2065000	Zofan in 2007.
2065000	2067000	Adding it in is useful,
2067000	2069000	but I can't know
2069000	2071000	how much it is.
2071000	2073000	But overall,
2073000	2075000	these three variables are the most important.
2075000	2077000	Adding Special Issue Genuity
2077000	2079000	is also very helpful to this model.
2079000	2081000	Hello.
2081000	2083000	Can you hear me?
2083000	2085000	Hello.
2085000	2087000	I missed the first five minutes.
2087000	2089000	Can we interrupt you
2089000	2091000	to ask a question?
2091000	2093000	Or do we have to ask at the end?
2093000	2095000	It's okay.
2095000	2097000	I have a question.
2097000	2099000	Because
2099000	2101000	these variables are
2101000	2103000	actually meaningful variables.
2103000	2105000	Like Total Nitrogen,
2105000	2107000	Total blah blah blah,
2107000	2109000	have you ever considered
2109000	2111000	combining these variables?
2111000	2113000	For example,
2113000	2115000	finding an eigenvalue
2115000	2117000	or linear combination.
2117000	2119000	Oh.
2119000	2121000	I can do that.
2121000	2123000	But if I
2123000	2125000	find its eigenvalue,
2125000	2127000	I will still lose
2127000	2129000	correlation.
2129000	2131000	Secondly,
2131000	2133000	the correlation between these variables
2133000	2135000	is not very big.
2135000	2137000	So I will just
2137000	2139000	treat each variable as an eigenvalue.
2139000	2141000	Oh.
2141000	2143000	Makes sense.
2143000	2145000	Yeah.
2145000	2147000	Nitrogen and Phosphorus.
2147000	2149000	This is a good question.
2149000	2151000	Nitrogen and Phosphorus
2151000	2153000	are highly correlated.
2153000	2155000	So in the model,
2155000	2157000	I let these two things
2157000	2159000	I put their covariance matrix
2159000	2161000	in the model,
2161000	2163000	but I didn't draw it directly.
2163000	2165000	Oh, I see. Thank you.
2165000	2167000	Hi.
2167000	2169000	Oh, I almost forgot.
2169000	2171000	So,
2171000	2173000	in 2007 and 2012,
2173000	2175000	in 2007 and 2012,
2175000	2177000	the models we saw
2177000	2179000	were different.
2179000	2181000	Given 2007 and given 2012,
2181000	2183000	the most likely
2183000	2185000	explanation of these data
2185000	2187000	was different.
2187000	2189000	As time goes by,
2189000	2191000	I might see that
2191000	2193000	these variables are not important.
2193000	2195000	But how did they change?
2195000	2197000	Even this data,
2197000	2199000	because I only have two
2199000	2201000	snapshots,
2201000	2203000	and they are so far apart.
2203000	2205000	I don't know how they changed.
2205000	2207000	But there is one thing
2207000	2209000	I can point out.
2209000	2211000	In 2007,
2211000	2213000	the local diversity
2213000	2215000	was awkward.
2215000	2217000	It was on the edge.
2217000	2219000	But in 2012,
2219000	2221000	it was really
2221000	2223000	different from 0.
2223000	2225000	So,
2225000	2227000	when I dug up
2227000	2229000	these raw data,
2229000	2231000	I found that in 2012,
2231000	2233000	on average,
2233000	2235000	every lake had 8 different
2235000	2237000	low content.
2237000	2239000	Compared to 2007,
2239000	2241000	I don't know how this happened.
2241000	2243000	But if this happened,
2243000	2245000	it means that in 2012,
2245000	2247000	in recent years,
2247000	2249000	there are more animals
2249000	2251000	moving around.
2251000	2253000	With more animals,
2253000	2255000	it's easier to see that
2255000	2257000	different animals eat different foods.
2257000	2259000	Or they have a different impact
2259000	2261000	on the biomass of low content.
2261000	2263000	For example,
2263000	2265000	the effect of this variable
2265000	2267000	is easier to detect.
2267000	2269000	But in 2012,
2269000	2271000	in 2007 and 2012,
2271000	2273000	I can explain that
2273000	2275000	low content diversity
2275000	2277000	can be detected.
2277000	2279000	But other variables,
2279000	2281000	like Omnivore,
2281000	2283000	why it wasn't detected
2283000	2285000	in 2007 and 2012,
2285000	2287000	I don't really understand.
2287000	2289000	They are basically the same.
2289000	2291000	A lot of Omnivores are the same.
2291000	2293000	But in 2012,
2293000	2295000	it was detected.
2295000	2297000	In 2007, it wasn't.
2297000	2299000	Given this data,
2299000	2301000	I can't answer this question.
2301000	2303000	Lastly,
2303000	2305000	this is
2305000	2307000	the biggest problem
2307000	2309000	of Shrubster.
2309000	2311000	As I said,
2311000	2313000	the degree of Omnivore
2313000	2315000	is not measured.
2315000	2317000	It doesn't measure how many small animals
2317000	2319000	are eaten,
2319000	2321000	or how many overboars
2321000	2323000	are eaten by
2323000	2325000	plants and animals.
2325000	2327000	It's not measured.
2327000	2329000	It's a proxy.
2329000	2331000	It's hard to verify
2331000	2333000	because
2333000	2335000	it's a proxy.
2335000	2337000	I can't detect
2337000	2339000	the Omnivore.
2339000	2341000	Maybe it's because
2341000	2343000	Omnivore is too
2343000	2345000	unimportant.
2345000	2347000	Only in math,
2347000	2349000	or in a
2349000	2351000	well-controlled environment,
2351000	2353000	I can see this effect.
2353000	2355000	So when I go out,
2355000	2357000	it's not important.
2357000	2359000	It won't happen.
2359000	2361000	My PhD will know what I'm doing.
2361000	2363000	It's a sad
2363000	2365000	conclusion.
2365000	2367000	However,
2367000	2369000	to solve the Omnivore
2369000	2371000	consumption problem,
2371000	2373000	I have another
2373000	2375000	experiment.
2375000	2377000	I go to the lake
2377000	2379000	to get water
2379000	2381000	to feed these animals.
2381000	2383000	I measure
2383000	2385000	how many phytoplankton
2385000	2387000	are eaten by
2387000	2389000	small animals
2389000	2391000	and how many by large animals.
2391000	2393000	Overall,
2393000	2395000	how many phytoplankton
2395000	2397000	are eaten.
2397000	2399000	I can measure
2399000	2401000	the consumption
2401000	2403000	of phytoplankton.
2403000	2405000	It's the most important
2405000	2407000	response variable.
2407000	2409000	How is it affected by
2409000	2411000	zooplankton diversity?
2411000	2413000	How is this effect
2413000	2415000	strengthened by Omnivore?
2415000	2417000	In the experiment,
2417000	2419000	I measured
2419000	2421000	these things.
2421000	2423000	However,
2423000	2425000	it took too much energy.
2425000	2427000	I can only get
2427000	2429000	30 points.
2429000	2431000	I spent two summers
2431000	2433000	to get 30 points.
2433000	2435000	Let me show you
2435000	2437000	my experiment.
2437000	2439000	I
2439000	2441000	put a
2441000	2443000	boat on the
2443000	2445000	lake.
2445000	2447000	I drove the boat to the lake
2447000	2449000	to get water.
2449000	2451000	After I got water,
2451000	2453000	I put it back in the bottle.
2453000	2455000	There are animals
2455000	2457000	and plants in the bottle.
2457000	2459000	I left it in the lake
2459000	2461000	for a day.
2461000	2463000	I checked
2463000	2465000	how many animals and plants
2465000	2467000	disappeared.
2467000	2469000	However,
2469000	2471000	the first result
2471000	2473000	disappeared.
2473000	2475000	So I skipped it.
2475000	2477000	I can
2477000	2479000	share the results
2479000	2481000	with you later.
2481000	2483000	Let me show you
2483000	2485000	the animals
2485000	2487000	in the experiment.
2487000	2489000	Microzooplankton
2489000	2491000	look like
2491000	2493000	dinoflagellates.
2493000	2495000	There are also
2495000	2497000	small ciliates
2497000	2499000	in the experiment.
2499000	2501000	There are also large ciliates.
2503000	2505000	That's all for today.
2505000	2507000	In theory,
2507000	2509000	this experiment
2509000	2511000	is promising.
2511000	2513000	However, it is too labor intensive.
2513000	2515000	I can't
2515000	2517000	get a good result
2517000	2519000	from this experiment.
2519000	2521000	The sample size is too small.
2521000	2523000	I skip
2523000	2525000	the experiment result.
2525000	2527000	I will share
2527000	2529000	the results with you later.
2529000	2531000	Thank you
2531000	2533000	for your attention.
2533000	2535000	I will leave
2535000	2537000	my email address
2537000	2539000	at the end of the video.
2539000	2541000	If you have any questions
2541000	2543000	or suggestions,
2543000	2545000	please
2545000	2547000	leave a message.
2547000	2549000	Thank you.
2549000	2551000	Thank you.
2551000	2553000	Thank you.
2553000	2555000	Thank you,
2555000	2557000	for the wonderful
2557000	2559000	presentation.
2559000	2561000	Let's see if anyone
2561000	2563000	has any questions
2563000	2565000	about
2565000	2567000	Microzooplankton.
2571000	2573000	Let me ask a
2573000	2575000	naive question.
2575000	2577000	All your research
2577000	2579000	focuses on
2579000	2581000	phytoplankton
2581000	2583000	and zooplankton.
2583000	2585000	Can zooplankton
2585000	2587000	be applied
2587000	2589000	to larger
2589000	2591000	subspecies?
2593000	2595000	Large subspecies
2595000	2597000	are fine.
2599000	2601000	I can't
2601000	2603000	answer
2603000	2605000	this question
2605000	2607000	confidently.
2607000	2609000	I can't scale up
2609000	2611000	to larger animals.
2611000	2613000	It's complicated.
2613000	2615000	For example,
2615000	2617000	humans or
2617000	2619000	cats and dogs
2619000	2621000	are harder to
2621000	2623000	quantify
2623000	2625000	than
2625000	2627000	small animals.
2627000	2629000	It's hard to
2629000	2631000	systematically collect
2631000	2633000	data.
2633000	2635000	I'm not sure
2635000	2637000	if I can
2637000	2639000	scale up to
2639000	2641000	large animals.
2641000	2643000	If there's a system
2643000	2645000	that can measure
2645000	2647000	zooplankton and
2647000	2649000	consumer diversity,
2649000	2651000	this system
2651000	2653000	can be applied
2653000	2655000	to my framework
2655000	2657000	to see if
2657000	2659000	different systems
2659000	2661000	have different
2661000	2663000	effects.
2663000	2665000	Let me follow up
2665000	2667000	with a question.
2667000	2669000	Zooplankton
2669000	2671000	doesn't look
2671000	2673000	complicated.
2673000	2675000	It's just
2675000	2677000	eating and being eaten.
2677000	2679000	I'm thinking
2679000	2681000	that
2681000	2683000	when zooplankton
2683000	2685000	eats
2685000	2687000	phytoplankton
2687000	2689000	and is
2689000	2691000	being eaten,
2691000	2693000	doesn't it have
2693000	2695000	mechanisms
2695000	2697000	that make
2697000	2699000	zooplankton
2699000	2701000	eat phytoplankton?
2701000	2703000	I'm not sure
2703000	2705000	if I can
2705000	2707000	scale up to
2707000	2709000	large animals.
2709000	2711000	I'm not sure
2711000	2713000	if I can
2713000	2715000	scale up to
2715000	2717000	zooplankton
2717000	2719000	and eat
2719000	2721000	phytoplankton.
2721000	2723000	I'm not sure
2723000	2725000	if I can
2725000	2727000	scale up to
2727000	2729000	large animals.
2729000	2731000	I'm not sure
2731000	2733000	if I can
2733000	2735000	scale up to
2735000	2737000	zooplankton
2737000	2739000	and eat
2739000	2741000	phytoplankton.
2741000	2743000	I'm not sure
2743000	2745000	if I can
2745000	2747000	scale up to
2747000	2749000	large animals.
2749000	2751000	I'm not sure
2751000	2753000	if I can
2753000	2755000	scale up to
2755000	2757000	zooplankton
2757000	2759000	and eat
2759000	2761000	phytoplankton.
2761000	2763000	I'm not sure
2763000	2765000	if I can
2765000	2767000	scale up to
2767000	2769000	large animals.
2769000	2771000	I'm not sure
2771000	2773000	if I can
2773000	2775000	scale up to
2775000	2777000	large animals.
2777000	2779000	I'm not sure
2779000	2781000	if I can
2781000	2783000	scale up to
2783000	2785000	large animals.
2785000	2787000	And if I can
2787000	2789000	scale up to
2789000	2791000	a whole family.
2791000	2793000	If I can
2793000	2795000	scale up to
2795000	2797000	a whole family.
2797000	2799000	And if I can
2799000	2801000	scale up to
2801000	2803000	a whole family.
2803000	2805000	Because I'm not sure
2805000	2807000	if I can
2807000	2809000	scale up to
2809000	2811000	a whole family.
2811000	2813000	Because I'm not sure
2813000	2815000	if I can scale up
2815000	2817000	to a whole family.
2817000	2819000	Maybe the analysis
2819000	2821000	can help someone.
2821000	2823000	Maybe the analysis
2823000	2825000	can help someone.
2825000	2827000	Because
2827000	2829000	I live in a small nature.
2829000	2831000	And my house
2831000	2832360	has withrawn
2832360	2834000	years ago.
2834000	2836000	So if
2836000	2838000	I do the analysis
2838000	2840000	I can scale up
2840000	2842000	to a whole family.
2842000	2844000	For example,
2844000	2846000	a pond can count
2846000	2848000	tens of thousands
2848000	2850000	of plants.
2850000	2852000	tens of thousands
2852000	2854000	of individuals.
2854000	2856000	And animals
2856000	2858000	can count hundreds of thousands of individuals.
2858000	2860000	So the distribution
2860000	2862000	of variables
2862000	2864000	is actually
2864000	2866000	systematically dominant
2866000	2868000	but not statistically dominant.
2868000	2870000	Statistically uncertainty dominant.
2870000	2872000	I think so.
2874000	2876000	I don't understand
2876000	2878000	what you mean.
2878000	2880000	What I mean is
2880000	2882000	the number of
2882000	2884000	animals you count
2884000	2886000	is so large
2886000	2888000	that
2888000	2890000	there is no calculation
2890000	2892000	error.
2892000	2894000	The distribution width
2894000	2896000	mainly comes from
2896000	2898000	the difference in region
2898000	2900000	and year, right?
2900000	2902000	Yes.
2902000	2904000	We believe so.
2904000	2906000	For example,
2906000	2908000	the species
2908000	2910000	of phytoplankton.
2910000	2912000	I do one thing.
2912000	2914000	I verify
2914000	2916000	the species
2916000	2918000	of phytoplankton.
2918000	2920000	How to say?
2920000	2922000	I don't count
2922000	2924000	the number of species.
2924000	2926000	I consider
2926000	2928000	all samples
2928000	2930000	given sampling effort.
2930000	2932000	I can draw a curve.
2932000	2934000	Sampling effort
2934000	2936000	is x-axis.
2936000	2938000	Y-axis is species richness.
2938000	2940000	Given a sampling effort,
2940000	2942000	I can estimate
2942000	2944000	how many species
2944000	2946000	the sampling effort should have.
2946000	2948000	This curve
2948000	2950000	is calculated
2950000	2952000	from all data.
2954000	2956000	So
2956000	2958000	I assume
2958000	2960000	my sampling is
2960000	2962000	representative
2962000	2964000	to that lake.
2964000	2966000	I can't verify this.
2966000	2968000	But I count a lot.
2968000	2970000	This assumption should be possible.
2970000	2972000	I also consider
2972000	2974000	the sampling effort.
2974000	2976000	I don't count
2976000	2978000	the number of species.
2980000	2982000	I count a lot
2982000	2984000	and get a lot of species.
2984000	2986000	I count a little and get a little species.
2988000	2990000	I see.
2992000	2994000	Thank you.
2994000	2996000	Let me explain
2996000	2998000	why I ask this question.
2998000	3000000	A while ago,
3000000	3002000	I went to see
3002000	3004000	a group of researchers.
3004000	3006000	They were doing
3006000	3008000	microscopic sampling.
3008000	3010000	They said
3010000	3012000	it was hard
3012000	3014000	to calculate
3014000	3016000	the number of species
3016000	3018000	with human eyes.
3018000	3020000	If you know
3020000	3022000	the statistical error,
3022000	3024000	you can calculate
3024000	3026000	the number of species.
3026000	3028000	They developed a
3028000	3030000	video recognition method
3030000	3032000	to calculate
3032000	3034000	the number of species.
3034000	3036000	They immediately reduced
3036000	3038000	the error.
3038000	3040000	I was wondering
3040000	3042000	if you could apply this technology.
3042000	3044000	You said you counted
3044000	3046000	tens of thousands of species.
3046000	3048000	The statistical error of tens of thousands
3048000	3050000	is about 1%.
3050000	3052000	The width of the distribution
3052000	3054000	is more than 1%.
3054000	3056000	This means
3056000	3058000	the dominant bias
3058000	3060000	is different by region
3060000	3062000	and year.
3062000	3064000	It doesn't help you much.
3064000	3066000	I was wondering
3066000	3068000	if we could apply
3068000	3070000	a better method
3070000	3072000	of sampling.
3072000	3074000	You said
3074000	3076000	this method
3076000	3078000	was like
3078000	3080000	a machine
3080000	3082000	doing it for me.
3082000	3084000	If I look at it
3084000	3086000	with my eyes,
3086000	3088000	I need to look at
3088000	3090000	1 liter of water.
3092000	3094000	But this machine
3094000	3096000	is like a microscope
3096000	3098000	taking photos of me.
3098000	3100000	It keeps taking photos.
3100000	3102000	I can adjust the flow rate
3102000	3104000	and how fast or slow it is.
3104000	3106000	It's a bit like
3106000	3108000	the technique you mentioned.
3108000	3110000	This software is a bit like
3110000	3112000	the technique you mentioned.
3112000	3114000	It helps me expand my sample size.
3114000	3116000	Okay.
3116000	3118000	That makes sense.
3118000	3120000	The problem I encountered
3120000	3122000	in this field
3122000	3124000	is that
3124000	3126000	I can build
3126000	3128000	these curves
3128000	3130000	and detect these signals.
3130000	3132000	I have more than 1,000 data.
3132000	3134000	But when I
3134000	3136000	need to measure these feeding needs,
3136000	3138000	because I'm alone,
3138000	3140000	I can only measure
3140000	3142000	up to 40 data points.
3142000	3144000	The problem I encountered
3144000	3146000	is that the machine exists,
3146000	3148000	but the distribution
3148000	3150000	is zero.
3150000	3152000	So
3152000	3154000	it's a lot of trouble.
3154000	3156000	I see. So you really need
3156000	3158000	a lot of statistics.
3158000	3160000	I'm willing to
3160000	3162000	do research
3162000	3164000	in the wild.
3164000	3166000	I see. Thank you.
3166000	3168000	Thank you.
3168000	3170000	Any other
3170000	3172000	questions?
3178000	3180000	If not,
3180000	3182000	let's give a round of applause
3182000	3184000	to thank Zhang Fengxun
3184000	3186000	for his wonderful presentation.
3186000	3188000	Thank you.
3188000	3190000	Thank you, everyone.
3190000	3192000	This is the end of
3192000	3194000	the webinar.
3194000	3196000	The video will be uploaded
3196000	3198000	next week.
3198000	3200000	If you are interested
3200000	3202000	in more details,
3202000	3204000	or would like to contact
3204000	3206000	Zhang Fengxun
3206000	3208000	for a more in-depth discussion,
3208000	3210000	please do so.
3210000	3212000	Thank you.
