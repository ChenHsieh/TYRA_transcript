00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TerraTalk.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
We are very honored to have Wang Chenghe in Germany to give us a speech.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
The topic of today's speech is Coupling Cell-Cell Adhesion to Cell Polarization.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
It is mainly a research on biophysics.

00:24.000 --> 00:36.000
First, let me introduce our speaker today.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Our speaker today is Wang Chenghe.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
He is currently in Germany.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
He graduated from the University of Taiwan Institute of Technology.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
When he was a master's thesis, he did a preliminary personalized breast cancer drug test.

00:49.000 --> 00:57.000
After graduation, he served in Taiwan for three years in the light company.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
The main thing is to do 3D laser imaging development.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
After graduation, he did a measurement study of cell grafting in the Institute of Medical Sciences.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Then, from his previous field in the Institute of Medical Sciences, he switched to the field of biophysics.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
Currently, he is a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute of Cell Biology and Genetics in Germany.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
What he is studying now is what he is going to tell us today.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
It is the early cell-cell adhesion study of cell polarization.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
We remind everyone that we have to turn on the microphone to applaud our speaker.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Let's applaud to welcome our speaker.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Thank you all. Please start.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Thank you all.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
I just introduced myself. I am Wang Chenghe.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I am now in the third year of my doctoral studies.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
I am going to share with you my research in the past three years.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
If you have any questions later, you can interrupt me.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
You can interrupt me and ask questions directly.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
We can discuss at the same time.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
If you have any questions, please say a phrase first.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Then ask your question.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Otherwise, I may continue to talk at once.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Because there is a lag, I am afraid that this will be interfered with.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I am currently a doctoral student in Germany.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
My research is actually looking at the connection between cells and the relationship between cell polarization.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
This is a very big topic.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I don't know what the background is today.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So I prepared a simple general introduction.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
The main thing is to connect cells.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
You should know that we have learned from high school students that cells are composed of organs.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
So cells have a regular arrangement in the animal body.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
It can be arranged into different organs or organs with different functions.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
One of the organs is called the epithelium.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
In Chinese, it is the upper arm cell.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
It basically consists of cells in the animal body.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
It is a cell organ that surrounds these cells.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
For example, like your kidney or your stomach.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
These cells will have such a cell on top.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
As you can see, this is my mouse.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
It doesn't matter.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Anyway, one of the features of this cell is that when it forms a cell,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
it is mainly a simple single cell.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Then go around this cell to form such a structure.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
You can see that the lower right corner is a multi-layer cell.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
But most of them are actually single cells that form such a structure.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Why does this cell form such a structure?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
And what mechanism do they have?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
In fact, this has been studied for a very, very long time.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
Such a single cell is connected to a single cell.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
They actually have some common features to share.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
One of the features is that there is a tree on top of it.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
It is an epithelial membrane that does not connect to anything.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
We call it epithelial membrane.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
There is nothing on this cell.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It can be said that there is no contact with any cell

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
or this kind of epithelial membrane.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It is epithelial membrane.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Then there will be some connections between cells.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Because you know that these cells are linked together.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So it is very intuitive to think that they form a connection.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
This connection is what we call a lateral membrane.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
The third membrane is the basal membrane.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
The basal membrane is the membrane that the cell connects to the external environment,

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
the ECM, or the reflection environment of the cell.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Basal membrane.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
So there are only three main membranes in this cell.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Everyone is very curious about how the cell controls each cell

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
so that these three membranes can be placed well

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
and form a connection at the same time.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Then it will not form a strange shape,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
but a slightly organized shape.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
So this matter, whether in biophysics or biophysics,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
is actually a problem that has been studied for a very long time.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
To do this kind of research, you can use a lot of different materials.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You can do mouse experiments.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
You can do things.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
You can do anything.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You can do cell lines.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Like me, I focus on using cell lines.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So I don't do animal experiments.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
The cell line I use is a cell called MDCK.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
MDCK cells are mainly...

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
The origin of MDCK cells is the sacral tube of the dog.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
So it will form a wall.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
It will form a tube.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Let's say a tube.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
But in fact, in a lot of research, it just forms a sphere.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
OK, anyway, I don't care.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Our study model,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
it looks for two cells from one cell.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Everyone knows the cell division.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
After the division, it will form a cell-cell connection at the beginning.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Let me find a reference here.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Its label is green.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
The green part is the connection between two cells.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
The two blue ones are the two cell boxes.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
OK, and then it continues to grow.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
After it continues to grow, it will form the one on the far right.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
The one you see now.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Blue is still a cell box.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Green is the connection between cells.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
This is a plane.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
What you see now is a sphere.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
The red one is what I just said.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
The place in the middle of the box.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
It's a lumen.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
It's a lumen with all kinds of liquid and all kinds of nutrients in it.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
A box with all kinds of molecules in it.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
It's a lumen.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Then the cells form a single cell connection structure like this.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Then wrap the lumen in the middle.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
We call it cyst.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
If you have ever studied MDCK culture,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
you will know that if you put it in an environment where there are no cells,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
it will grow like this.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
OK.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
If you remember what I just said,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Epico, Lateral and Basal,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
three different membranes.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
In more detail,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
these three membranes are actually filled with different molecules.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Whether it's liquid or protein.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
But what I'm talking about here is protein.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Protein on the membrane.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
In Epico,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I've listed two types here.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
One is called protocollicin or CrOMS.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
You don't have to remember these names.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
But in Epico,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
please remember protocollicin first.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
This protein.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Because I will use this protein in the next experiment.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
To represent whether the cells have grown Epico membranes.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
This thing.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Then there's Basal.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Indicator.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It's like the corner of a cell.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
It will form a connection with the nucleus of the cell.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I didn't do too much of Basal.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I did it more in the previous lab.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But I'm not focusing on this now.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
So I won't cover it here today.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Then there are cells.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
It's like my title today.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Cellular adhesions.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
Cellular adhesions have a lot of different types.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
We call it adhesion receptor.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
You can think of it as a plug.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Protein is like a plug.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
It will connect.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
It will form a cell-cell connection.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
There are four types here.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I only listed about four types.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
In fact, it can be roughly divided into orange and red.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Two are a kind.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
It's a kind.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Then the blue and green below are another kind.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
You just have to remember the green one.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
E-cadherin.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Because I will use E-cadherin to represent the next experiment.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Lateral adhesions between cell membranes.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
So anyway.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
In short, these three domains are defined by these different protein distributions.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
In past research, many people have removed these different proteins.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
If you are not a biological background,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Protein's performance is removed in this cell.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
It doesn't produce this protein.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Then look at what impact it has on the entire structure.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Pay attention to the sphere structure in the upper right corner.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
It's a normal structure.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
If you remove any protein, it doesn't produce that structure.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
It means that the polarization of this cell is affected.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
So after removing some proteins, you will see that it produces more than one lumen.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
It means that the mechanism of the epico-membrane is affected.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Or more seriously,

09:10.000 --> 09:18.000
Other influences may cause it to grow into a sphere.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Or grow into a very large cluster, like a tumor.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
So after removing a protein,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
What is the final result?

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
In fact, a lot of papers have already started to study this.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
A lot of papers have been doing this since 2000.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
But what we want to end up in this study is the process.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
That is, in the entire dynamics, from one cell to this multi-cell process.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
How are these proteins affected by each other?

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
And when are these proteins produced?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
And where are they?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And when is it important?

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
It's important for the whole thing to grow into a normal shape.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
This is what I'm mainly doing.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
If you look at the three pictures above me,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
You will find that the process is actually very simple.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
The cells are divided into two cells.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
The two cells continue to separate and separate.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Finally, it grows into such a spherical structure.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
But you can notice one thing.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
The red epico here is the domain of the epico.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
It's actually not in the final right.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
It was produced under the multi-cell situation on the right.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It was already produced when there were two cells.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
In the middle of the two cells,

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
You can say that it is almost in the middle of the domain where the two cells are connected.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Just produced this epico domain.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
This epico domain is produced in such an early state.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
So we are very curious about how the mechanism tells the cell

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
You have to throw your epico domain there.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Instead of throwing it somewhere else.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So we are curious about this.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
In addition,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
It's not actually split into two from one.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It will form this domain.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
This is from my own data.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You put the two cells together.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Then after a long time, it will eventually form this epico domain.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
The red part is the epico domain.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
The green part is the same as above.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It's the adhesion of the two cells.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
So we have an intuitive idea.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Will it be when the two cells are connected?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
These proteins.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I just marked four next to it.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
One of them tells the cell that

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
OK, I have a neighbor next to me.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I now have this neighbor.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
So I have to produce an epico membrane between me and my neighbor.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
So we came up with a project at the beginning.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
It's very intuitive.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Since it's two cells,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Which one do we want to see?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Protein

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Cells connect to proteins.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
It's dominated by this thing.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
So let's get rid of a cell.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
It's like hitting a single cell.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Let's do this.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
Then we replace one of the cells with a supported lipid bilayer.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It's a lipid bilayer.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You know from the name.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
It's a double-layered membrane.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
We put different receptors on this membrane.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Lateral adhesion receptor.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Put it on this membrane.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Then we can see what kind of reaction the cell will have to which type.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
So after we drop the cell,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Let's look at the interaction between it and the receptor below.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
This receptor is on the membrane.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
One of the benefits of the supported lipid bilayer above is

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
If you only have a fixed situation,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Cell adhesion is dead.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
It can't self-organize.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
It can't do what it wants to do.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So if we put it on the lipid bilayer,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It can move freely.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
So after the cell goes down,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
It can depend on its own

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Whether it's its own internal mechanics

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Or its own chemical reaction

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Will produce the same result.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Ideally, we can find

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Some kind of receptor

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
That can activate the epico-domain

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Between the cells.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
But unfortunately,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
The cells don't like this environment.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
So I spent a year and a half doing this.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
The cells actually ate it.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
This research is actually quite useful.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Because it purifies a lot of different proteins.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
We tried to do this experiment.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
But the cells don't like it.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
But that doesn't mean this method won't work.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
It's just that we may need a very long time at this stage.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
So I gave up this method.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And I didn't do it in this direction.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I started to do this experiment

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
In a situation that wasn't so ambitious.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
So we went back to the state of two cells.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
We don't have to do bilayer.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
We just observe these two cells.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
What must be missing in the middle?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
We didn't notice.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Because the cells don't like the receptor.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And the cells will die.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And the epico-domain won't be produced.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
So we went back to the literature.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
To see how it goes from one cell to two cells.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
The first process is cell division.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
In the last step of cell division,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Cut the two cells apart.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
There is a step called cytokinesis.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Those of you who studied cell biology should know.

14:24.000 --> 14:32.000
Cytokinesis is a very strong cytoskeletal force.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
It's like a circular scissor.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Cut the link between the two cells.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
After the cut,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
If a cell doesn't form a link,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
It will form two independent cells.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
But what we see now is the epithelial cell.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Two cells will form a link.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
So it's not completely cut off.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
At the same time, it forms a link.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
When it forms a link,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I forgot to say one thing.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Before it's cut off,

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
There will be a tubulin between the two cells.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Tubulin is also a cytoskeleton.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
It's a kind of bridge.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
A track.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
It will stay there.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
We call it the midbody.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
This midbody will remain in the entire cell division.

15:19.000 --> 15:31.000
The midbody is the place where the epithelial domain is generated.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Next, there will be vesicles.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
These vesicles carry the proteins that form the epithelial membrane.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Or lipids.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
The proteins will be transported to this place.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
After the transportation,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
These proteins are fused to the middle.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
After being fused,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
It will expand more and more.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
These epithelial domains are connected.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
But the proteins in the epithelial domain

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
don't form a link.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So we thought that

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
they will form a repulsive force.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And gradually expand.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
This process has been studied by many people.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Many people already know

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
what kind of proteins are important for this delivery.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
What can we do?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
We care about the selection of cells.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
So we think that the connection between cells

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
should be interplayed with delivery.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
So the first thing we suspect is

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
the important selection of the epithelial membrane.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
We think it's high junction.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
OK, I haven't said what high junction is.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
High junction is the picture on the right.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It's a small T-J.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
So if you look at the picture on the right,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
If you think of it as 3D,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
The entire lumen is a sphere.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
The T-J high junction is like a round ring.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Then this sphere,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
You can think of it as a channel.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
It's like a channel of this lumen.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Seal this lumen.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
So we think that

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
This high junction has always been

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
This lumen and its lateral adhesion

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
The interface between its cellular connections.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
So we think it has something to do with

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
the production of the entire epithelial membrane.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So the next question is

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I have a question.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
How fast is the time scale of this whole process?

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
OK, so from the leftmost cell division

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Then to the rightmost one, it's about 6 hours.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
5 to 6 hours.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
5 to 6 hours.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
Is it about the same time for each step?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Or which one is particularly long?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Which one is particularly long?

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
From the four schematics I drew below

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I took four schematics.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
The one on the right and the one on the left

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
It's about four hours apart.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
You mean the last arrow, right?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Yes, so it's from the first schematic to the third.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Maybe only one hour in the middle.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Oh, I see.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
But the last one takes several hours.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I see. OK.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
OK, thank you.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
So we're curious about

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
When was this high junction produced?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Let me introduce it to you today.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
What is high junction?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
If you remember, I just talked about epico, lateral, and basal.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Three domains.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
In fact, there is a red band in the middle.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I didn't introduce it.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That's high junction.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
It's in the interface between epico and lateral membrane.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And it will always exist in that place.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
The main protein group

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
There are actually a lot of high junction protein groups.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Basically, what I drew here

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
The red, blue, and purple on the schematic.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
The three are its receptors.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
The main ones are occluden, occluden, and GEMS.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Of course, occluden has a lot of kinds of occluden.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Occluden has a lot of kinds of occluden.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
GEMS has a lot of kinds.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
So it's not just a protein.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
It has a lot of kinds.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
On the inside of the cell

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
You can see that there is a yellow, orange, and green.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Three proteins.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It's actually a high junction.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
It's connected to the inside of the cell.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It's not directly connected to other cells.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
But it's connected to occluden, GEMS, and occluden.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
This picture is a bit misleading.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I haven't found a better one yet.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm sorry.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It doesn't mean that ZO1 is based on occluden.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
ZO2 is based on occluden.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
ZO3 is based on GEMS.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
The three are actually mixed together.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
In my understanding.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It's not just based on one kind.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
ZO1 can be based on three proteins.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Anyway, it's a mixed state here.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
I hope everyone can remember ZO1 protein.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Because ZO1 protein is a very important protein in my next experiment.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
There has been research to prove that.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Obviously, after you remove ZO1 and ZO2.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
After the cells do not produce these two proteins.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
The high junction between the cells will not be produced.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
This is very important to my experiment.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Everyone remember this first.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Its main function is high junction.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
So, as the name suggests, it's very tight.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
So, it's the closest link between cells.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
It's a close connection.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
It's like the whole cell connection is sealed together.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
So, you can imagine that the entire lumen can be considered to be sealed by this high junction.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
So, we think that whether there is a high junction to produce lumen.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It will definitely have a relationship.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
So, let's start the next experiment.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
OK.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
What I want to say here is.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I just talked about high junction.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
And epical membrane.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
What is the situation in the middle?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
How is it produced?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Why can the high junction be produced in the middle?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
So, I just went back to the schematic I just mentioned.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
From cell division to lumen.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
The color is a bit messy here.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Sorry, I have a lot of slimes here.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
OK.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The red one represents the cytokinesis I just mentioned.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Contractile ring.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It's like a knife.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Cut the two cells apart.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
The green one is the high junction I just mentioned.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It will form the lumen.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
In the reference diagram.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
The small schematic with the high junction.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It's a half-circle.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
A diagram.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
So, the blue high junction is a cell.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
The blue low junction is a cell.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
The red one is the protein representing the red circle.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
The red one is the protein representing the red circle.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
The protein slowly cuts into the cell membrane.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
The protein slowly cuts into the cell membrane.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Cut the cells apart.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
At the same time.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
It will put the later adhesions.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Remember the protein eCathctors and eHearing.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It will carry these two cells.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
It will carry these two cells.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
It's a gap now that puts the later adhesions.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
It will ahead of itself.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Like I said before,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
there's a mid-body.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
A right center.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
There's a tubulin.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.000


22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
creating the later adhesion.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
So the mid-body is important.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
So the mid-body is important.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
But the mid-body will be cut off.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
But the mid-body will be cut off.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Because the two cells need to be completely separated.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So there must be a point

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
So there must be a point

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
for the later adhesion to stop.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
We think that's what Pythagoras is doing.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Pythagoras stops

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
near the mid-body

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
so that the later adhesion

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
won't directly invade

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
the area between the cells.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
We want to leave this gap

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
so that the apical membrane can be created.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
This is one of our assumptions.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
The reason why I say this

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
is because we observe

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
the cytokinesis

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
in the process of cell separation.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The high junction and

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
the later adhesion,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
both exist at the same time

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
as the cytokinesis ring.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
as the cytokinesis ring.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
As you can see here,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
you can imagine

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
the cytokinesis cell

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
is behind the screen.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
So you can see the interface

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
between the two cells.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
There is such a large actin,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
the cytokinesis countertowel ring.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It separates the two cells.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
At the same time, you can see

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
the ZO1 and E-cadherin,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
these two proteins,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
are wrapped inside

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
the large countertowel ring

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
or collocalized.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
So when we see this,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
the ZO1 is squeezed

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
in the middle.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
The E-cadherin

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
has its mechanism

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
to keep it outside.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
The good later adhesion

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
also keeps the ZO1

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
which is the place

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
where the next ethical membrane

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
is going to be created.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
At the same time,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
we want to know

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
if there is no ZO1,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
is there no

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
E-cadherin,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
then we will

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
remove the ZO1 and ZO2

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
proteins inside the cell.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So here you can see

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
a cross-section

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
of the entire cyst.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
So the wild type on the left,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
the black hole in the middle

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
is the lumen.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The E-cadherin,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
the lumen in the middle

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
is very spherical.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
After the ZO1 and ZO2

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
are removed,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
there is still a small lumen in the middle.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
At first, we thought

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
there was still a lumen after the ZO1 and ZO2 were removed.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Maybe it has nothing to do

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
with the lumen.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
At the same time,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
if we carefully draw

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
the lumen contour,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
believe me,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
it will look like this.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
We think it is

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
a flower-shaped lumen.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Based on this,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
we think

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
whether the lumen

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
has something to do

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
with the E-cadherin.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
The E-cadherin

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
may not have anything to do

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
with the E-cadherin.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
But whether the lumen

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
can grow into a sphere

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
may have something to do

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
with the E-cadherin.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I have a question.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I have a question

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
and a small suggestion.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Can you try to move

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
your mouse,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
your arrow?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Yes, I just tried to move it.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
So it can't appear

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
on the screen.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
OK, I just wanted to say

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
if you can see the arrow,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
you can use it to point.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
No, it doesn't matter.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I have another question

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
about this research.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
In fact,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
if you look at the schematic above,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
it is actually very zoomed in

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
to the edge

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
that is about to be broken.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
But the picture below

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
is a picture of the entire

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
large area of the microscope.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
So you have to

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
directly see

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
the ABC picture

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
of the small area

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
in the process of hypothesizing.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Your microscope should have, for example,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
tens or hundreds of nanometers

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
of resolution, right?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
In fact, it doesn't have to be

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
like this.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
The series of pictures below

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
is just a snapshot.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
So I'm not sure

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
what the red schematic is.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I'm not sure where it is.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
If you want to see the small area,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
in fact,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
if you can resolve

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
to 100 nanometers

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
or 200 nanometers,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
you can see a point.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
But if you really want to see

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
that my microscope has super resolution,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
we're doing this thing.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
It can resolve to

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
20 nanometers or 30 nanometers.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
OK.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
OK. OK. OK.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
So can you talk now?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Yes, I can talk now.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
In the ABC picture,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
the red thing is acting,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
right?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Yes.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
You said that acting cut off the cell ring.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
That is to say,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
the inside of the membrane, right?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Yes.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
The inside of the cell membrane.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Why is there still a layer of acting outside the cell membrane?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I didn't find this schematic very well.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
It's actually...

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I should have drawn it myself.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
This reference is actually talking about

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
the state of the entire monolayer.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
So the other acting he drew

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
outside is

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
the third cell.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
This...

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
This is my mistake. I'm sorry.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That's the third cell's

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
acting inside the cell membrane.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Yes.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I should have made it clear.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Sorry.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
OK.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
OK.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
OK.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I'll continue.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
OK.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
OK.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Let me go back.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
As I just said,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
a lot of proteins

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
interplay

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
in this process.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Or they appear at different points

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
in different locations.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
The question is

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
when and

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
where does a protein

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
show up?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Everyone who has done cell experiments knows

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
that if you want to see a certain protein,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
you have to

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
connect your protein

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
to something that emits light.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Basically,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
it's not possible to see

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
dozens of proteins at once.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Because there are only four

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
proteins in the entire membrane.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
You can't see

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
dozens of proteins.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
How can you see so many proteins?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
The method everyone uses is to fix

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
the cells and make them into a specimen,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
and then dye them.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
What I'm going to do here is the same.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Fix the cells and dye them.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
But at the same time, I want to have

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
some information.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I want to know

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
how long it takes

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
for the cell to split.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
How long does it take for the cell to split?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So I did

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
a little trick.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It's actually quite

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
ancient.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I threw the cells into the environment

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I wanted them to grow in.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Then I used a large area of Brightfield

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
to shoot it.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I shot it once every five minutes.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
At two points in time, the cells split.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You can see that there are a lot of numbers here.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
The target is the cells that split

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
during this process.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I recorded these positions.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
When I fixed the cells,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I could know that I killed the cells first.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
When I made it into a specimen,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
it was a few minutes

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
or a few hours

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
away from the split.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So it's not

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
a full-scale observation.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But you can use the cell split as a standard.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Then I knew

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
that maybe this cell

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
grew like this after four hours.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Or it grew like this after three hours and 45 minutes.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
So this is

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
to make up for

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
the lack of protein

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
that can't be seen all at once.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
But one drawback is

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
that I can't actually follow the entire cell.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So I made a model

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
from the cell split

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
from 0 minutes to 6 hours.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
The whole process is not the same cell.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I believe that if I collect a little more,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
maybe it can

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
represent the whole process.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Then I used this method

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
to fix the cells and make the dye.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I just asked you to remember

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
E-cadherin, ZO1, and protocloxin.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
The three individuals represent E-cadherin.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
ZO1 is a type function.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Protocloxin is an epico-domain.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
So you can see the first five-minute

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
picture above.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
The first one is an XY cross-section.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
As you can see,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
protocloxin is actually

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
in the middle of two cells.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
It didn't run between

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
the two cells

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
in the five-minute cell split.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
At the same time,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
in the picture on the right,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I turned its perspective

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
to face the cell-to-cell

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
adhesion site.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
So you can see that

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
ZO1 has probably formed

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
a circular state

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
in the middle of the adhesion site.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
So it's the same as what I guessed at the beginning.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
ZO1 is stored there.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It feels like

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
the magenta color

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
and the purple E-cadherin

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
domain

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
should be stopped.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Because the middle is black.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
The black part is where the protocloxin is placed.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Next,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I will continue to look at it.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
After 30 minutes and 45 minutes,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
you can see that

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
the protocloxin slowly moves

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
from the cell to the

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
domain in the middle where the

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
protocloxin is.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Gradually, it fuses in.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
As time goes by,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
rumen is produced.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So it's similar

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
to what I guessed at the beginning.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Protocloxin was formed

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
at an early stage.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Protocloxin is

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
the area

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
to produce the epico-domain.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
So it's the whole

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
process of mapping

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
that we came to a conclusion.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Next,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
at the later stage,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
when the whole thing

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
grows into a cyst,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
we know that it's not a spherical sphere.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Its rumen looks very strange.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It's not a sphere,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
it's a flower.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
We are curious about

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
whether the rumen

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
that it produces

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
will produce rumen.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Secondly, what is the shape of the rumen it produces?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
So I used

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
the cells that killed

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
the two proteins,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
the cells that don't have protocloxin,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
to observe for a long time.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
The number on the left is 905 minutes,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
about 15 hours.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
After the cell division,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
it's about 15 hours,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
4 hours on the right.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
So from the previous picture,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
we know that

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
we will see

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
the epico-components

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
are thrown to that place, ready to be fused.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
So it's been a long time,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
more than 10 hours.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
If it produces rumen, it should be produced.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
But what's interesting is

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
the blue one is protocloxin,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
the epico-components.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
The purple one is e-catechumen.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
We found that protocloxin

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
stopped where it should stop.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It was thrown to that interface,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
but it didn't seem to be able to fuse

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
with the cell membrane.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
So the first question is

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
the epico-components

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
were thrown there smoothly.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
So its polarity

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
was preserved to some extent.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
If we draw a cross-section

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
and look at

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
the protein distribution

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
on the line I drew,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
we can see that

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
in the middle,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
the purple peak is where e-catechumen is.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Where catechumen is,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
there is no protocloxin.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
In fact, protocloxin should be

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
fused into the membrane.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
So it should be

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
colloquialized with e-catechumen.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
But it's not here.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
So we have a question.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
OK,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
there is no tight junction.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
This delivery

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
still exists, but

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
this protein can't be successfully

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
fused to

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
where it should be fused.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
this is still in progress.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I haven't

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
collected a lot of data.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
This amount is not enough.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
OK, I have a question.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Is there a comparison of wild-type?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Sorry, say it again.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Is there a comparison of wild-type?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Is there a comparison of wild-type?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
There is a comparison of wild-type.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
If it's wild-type,

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I'm not prepared today,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
but I have a comparison of wild-type.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
If it's a comparison of wild-type,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I won't draw this cross-section.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Because it's a bit unfair.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
If it's a wild-type,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
you can see

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
this page

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
on the left is a wild-type.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
So you can see

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
there is a beautiful protocloxin in the middle.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Then there is a tight junction next to it,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
which is blue, and then e-catechumen.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
So I won't draw the cross-section direction

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I just drew.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It will be drawn along the later phase direction

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
of the protocloxin.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
But I didn't prepare that plot today.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
But you can see

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
it's a very good colloquize

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
on the layer.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
So you mean

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
the yellow part

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
is actually with the pink part?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
In wild-type, no.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It should be like this.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
What I just said is not quite right.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Sorry.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
If it's along...

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I don't like the mark.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
So if it's like this on the left,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
if we draw a line along this purple line,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
let's just say

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
we draw a line along the purple line.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
You should see two very high peaks.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Then next to it is e-catechumen.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Then near the yellow part

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
there will be two very high blue peaks.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Then there will be a very large peak in the middle

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
which is yellow.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
So when you draw this plot along this surface,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
you will see that

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
all three proteins are on this surface.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Then

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
if it's like this case,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
if it's along this purple line,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
you won't see the blue line.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I just want to emphasize

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
that the blue one can't

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
go to the e-catechumen.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I hope this is clear.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Oh.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
So in wild-type,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
there is no e-catechumen

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
near the protocallicin.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Yes, that's right.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
That's what I mean.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
OK.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Let's continue.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I just said that the e-catechumen is removed.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
In wild-type, sometimes

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
there are very few cells

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
that can't form an e-catechumen ring.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
It can't

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
form a ring

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
to protect

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
the area

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
that should be protected.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
So some cells can't form

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
e-catechumen.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So I caught these cells.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I also drew the plot.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
So the plot here

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
shows the same thing.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
There is a purple area.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
If it goes like this,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
there should be protocallicin in that area.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
But now the purple area

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
occupies the yellow area.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
So whether or not

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
the e-catechumen

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
can form

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
an e-catechumen ring,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
in the early stage,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
is a very important thing.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
But in the later stage,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
when it grows into a large cyst,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
it has e-catechumen, for sure.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
But in the early stage,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
the mechanism of e-catechumen

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
is different from that of wild-type.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
So how does it form e-catechumen in the later stage

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
is actually quite interesting.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
We also want to look at this.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
This is the result

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I have obtained

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
for this mapping so far.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I haven't collected a lot of data yet,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
but I should be able to

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
collect some results later.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Another thing I want to

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
discuss today

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
is that

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I just said that

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
the entire e-catechumen

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
is a sphere.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So e-catechumen is like a magnet,

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
with a ring around it.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
In the process of opening the entire e-catechumen,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
we are curious about

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
how it opens.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
So I took a picture of

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
this e-catechumen in two cells.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It's like a cell on the outside of the screen

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
and a cell behind the screen.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
The ring of this e-catechumen

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
is a bit like

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
an oscillation

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
in the whole process.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
It's like a big and small

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
oscillation.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So I went to

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
quantize its projected area.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
As time went by,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
it did seem to have some oscillation,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
but it wasn't that obvious.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
This is what I found recently.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I don't have a lot of data

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
to prove that it's really oscillating.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
But I checked the reference.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
It's not in

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
MDCK cells,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
but in liver cells.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Someone found

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
a similar oscillation.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But you can see that

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
the time scale in the upper right corner

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
is quite different from the time scale in the lower left corner.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
This may be caused by

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
different cell types.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
But

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
they also found oscillation.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
They proposed a physical model.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
This oscillation

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
can be grown

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
by three mechanisms.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
The first one is

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
the liquid

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
in it.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
The liquid slowly

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
fills in and grows.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Because

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
e-catechumen

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
has sealed

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
the entire lumen,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
it doesn't look like

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
a ball of air.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
When you fill it in,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
it slowly grows.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Another mechanism

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
is to shrink the lumen.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Why?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Because each cell

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
wants to

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
get farther and farther.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
If the entire cell

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
is spherical,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
it has the lowest energy.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
So there's a mechanism

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
to shrink the lumen.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
This is the

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
contracellular cortex.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Lateral adhesions

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
outside the lumen

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
constantly

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
want to

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
increase the connection

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
between the cells.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
They want to

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
clear the lumen.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
These three mechanisms

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
cause the oscillation.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
But it's not.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
These three mechanisms

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
don't cause the oscillation.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
There's an active term

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
which is the shrinkage

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
of the cortex.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
It's a function of time.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Because the lumen grows,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
it becomes stronger.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
It causes the oscillation.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
personally

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
don't have

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
100% sure about this.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
So

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
we propose another hypothesis.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
It's not about

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
the size of the lumen.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It's about

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
whether the cortex looks good or not.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
This is our hypothesis.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It needs to be verified.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
But I think

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
it's possible.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
The next

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
case is

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I think

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I should

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
finish this first.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Oh, no. Let me

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
look back.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I think it's related to the cortex.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
One of the reasons is

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Sorry.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
OK.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
If we

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
look at a cyst,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
it looks like a sphere.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
When there's or not a cortex,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
we find something interesting.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's a cyst with a cortex.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I label it as

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
P-myosin.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
P-myosin is a motor protein

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
that makes the cortex shrink.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
So you can see

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
it doesn't have a strong motor protein.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
It's only on the outside.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
But if we remove the cortex,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
you can see the whole cell

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
has a strong cortex.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
It makes us think

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
whether there's a cortex

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
is related to the cortex.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
It's not confirmed.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
It's not confirmed, but it's not true.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
It's just my guess.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
At the beginning,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I used green to represent

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
P-myosin and red to represent

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
P-myosin.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
P-myosin is a certain density.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It's a certain density

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
around the P-myosin.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Because there's a lot of

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Because there's a lot of

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
contract R4 in the next two cells,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I hope I can reduce the Rumer.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Because there's a certain magnitude

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
of the contract R4.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Then, because these

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
epico-dom, epico-membrane, epico-dom,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
epico-component are all being thrown

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
to this place.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Because of physicality, the more molecules,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
they naturally want to expand.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
At the same time, P-myosin

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
did not supplement in time.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
The whole is a sphere.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
So you can see the local P-myosin

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
density is decreasing.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Because of this decline,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
then, at the same time,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
it's like this.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
In the whole Lumen growing process,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
it's like this.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
This is my personal guess.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I haven't verified it yet.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I currently have a simple experiment

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
to prove that

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
it's actually

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
contract R4 and

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
P-myosin interplay,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
not pressure or other mechanisms.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Because I added

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
a certain kind of medicine to the cell.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
The medicine will reduce

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
the contract R4,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
the contractility between the cells.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
What I see here is

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
this P-myosin ring did not grow

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
without contract R4.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
If it is pressure,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
it should grow automatically

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
because there is no force pulling it back.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
So it can be seen that P-myosin

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
really confined the whole Lumen.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
So I think

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
it's not very clear.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
But this is my guess.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
OK.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
To sum up today's summary,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
the first thing is

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
from my mapping,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
my idea is that P-myosin

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
at the stage of two cells,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
it preserves the space

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
where Lumen is produced.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
So it can produce Lumen later.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Next,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
if there is no P-myosin,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
it does not affect

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
whether EpicoComponent can be thrown into the interface,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
but whether it can be fused

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
to the membrane.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
The third thing is

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
it will cause the dynamics

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
of the whole Lumen,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
which is an oscillation.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Whether it grows well

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
or not depends on

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
the interplay between

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
EpicoComponent and P-myosin.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
OK. This is my lab.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Let me introduce it to you.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I have two labs.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
If there is a result,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
we hope to build a physical model

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
for the two labs.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
The lab on the left is my lab.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
The lab on the right is my lab.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I have two bosses.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
We have this special program.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You will have two teachers.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
They both

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
belong to MPI,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
but they work in

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
different fields.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Time and computational modeling,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
or time and image processing.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
We have such a program.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
So here,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
we are very close.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
If you are interested in

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
my institute or have any questions,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
my email is

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
chwng6601 gmail.com.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
You can contact me.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
OK.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
These are my three institutes.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
The yellow one is my boss.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
The middle one is my institute.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
The right one is my school.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
OK.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Thank you.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
OK.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Before we start,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
let's applaud

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
and thank our speaker

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
for his wonderful speech.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Thank you.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Let's start

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
the Q&A.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Hello.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Hi.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I'm Adam.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I have a question.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
There are different

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
size of lumen

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
in human or mammal.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
What you do is

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
renal.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I want to ask

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
if there is any comparison

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
between ZO1 in

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
vascular or renal

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
or various lumen

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
epithelial cell expression level.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
ZO1 seems to

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
regulate the size of lumen.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Right?

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Personally,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I don't do this comparison.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
But it's difficult

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
to do this.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
If you know ZO1,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
you know it's not only in junction.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
There are many cytoplasmic cells.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
In my experiment,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
it's like this.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
If you want to take out a single cell

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and run a gene or something,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
it's a little bit

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
inaccurate.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
What we are doing now

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
is adding ZO1

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
with click chemistry.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
It's a detail.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
We add a tag on ZO1.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
The tag will be connected by some molecules.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
We connect all ZO1

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
in the cell,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
even ZO1 on the membrane.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Then we can see the result.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
But we don't do it in other species.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
OK. I see.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I'm just curious.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
If you are

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
over-express ZO1

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
in MDCK,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
what will it look like?

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
If it's

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
a normal amount,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
you can imagine

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
it's a football.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
ZO1

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
along the lumen

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
is like a football.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
If it's a normal amount,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
you can see it's a little bit straight and crooked.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
But if you over-express it,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
you can see it's very crooked.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
It's like

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
a very strong confine.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
That's what I think.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
But it's true.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
OK. Thank you.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Any other questions?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
OK.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
You can think about

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
any other questions.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
OK.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
If you want to know

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
what Project Tyra is doing,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I believe

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
if I'm not wrong,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
you all saw the Facebook announcement

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
and joined today's talk.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Tyra actually has a website.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
You can see the link

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
of Tyra's website

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
under the announcement.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
And how to join

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Tyra as a member.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Or if you want to share your research,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
or

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
what Tyra's ultimate goal is, etc.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
If you're interested, you can check it out.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I'll ask one more time.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Any other questions?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
If there are no questions,

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
let's give a round of applause

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
to thank Chen He for his wonderful talk.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Thank you.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Thank you.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I'm going to stop recording.
