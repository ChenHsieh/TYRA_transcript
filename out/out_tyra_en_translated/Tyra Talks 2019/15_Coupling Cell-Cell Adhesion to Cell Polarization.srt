00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We are very honored to have Wang Chenghe in Germany to give us a speech.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The topic of today's speech is Coupling Cell-Cell Adhesion to Cell Polarization.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It is mainly a research on biophysics.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:36,000
First, let me introduce our speaker today.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Our speaker today is Wang Chenghe.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He is currently in Germany.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He graduated from the University of Taiwan Institute of Technology.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When he was a master's thesis, he did a preliminary personalized breast cancer drug test.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
After graduation, he served in Taiwan for three years in the light company.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The main thing is to do 3D laser imaging development.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
After graduation, he did a measurement study of cell grafting in the Institute of Medical Sciences.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then, from his previous field in the Institute of Medical Sciences, he switched to the field of biophysics.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Currently, he is a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute of Cell Biology and Genetics in Germany.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What he is studying now is what he is going to tell us today.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It is the early cell-cell adhesion study of cell polarization.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We remind everyone that we have to turn on the microphone to applaud our speaker.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's applaud to welcome our speaker.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you all. Please start.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you all.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I just introduced myself. I am Wang Chenghe.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I am now in the third year of my doctoral studies.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I am going to share with you my research in the past three years.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you have any questions later, you can interrupt me.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can interrupt me and ask questions directly.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We can discuss at the same time.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you have any questions, please say a phrase first.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then ask your question.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Otherwise, I may continue to talk at once.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because there is a lag, I am afraid that this will be interfered with.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am currently a doctoral student in Germany.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
My research is actually looking at the connection between cells and the relationship between cell polarization.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is a very big topic.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't know what the background is today.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I prepared a simple general introduction.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The main thing is to connect cells.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You should know that we have learned from high school students that cells are composed of organs.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So cells have a regular arrangement in the animal body.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It can be arranged into different organs or organs with different functions.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
One of the organs is called the epithelium.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In Chinese, it is the upper arm cell.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It basically consists of cells in the animal body.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It is a cell organ that surrounds these cells.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For example, like your kidney or your stomach.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
These cells will have such a cell on top.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
As you can see, this is my mouse.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It doesn't matter.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Anyway, one of the features of this cell is that when it forms a cell,

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
it is mainly a simple single cell.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then go around this cell to form such a structure.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can see that the lower right corner is a multi-layer cell.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But most of them are actually single cells that form such a structure.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why does this cell form such a structure?

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And what mechanism do they have?

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In fact, this has been studied for a very, very long time.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Such a single cell is connected to a single cell.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They actually have some common features to share.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
One of the features is that there is a tree on top of it.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It is an epithelial membrane that does not connect to anything.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We call it epithelial membrane.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There is nothing on this cell.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It can be said that there is no contact with any cell

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or this kind of epithelial membrane.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It is epithelial membrane.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then there will be some connections between cells.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because you know that these cells are linked together.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So it is very intuitive to think that they form a connection.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This connection is what we call a lateral membrane.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The third membrane is the basal membrane.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The basal membrane is the membrane that the cell connects to the external environment,

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the ECM, or the reflection environment of the cell.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Basal membrane.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So there are only three main membranes in this cell.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Everyone is very curious about how the cell controls each cell

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
so that these three membranes can be placed well

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and form a connection at the same time.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then it will not form a strange shape,

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but a slightly organized shape.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So this matter, whether in biophysics or biophysics,

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
is actually a problem that has been studied for a very long time.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To do this kind of research, you can use a lot of different materials.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can do mouse experiments.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can do things.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You can do anything.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can do cell lines.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like me, I focus on using cell lines.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I don't do animal experiments.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The cell line I use is a cell called MDCK.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MDCK cells are mainly...

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The origin of MDCK cells is the sacral tube of the dog.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So it will form a wall.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It will form a tube.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's say a tube.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But in fact, in a lot of research, it just forms a sphere.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
OK, anyway, I don't care.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Our study model,

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it looks for two cells from one cell.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Everyone knows the cell division.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
After the division, it will form a cell-cell connection at the beginning.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me find a reference here.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Its label is green.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The green part is the connection between two cells.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The two blue ones are the two cell boxes.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
OK, and then it continues to grow.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
After it continues to grow, it will form the one on the far right.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The one you see now.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Blue is still a cell box.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Green is the connection between cells.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is a plane.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What you see now is a sphere.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The red one is what I just said.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The place in the middle of the box.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's a lumen.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a lumen with all kinds of liquid and all kinds of nutrients in it.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A box with all kinds of molecules in it.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a lumen.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Then the cells form a single cell connection structure like this.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Then wrap the lumen in the middle.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We call it cyst.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you have ever studied MDCK culture,

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you will know that if you put it in an environment where there are no cells,

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it will grow like this.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
OK.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you remember what I just said,

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Epico, Lateral and Basal,

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
three different membranes.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
In more detail,

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
these three membranes are actually filled with different molecules.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Whether it's liquid or protein.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But what I'm talking about here is protein.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Protein on the membrane.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In Epico,

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've listed two types here.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
One is called protocollicin or CrOMS.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You don't have to remember these names.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But in Epico,

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
please remember protocollicin first.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This protein.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because I will use this protein in the next experiment.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
To represent whether the cells have grown Epico membranes.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This thing.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then there's Basal.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Indicator.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's like the corner of a cell.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It will form a connection with the nucleus of the cell.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I didn't do too much of Basal.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I did it more in the previous lab.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But I'm not focusing on this now.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So I won't cover it here today.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then there are cells.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's like my title today.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Cellular adhesions.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Cellular adhesions have a lot of different types.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We call it adhesion receptor.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You can think of it as a plug.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Protein is like a plug.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It will connect.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It will form a cell-cell connection.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There are four types here.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I only listed about four types.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
In fact, it can be roughly divided into orange and red.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Two are a kind.

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a kind.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then the blue and green below are another kind.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You just have to remember the green one.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
E-cadherin.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Because I will use E-cadherin to represent the next experiment.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Lateral adhesions between cell membranes.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So anyway.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In short, these three domains are defined by these different protein distributions.

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In past research, many people have removed these different proteins.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you are not a biological background,

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Protein's performance is removed in this cell.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It doesn't produce this protein.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Then look at what impact it has on the entire structure.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Pay attention to the sphere structure in the upper right corner.

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a normal structure.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you remove any protein, it doesn't produce that structure.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It means that the polarization of this cell is affected.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So after removing some proteins, you will see that it produces more than one lumen.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It means that the mechanism of the epico-membrane is affected.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Or more seriously,

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Other influences may cause it to grow into a sphere.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Or grow into a very large cluster, like a tumor.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So after removing a protein,

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What is the final result?

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In fact, a lot of papers have already started to study this.

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
A lot of papers have been doing this since 2000.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But what we want to end up in this study is the process.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That is, in the entire dynamics, from one cell to this multi-cell process.

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How are these proteins affected by each other?

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And when are these proteins produced?

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And where are they?

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And when is it important?

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's important for the whole thing to grow into a normal shape.

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is what I'm mainly doing.

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you look at the three pictures above me,

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You will find that the process is actually very simple.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The cells are divided into two cells.

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The two cells continue to separate and separate.

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Finally, it grows into such a spherical structure.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But you can notice one thing.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The red epico here is the domain of the epico.

204
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's actually not in the final right.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was produced under the multi-cell situation on the right.

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It was already produced when there were two cells.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In the middle of the two cells,

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You can say that it is almost in the middle of the domain where the two cells are connected.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Just produced this epico domain.

210
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This epico domain is produced in such an early state.

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So we are very curious about how the mechanism tells the cell

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You have to throw your epico domain there.

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Instead of throwing it somewhere else.

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So we are curious about this.

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
In addition,

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's not actually split into two from one.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It will form this domain.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is from my own data.

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You put the two cells together.

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then after a long time, it will eventually form this epico domain.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The red part is the epico domain.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The green part is the same as above.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's the adhesion of the two cells.

224
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So we have an intuitive idea.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Will it be when the two cells are connected?

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
These proteins.

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I just marked four next to it.

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
One of them tells the cell that

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
OK, I have a neighbor next to me.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I now have this neighbor.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I have to produce an epico membrane between me and my neighbor.

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So we came up with a project at the beginning.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's very intuitive.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Since it's two cells,

235
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Which one do we want to see?

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Protein

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Cells connect to proteins.

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's dominated by this thing.

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So let's get rid of a cell.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's like hitting a single cell.

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's do this.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then we replace one of the cells with a supported lipid bilayer.

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's a lipid bilayer.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You know from the name.

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's a double-layered membrane.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We put different receptors on this membrane.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Lateral adhesion receptor.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Put it on this membrane.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Then we can see what kind of reaction the cell will have to which type.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So after we drop the cell,

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's look at the interaction between it and the receptor below.

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This receptor is on the membrane.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
One of the benefits of the supported lipid bilayer above is

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If you only have a fixed situation,

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Cell adhesion is dead.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It can't self-organize.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It can't do what it wants to do.

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So if we put it on the lipid bilayer,

259
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It can move freely.

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So after the cell goes down,

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It can depend on its own

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Whether it's its own internal mechanics

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Or its own chemical reaction

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Will produce the same result.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Ideally, we can find

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Some kind of receptor

267
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That can activate the epico-domain

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Between the cells.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But unfortunately,

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The cells don't like this environment.

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So I spent a year and a half doing this.

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The cells actually ate it.

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This research is actually quite useful.

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because it purifies a lot of different proteins.

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We tried to do this experiment.

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But the cells don't like it.

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But that doesn't mean this method won't work.

278
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's just that we may need a very long time at this stage.

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So I gave up this method.

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I didn't do it in this direction.

281
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I started to do this experiment

282
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In a situation that wasn't so ambitious.

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So we went back to the state of two cells.

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We don't have to do bilayer.

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We just observe these two cells.

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What must be missing in the middle?

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We didn't notice.

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Because the cells don't like the receptor.

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And the cells will die.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And the epico-domain won't be produced.

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So we went back to the literature.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
To see how it goes from one cell to two cells.

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The first process is cell division.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
In the last step of cell division,

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Cut the two cells apart.

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There is a step called cytokinesis.

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Those of you who studied cell biology should know.

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Cytokinesis is a very strong cytoskeletal force.

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's like a circular scissor.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Cut the link between the two cells.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
After the cut,

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If a cell doesn't form a link,

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It will form two independent cells.

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But what we see now is the epithelial cell.

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Two cells will form a link.

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So it's not completely cut off.

307
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
At the same time, it forms a link.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
When it forms a link,

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I forgot to say one thing.

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Before it's cut off,

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
There will be a tubulin between the two cells.

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Tubulin is also a cytoskeleton.

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's a kind of bridge.

314
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
A track.

315
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It will stay there.

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We call it the midbody.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This midbody will remain in the entire cell division.

318
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The midbody is the place where the epithelial domain is generated.

319
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Next, there will be vesicles.

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
These vesicles carry the proteins that form the epithelial membrane.

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Or lipids.

322
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The proteins will be transported to this place.

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
After the transportation,

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
These proteins are fused to the middle.

325
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
After being fused,

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It will expand more and more.

327
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
These epithelial domains are connected.

328
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But the proteins in the epithelial domain

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
don't form a link.

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So we thought that

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
they will form a repulsive force.

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And gradually expand.

333
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This process has been studied by many people.

334
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Many people already know

335
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
what kind of proteins are important for this delivery.

336
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What can we do?

337
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We care about the selection of cells.

338
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So we think that the connection between cells

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
should be interplayed with delivery.

340
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So the first thing we suspect is

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the important selection of the epithelial membrane.

342
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We think it's high junction.

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
OK, I haven't said what high junction is.

344
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
High junction is the picture on the right.

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's a small T-J.

346
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So if you look at the picture on the right,

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If you think of it as 3D,

348
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The entire lumen is a sphere.

349
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The T-J high junction is like a round ring.

350
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Then this sphere,

351
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You can think of it as a channel.

352
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's like a channel of this lumen.

353
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Seal this lumen.

354
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So we think that

355
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This high junction has always been

356
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This lumen and its lateral adhesion

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The interface between its cellular connections.

358
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So we think it has something to do with

359
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the production of the entire epithelial membrane.

360
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So the next question is

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have a question.

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
How fast is the time scale of this whole process?

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
OK, so from the leftmost cell division

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Then to the rightmost one, it's about 6 hours.

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
5 to 6 hours.

366
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
5 to 6 hours.

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Is it about the same time for each step?

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Or which one is particularly long?

369
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Which one is particularly long?

370
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
From the four schematics I drew below

371
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I took four schematics.

372
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The one on the right and the one on the left

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's about four hours apart.

374
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You mean the last arrow, right?

375
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes, so it's from the first schematic to the third.

376
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Maybe only one hour in the middle.

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, I see.

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But the last one takes several hours.

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I see. OK.

380
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
OK, thank you.

381
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So we're curious about

382
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
When was this high junction produced?

383
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let me introduce it to you today.

384
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What is high junction?

385
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If you remember, I just talked about epico, lateral, and basal.

386
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Three domains.

387
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In fact, there is a red band in the middle.

388
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I didn't introduce it.

389
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's high junction.

390
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's in the interface between epico and lateral membrane.

391
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And it will always exist in that place.

392
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The main protein group

393
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There are actually a lot of high junction protein groups.

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Basically, what I drew here

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The red, blue, and purple on the schematic.

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The three are its receptors.

397
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The main ones are occluden, occluden, and GEMS.

398
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Of course, occluden has a lot of kinds of occluden.

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Occluden has a lot of kinds of occluden.

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
GEMS has a lot of kinds.

401
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So it's not just a protein.

402
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It has a lot of kinds.

403
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
On the inside of the cell

404
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can see that there is a yellow, orange, and green.

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Three proteins.

406
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ZO1, ZO2, and ZO3.

407
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's actually a high junction.

408
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's connected to the inside of the cell.

409
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's not directly connected to other cells.

410
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But it's connected to occluden, GEMS, and occluden.

411
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This picture is a bit misleading.

412
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I haven't found a better one yet.

413
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It doesn't mean that ZO1 is based on occluden.

415
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
ZO2 is based on occluden.

416
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
ZO3 is based on GEMS.

417
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The three are actually mixed together.

418
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
In my understanding.

419
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's not just based on one kind.

420
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
ZO1 can be based on three proteins.

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Anyway, it's a mixed state here.

422
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I hope everyone can remember ZO1 protein.

423
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Because ZO1 protein is a very important protein in my next experiment.

424
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There has been research to prove that.

425
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Obviously, after you remove ZO1 and ZO2.

426
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
After the cells do not produce these two proteins.

427
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The high junction between the cells will not be produced.

428
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is very important to my experiment.

429
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Everyone remember this first.

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Its main function is high junction.

431
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So, as the name suggests, it's very tight.

432
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So, it's the closest link between cells.

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a close connection.

434
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's like the whole cell connection is sealed together.

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So, you can imagine that the entire lumen can be considered to be sealed by this high junction.

436
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So, we think that whether there is a high junction to produce lumen.

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It will definitely have a relationship.

438
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So, let's start the next experiment.

439
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OK.

440
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What I want to say here is.

441
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I just talked about high junction.

442
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And epical membrane.

443
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What is the situation in the middle?

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How is it produced?

445
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why can the high junction be produced in the middle?

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So, I just went back to the schematic I just mentioned.

447
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
From cell division to lumen.

448
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The color is a bit messy here.

449
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Sorry, I have a lot of slimes here.

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
OK.

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The red one represents the cytokinesis I just mentioned.

452
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Contractile ring.

453
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's like a knife.

454
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Cut the two cells apart.

455
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The green one is the high junction I just mentioned.

456
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It will form the lumen.

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
In the reference diagram.

458
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The small schematic with the high junction.

459
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's a half-circle.

460
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
A diagram.

461
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So, the blue high junction is a cell.

462
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The blue low junction is a cell.

463
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The red one is the protein representing the red circle.

464
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The red one is the protein representing the red circle.

465
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The protein slowly cuts into the cell membrane.

466
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The protein slowly cuts into the cell membrane.

467
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Cut the cells apart.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
At the same time.

469
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It will put the later adhesions.

470
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Remember the protein eCathctors and eHearing.

471
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It will carry these two cells.

472
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It will carry these two cells.

473
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a gap now that puts the later adhesions.

474
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It will ahead of itself.

475
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Like I said before,

476
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
there's a mid-body.

477
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
A right center.

478
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There's a tubulin.

479
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000


480
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
creating the later adhesion.

481
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So the mid-body is important.

482
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So the mid-body is important.

483
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But the mid-body will be cut off.

484
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But the mid-body will be cut off.

485
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Because the two cells need to be completely separated.

486
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So there must be a point

487
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So there must be a point

488
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
for the later adhesion to stop.

489
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We think that's what Pythagoras is doing.

490
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Pythagoras stops

491
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
near the mid-body

492
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
so that the later adhesion

493
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
won't directly invade

494
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the area between the cells.

495
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We want to leave this gap

496
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
so that the apical membrane can be created.

497
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is one of our assumptions.

498
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The reason why I say this

499
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
is because we observe

500
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the cytokinesis

501
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
in the process of cell separation.

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The high junction and

503
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the later adhesion,

504
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
both exist at the same time

505
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
as the cytokinesis ring.

506
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
as the cytokinesis ring.

507
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
As you can see here,

508
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you can imagine

509
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the cytokinesis cell

510
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
is behind the screen.

511
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So you can see the interface

512
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
between the two cells.

513
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
There is such a large actin,

514
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the cytokinesis countertowel ring.

515
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It separates the two cells.

516
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
At the same time, you can see

517
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the ZO1 and E-cadherin,

518
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
these two proteins,

519
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
are wrapped inside

520
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the large countertowel ring

521
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
or collocalized.

522
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So when we see this,

523
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
the ZO1 is squeezed

524
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
in the middle.

525
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The E-cadherin

526
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
has its mechanism

527
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
to keep it outside.

528
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The good later adhesion

529
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
also keeps the ZO1

530
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
which is the place

531
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
where the next ethical membrane

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is going to be created.

533
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
At the same time,

534
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
we want to know

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
if there is no ZO1,

536
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
is there no

537
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
E-cadherin,

538
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
then we will

539
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
remove the ZO1 and ZO2

540
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
proteins inside the cell.

541
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So here you can see

542
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
a cross-section

543
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
of the entire cyst.

544
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So the wild type on the left,

545
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
the black hole in the middle

546
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is the lumen.

547
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The E-cadherin,

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the lumen in the middle

549
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
is very spherical.

550
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
After the ZO1 and ZO2

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
are removed,

552
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
there is still a small lumen in the middle.

553
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
At first, we thought

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
there was still a lumen after the ZO1 and ZO2 were removed.

555
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Maybe it has nothing to do

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
with the lumen.

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
At the same time,

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
if we carefully draw

559
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the lumen contour,

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
believe me,

561
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it will look like this.

562
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We think it is

563
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
a flower-shaped lumen.

564
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Based on this,

565
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
we think

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
whether the lumen

567
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
has something to do

568
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
with the E-cadherin.

569
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The E-cadherin

570
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
may not have anything to do

571
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
with the E-cadherin.

572
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But whether the lumen

573
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
can grow into a sphere

574
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
may have something to do

575
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
with the E-cadherin.

576
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I have a question.

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I have a question

578
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and a small suggestion.

579
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Can you try to move

580
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
your mouse,

581
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
your arrow?

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yes, I just tried to move it.

583
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So it can't appear

584
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
on the screen.

585
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
OK, I just wanted to say

586
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
if you can see the arrow,

587
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
you can use it to point.

588
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No, it doesn't matter.

589
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I have another question

590
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
about this research.

591
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
In fact,

592
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
if you look at the schematic above,

593
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
it is actually very zoomed in

594
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
to the edge

595
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
that is about to be broken.

596
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But the picture below

597
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
is a picture of the entire

598
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
large area of the microscope.

599
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So you have to

600
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
directly see

601
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the ABC picture

602
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
of the small area

603
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
in the process of hypothesizing.

604
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Your microscope should have, for example,

605
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
tens or hundreds of nanometers

606
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
of resolution, right?

607
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
In fact, it doesn't have to be

608
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
like this.

609
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The series of pictures below

610
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
is just a snapshot.

611
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So I'm not sure

612
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
what the red schematic is.

613
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm not sure where it is.

614
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If you want to see the small area,

615
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
in fact,

616
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
if you can resolve

617
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
to 100 nanometers

618
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
or 200 nanometers,

619
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you can see a point.

620
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But if you really want to see

621
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that my microscope has super resolution,

622
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
we're doing this thing.

623
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It can resolve to

624
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
20 nanometers or 30 nanometers.

625
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
OK.

626
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
OK. OK. OK.

627
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So can you talk now?

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes, I can talk now.

629
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
In the ABC picture,

630
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the red thing is acting,

631
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
right?

632
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes.

633
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You said that acting cut off the cell ring.

634
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That is to say,

635
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the inside of the membrane, right?

636
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yes.

637
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The inside of the cell membrane.

638
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Why is there still a layer of acting outside the cell membrane?

639
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I didn't find this schematic very well.

640
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's actually...

641
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I should have drawn it myself.

642
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
This reference is actually talking about

643
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the state of the entire monolayer.

644
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So the other acting he drew

645
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
outside is

646
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
the third cell.

647
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This...

648
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
This is my mistake. I'm sorry.

649
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's the third cell's

650
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
acting inside the cell membrane.

651
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yes.

652
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I should have made it clear.

653
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Sorry.

654
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
OK.

655
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
OK.

656
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
OK.

657
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'll continue.

658
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
OK.

659
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
OK.

660
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let me go back.

661
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
As I just said,

662
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
a lot of proteins

663
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
interplay

664
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
in this process.

665
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Or they appear at different points

666
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in different locations.

667
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The question is

668
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
when and

669
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
where does a protein

670
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
show up?

671
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Everyone who has done cell experiments knows

672
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that if you want to see a certain protein,

673
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you have to

674
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
connect your protein

675
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to something that emits light.

676
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Basically,

677
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's not possible to see

678
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
dozens of proteins at once.

679
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because there are only four

680
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
proteins in the entire membrane.

681
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You can't see

682
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
dozens of proteins.

683
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
How can you see so many proteins?

684
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The method everyone uses is to fix

685
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
the cells and make them into a specimen,

686
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and then dye them.

687
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
What I'm going to do here is the same.

688
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Fix the cells and dye them.

689
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But at the same time, I want to have

690
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
some information.

691
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I want to know

692
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
how long it takes

693
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
for the cell to split.

694
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
How long does it take for the cell to split?

695
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So I did

696
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
a little trick.

697
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's actually quite

698
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
ancient.

699
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I threw the cells into the environment

700
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I wanted them to grow in.

701
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Then I used a large area of Brightfield

702
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
to shoot it.

703
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I shot it once every five minutes.

704
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
At two points in time, the cells split.

705
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You can see that there are a lot of numbers here.

706
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The target is the cells that split

707
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
during this process.

708
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I recorded these positions.

709
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
When I fixed the cells,

710
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I could know that I killed the cells first.

711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
When I made it into a specimen,

712
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
it was a few minutes

713
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
or a few hours

714
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
away from the split.

715
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So it's not

716
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
a full-scale observation.

717
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But you can use the cell split as a standard.

718
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Then I knew

719
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
that maybe this cell

720
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
grew like this after four hours.

721
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Or it grew like this after three hours and 45 minutes.

722
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So this is

723
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
to make up for

724
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
the lack of protein

725
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that can't be seen all at once.

726
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But one drawback is

727
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
that I can't actually follow the entire cell.

728
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So I made a model

729
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
from the cell split

730
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
from 0 minutes to 6 hours.

731
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The whole process is not the same cell.

732
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I believe that if I collect a little more,

733
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
maybe it can

734
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
represent the whole process.

735
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Then I used this method

736
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to fix the cells and make the dye.

737
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I just asked you to remember

738
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
E-cadherin, ZO1, and protocloxin.

739
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The three individuals represent E-cadherin.

740
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
ZO1 is a type function.

741
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Protocloxin is an epico-domain.

742
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So you can see the first five-minute

743
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
picture above.

744
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The first one is an XY cross-section.

745
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
As you can see,

746
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
protocloxin is actually

747
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
in the middle of two cells.

748
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It didn't run between

749
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the two cells

750
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
in the five-minute cell split.

751
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
At the same time,

752
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
in the picture on the right,

753
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I turned its perspective

754
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to face the cell-to-cell

755
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
adhesion site.

756
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So you can see that

757
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
ZO1 has probably formed

758
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
a circular state

759
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
in the middle of the adhesion site.

760
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So it's the same as what I guessed at the beginning.

761
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
ZO1 is stored there.

762
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It feels like

763
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
the magenta color

764
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and the purple E-cadherin

765
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
domain

766
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
should be stopped.

767
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Because the middle is black.

768
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The black part is where the protocloxin is placed.

769
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Next,

770
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I will continue to look at it.

771
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
After 30 minutes and 45 minutes,

772
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
you can see that

773
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the protocloxin slowly moves

774
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
from the cell to the

775
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
domain in the middle where the

776
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
protocloxin is.

777
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Gradually, it fuses in.

778
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
As time goes by,

779
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
rumen is produced.

780
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So it's similar

781
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to what I guessed at the beginning.

782
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Protocloxin was formed

783
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
at an early stage.

784
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Protocloxin is

785
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
the area

786
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
to produce the epico-domain.

787
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So it's the whole

788
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
process of mapping

789
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that we came to a conclusion.

790
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Next,

791
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
at the later stage,

792
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
when the whole thing

793
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
grows into a cyst,

794
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
we know that it's not a spherical sphere.

795
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Its rumen looks very strange.

796
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's not a sphere,

797
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
it's a flower.

798
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We are curious about

799
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
whether the rumen

800
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
that it produces

801
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
will produce rumen.

802
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Secondly, what is the shape of the rumen it produces?

803
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So I used

804
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the cells that killed

805
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
the two proteins,

806
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
the cells that don't have protocloxin,

807
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
to observe for a long time.

808
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The number on the left is 905 minutes,

809
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
about 15 hours.

810
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
After the cell division,

811
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
it's about 15 hours,

812
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
4 hours on the right.

813
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So from the previous picture,

814
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
we know that

815
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
we will see

816
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the epico-components

817
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
are thrown to that place, ready to be fused.

818
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So it's been a long time,

819
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
more than 10 hours.

820
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
If it produces rumen, it should be produced.

821
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But what's interesting is

822
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the blue one is protocloxin,

823
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the epico-components.

824
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The purple one is e-catechumen.

825
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We found that protocloxin

826
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
stopped where it should stop.

827
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It was thrown to that interface,

828
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
but it didn't seem to be able to fuse

829
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
with the cell membrane.

830
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So the first question is

831
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
the epico-components

832
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
were thrown there smoothly.

833
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So its polarity

834
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
was preserved to some extent.

835
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If we draw a cross-section

836
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and look at

837
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
the protein distribution

838
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
on the line I drew,

839
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
we can see that

840
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
in the middle,

841
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
the purple peak is where e-catechumen is.

842
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Where catechumen is,

843
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
there is no protocloxin.

844
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
In fact, protocloxin should be

845
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
fused into the membrane.

846
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So it should be

847
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
colloquialized with e-catechumen.

848
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But it's not here.

849
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So we have a question.

850
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
OK,

851
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
there is no tight junction.

852
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This delivery

853
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
still exists, but

854
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
this protein can't be successfully

855
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
fused to

856
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
where it should be fused.

857
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So

858
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
this is still in progress.

859
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I haven't

860
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
collected a lot of data.

861
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
This amount is not enough.

862
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
OK, I have a question.

863
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Is there a comparison of wild-type?

864
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Sorry, say it again.

865
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Is there a comparison of wild-type?

866
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Is there a comparison of wild-type?

867
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
There is a comparison of wild-type.

868
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
If it's wild-type,

869
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm not prepared today,

870
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
but I have a comparison of wild-type.

871
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
If it's a comparison of wild-type,

872
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I won't draw this cross-section.

873
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because it's a bit unfair.

874
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
If it's a wild-type,

875
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you can see

876
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
this page

877
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
on the left is a wild-type.

878
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So you can see

879
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
there is a beautiful protocloxin in the middle.

880
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Then there is a tight junction next to it,

881
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
which is blue, and then e-catechumen.

882
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So I won't draw the cross-section direction

883
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I just drew.

884
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It will be drawn along the later phase direction

885
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
of the protocloxin.

886
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But I didn't prepare that plot today.

887
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But you can see

888
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
it's a very good colloquize

889
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
on the layer.

890
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So you mean

891
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the yellow part

892
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
is actually with the pink part?

893
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
In wild-type, no.

894
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It should be like this.

895
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What I just said is not quite right.

896
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Sorry.

897
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
If it's along...

898
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't like the mark.

899
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So if it's like this on the left,

900
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
if we draw a line along this purple line,

901
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
let's just say

902
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
we draw a line along the purple line.

903
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You should see two very high peaks.

904
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Then next to it is e-catechumen.

905
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Then near the yellow part

906
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
there will be two very high blue peaks.

907
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Then there will be a very large peak in the middle

908
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
which is yellow.

909
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So when you draw this plot along this surface,

910
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
you will see that

911
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
all three proteins are on this surface.

912
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Then

913
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
if it's like this case,

914
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if it's along this purple line,

915
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you won't see the blue line.

916
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I just want to emphasize

917
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
that the blue one can't

918
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
go to the e-catechumen.

919
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I hope this is clear.

920
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh.

921
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So in wild-type,

922
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
there is no e-catechumen

923
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
near the protocallicin.

924
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes, that's right.

925
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's what I mean.

926
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
OK.

927
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Let's continue.

928
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I just said that the e-catechumen is removed.

929
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
In wild-type, sometimes

930
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
there are very few cells

931
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that can't form an e-catechumen ring.

932
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It can't

933
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
form a ring

934
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
to protect

935
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the area

936
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
that should be protected.

937
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So some cells can't form

938
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
e-catechumen.

939
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So I caught these cells.

940
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I also drew the plot.

941
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So the plot here

942
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
shows the same thing.

943
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
There is a purple area.

944
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If it goes like this,

945
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
there should be protocallicin in that area.

946
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But now the purple area

947
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
occupies the yellow area.

948
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So whether or not

949
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
the e-catechumen

950
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
can form

951
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
an e-catechumen ring,

952
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
in the early stage,

953
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
is a very important thing.

954
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But in the later stage,

955
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
when it grows into a large cyst,

956
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
it has e-catechumen, for sure.

957
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But in the early stage,

958
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
the mechanism of e-catechumen

959
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
is different from that of wild-type.

960
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So how does it form e-catechumen in the later stage

961
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
is actually quite interesting.

962
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We also want to look at this.

963
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This is the result

964
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I have obtained

965
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
for this mapping so far.

966
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I haven't collected a lot of data yet,

967
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
but I should be able to

968
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
collect some results later.

969
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Another thing I want to

970
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
discuss today

971
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
is that

972
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I just said that

973
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
the entire e-catechumen

974
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
is a sphere.

975
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So e-catechumen is like a magnet,

976
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
with a ring around it.

977
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
In the process of opening the entire e-catechumen,

978
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
we are curious about

979
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
how it opens.

980
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So I took a picture of

981
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
this e-catechumen in two cells.

982
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It's like a cell on the outside of the screen

983
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and a cell behind the screen.

984
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The ring of this e-catechumen

985
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
is a bit like

986
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
an oscillation

987
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
in the whole process.

988
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's like a big and small

989
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
oscillation.

990
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So I went to

991
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
quantize its projected area.

992
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
As time went by,

993
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
it did seem to have some oscillation,

994
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
but it wasn't that obvious.

995
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This is what I found recently.

996
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't have a lot of data

997
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to prove that it's really oscillating.

998
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But I checked the reference.

999
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's not in

1000
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
MDCK cells,

1001
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
but in liver cells.

1002
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Someone found

1003
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
a similar oscillation.

1004
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But you can see that

1005
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the time scale in the upper right corner

1006
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
is quite different from the time scale in the lower left corner.

1007
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This may be caused by

1008
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
different cell types.

1009
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But

1010
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
they also found oscillation.

1011
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
They proposed a physical model.

1012
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This oscillation

1013
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
can be grown

1014
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
by three mechanisms.

1015
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The first one is

1016
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
the liquid

1017
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
in it.

1018
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The liquid slowly

1019
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
fills in and grows.

1020
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Because

1021
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
e-catechumen

1022
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
has sealed

1023
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
the entire lumen,

1024
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
it doesn't look like

1025
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
a ball of air.

1026
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
When you fill it in,

1027
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
it slowly grows.

1028
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Another mechanism

1029
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
is to shrink the lumen.

1030
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Why?

1031
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Because each cell

1032
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
wants to

1033
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
get farther and farther.

1034
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If the entire cell

1035
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
is spherical,

1036
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it has the lowest energy.

1037
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So there's a mechanism

1038
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
to shrink the lumen.

1039
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This is the

1040
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
contracellular cortex.

1041
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Lateral adhesions

1042
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
outside the lumen

1043
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
constantly

1044
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
want to

1045
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
increase the connection

1046
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
between the cells.

1047
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
They want to

1048
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
clear the lumen.

1049
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
These three mechanisms

1050
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
cause the oscillation.

1051
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But it's not.

1052
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
These three mechanisms

1053
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
don't cause the oscillation.

1054
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
There's an active term

1055
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
which is the shrinkage

1056
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
of the cortex.

1057
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's a function of time.

1058
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Because the lumen grows,

1059
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
it becomes stronger.

1060
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It causes the oscillation.

1061
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I

1062
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
personally

1063
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
don't have

1064
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
100% sure about this.

1065
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So

1066
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
we propose another hypothesis.

1067
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's not about

1068
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
the size of the lumen.

1069
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's about

1070
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
whether the cortex looks good or not.

1071
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
This is our hypothesis.

1072
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It needs to be verified.

1073
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But I think

1074
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
it's possible.

1075
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The next

1076
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
case is

1077
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I think

1078
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I should

1079
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
finish this first.

1080
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, no. Let me

1081
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
look back.

1082
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I think it's related to the cortex.

1083
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
One of the reasons is

1084
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Sorry.

1085
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
OK.

1086
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
If we

1087
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
look at a cyst,

1088
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
it looks like a sphere.

1089
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
When there's or not a cortex,

1090
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
we find something interesting.

1091
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a cyst with a cortex.

1092
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I label it as

1093
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
P-myosin.

1094
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
P-myosin is a motor protein

1095
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
that makes the cortex shrink.

1096
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So you can see

1097
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
it doesn't have a strong motor protein.

1098
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's only on the outside.

1099
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But if we remove the cortex,

1100
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
you can see the whole cell

1101
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
has a strong cortex.

1102
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It makes us think

1103
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
whether there's a cortex

1104
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
is related to the cortex.

1105
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's not confirmed.

1106
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's not confirmed, but it's not true.

1107
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's just my guess.

1108
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
At the beginning,

1109
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I used green to represent

1110
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
P-myosin and red to represent

1111
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
P-myosin.

1112
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
P-myosin is a certain density.

1113
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's a certain density

1114
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
around the P-myosin.

1115
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Because there's a lot of

1116
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Because there's a lot of

1117
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
contract R4 in the next two cells,

1118
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I hope I can reduce the Rumer.

1119
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Because there's a certain magnitude

1120
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
of the contract R4.

1121
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Then, because these

1122
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
epico-dom, epico-membrane, epico-dom,

1123
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
epico-component are all being thrown

1124
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
to this place.

1125
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Because of physicality, the more molecules,

1126
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
they naturally want to expand.

1127
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
At the same time, P-myosin

1128
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
did not supplement in time.

1129
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The whole is a sphere.

1130
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So you can see the local P-myosin

1131
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
density is decreasing.

1132
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Because of this decline,

1133
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
then, at the same time,

1134
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
it's like this.

1135
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
In the whole Lumen growing process,

1136
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
it's like this.

1137
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This is my personal guess.

1138
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I haven't verified it yet.

1139
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I currently have a simple experiment

1140
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
to prove that

1141
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
it's actually

1142
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
contract R4 and

1143
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
P-myosin interplay,

1144
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
not pressure or other mechanisms.

1145
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Because I added

1146
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
a certain kind of medicine to the cell.

1147
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The medicine will reduce

1148
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
the contract R4,

1149
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
the contractility between the cells.

1150
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What I see here is

1151
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
this P-myosin ring did not grow

1152
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
without contract R4.

1153
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
If it is pressure,

1154
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
it should grow automatically

1155
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
because there is no force pulling it back.

1156
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So it can be seen that P-myosin

1157
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
really confined the whole Lumen.

1158
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So I think

1159
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
it's not very clear.

1160
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But this is my guess.

1161
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
OK.

1162
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
To sum up today's summary,

1163
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
the first thing is

1164
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
from my mapping,

1165
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
my idea is that P-myosin

1166
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
at the stage of two cells,

1167
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
it preserves the space

1168
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
where Lumen is produced.

1169
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So it can produce Lumen later.

1170
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Next,

1171
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
if there is no P-myosin,

1172
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
it does not affect

1173
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
whether EpicoComponent can be thrown into the interface,

1174
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
but whether it can be fused

1175
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
to the membrane.

1176
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The third thing is

1177
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
it will cause the dynamics

1178
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
of the whole Lumen,

1179
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
which is an oscillation.

1180
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Whether it grows well

1181
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
or not depends on

1182
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the interplay between

1183
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
EpicoComponent and P-myosin.

1184
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
OK. This is my lab.

1185
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Let me introduce it to you.

1186
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I have two labs.

1187
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
If there is a result,

1188
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
we hope to build a physical model

1189
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
for the two labs.

1190
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The lab on the left is my lab.

1191
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The lab on the right is my lab.

1192
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I have two bosses.

1193
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
We have this special program.

1194
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You will have two teachers.

1195
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
They both

1196
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
belong to MPI,

1197
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
but they work in

1198
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
different fields.

1199
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Time and computational modeling,

1200
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
or time and image processing.

1201
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
We have such a program.

1202
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So here,

1203
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
we are very close.

1204
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
If you are interested in

1205
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
my institute or have any questions,

1206
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
my email is

1207
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
chwng6601 gmail.com.

1208
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You can contact me.

1209
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
OK.

1210
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
These are my three institutes.

1211
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The yellow one is my boss.

1212
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The middle one is my institute.

1213
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
The right one is my school.

1214
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
OK.

1215
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Thank you.

1216
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
OK.

1217
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Before we start,

1218
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
let's applaud

1219
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and thank our speaker

1220
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
for his wonderful speech.

1221
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Thank you.

1222
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Let's start

1223
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
the Q&A.

1224
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Hello.

1225
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Hi.

1226
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm Adam.

1227
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I have a question.

1228
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
There are different

1229
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
size of lumen

1230
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
in human or mammal.

1231
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What you do is

1232
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
renal.

1233
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I want to ask

1234
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
if there is any comparison

1235
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
between ZO1 in

1236
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
vascular or renal

1237
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
or various lumen

1238
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
epithelial cell expression level.

1239
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
ZO1 seems to

1240
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
regulate the size of lumen.

1241
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Right?

1242
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Personally,

1243
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I don't do this comparison.

1244
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But it's difficult

1245
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
to do this.

1246
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
If you know ZO1,

1247
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you know it's not only in junction.

1248
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
There are many cytoplasmic cells.

1249
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
In my experiment,

1250
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
it's like this.

1251
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
If you want to take out a single cell

1252
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and run a gene or something,

1253
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
it's a little bit

1254
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
inaccurate.

1255
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
What we are doing now

1256
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
is adding ZO1

1257
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
with click chemistry.

1258
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It's a detail.

1259
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
We add a tag on ZO1.

1260
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The tag will be connected by some molecules.

1261
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
We connect all ZO1

1262
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
in the cell,

1263
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
even ZO1 on the membrane.

1264
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Then we can see the result.

1265
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But we don't do it in other species.

1266
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
OK. I see.

1267
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm just curious.

1268
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
If you are

1269
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
over-express ZO1

1270
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
in MDCK,

1271
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
what will it look like?

1272
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
If it's

1273
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
a normal amount,

1274
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
you can imagine

1275
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
it's a football.

1276
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
ZO1

1277
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
along the lumen

1278
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
is like a football.

1279
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
If it's a normal amount,

1280
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
you can see it's a little bit straight and crooked.

1281
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But if you over-express it,

1282
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
you can see it's very crooked.

1283
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's like

1284
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
a very strong confine.

1285
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
That's what I think.

1286
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But it's true.

1287
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
OK. Thank you.

1288
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Any other questions?

1289
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
OK.

1290
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You can think about

1291
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
any other questions.

1292
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
OK.

1293
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If you want to know

1294
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
what Project Tyra is doing,

1295
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I believe

1296
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
if I'm not wrong,

1297
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
you all saw the Facebook announcement

1298
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
and joined today's talk.

1299
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Tyra actually has a website.

1300
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You can see the link

1301
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
of Tyra's website

1302
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
under the announcement.

1303
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And how to join

1304
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Tyra as a member.

1305
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Or if you want to share your research,

1306
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
or

1307
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
what Tyra's ultimate goal is, etc.

1308
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
If you're interested, you can check it out.

1309
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'll ask one more time.

1310
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Any other questions?

1311
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
If there are no questions,

1312
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
let's give a round of applause

1313
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
to thank Chen He for his wonderful talk.

1314
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Thank you.

1315
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Thank you.

1316
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm going to stop recording.
