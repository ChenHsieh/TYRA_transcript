Thank you everyone for participating in this talk, this time we are very happy to invite Dr. Wu Qixing,
Dr. Wu Qixing is currently the director of psychiatry at NTU Hospital,
he has a PhD and MD degree, his doctorate was obtained from NTU's Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine.
He is currently doing research at Harvard Medical School,
I am very happy that he can bring a medical research that everyone cares about,
how to use machine learning to help us make breakthroughs in personalized psychiatric diagnosis.
Please give a round of applause to welcome Dr. Wu.
Thank you everyone, I am very happy to have this opportunity to come here today to explain the results of the research.
Because the results of this research have not been officially released, the follow-up recording will probably be released to everyone in about half a year.
I graduated from medical school and got a doctorate in epidemiology,
but later I found out that the field of machine learning is actually quite important,
so this year I had the opportunity to come to Harvard University to study further.
I think everyone is very clear about the mental illness, especially the recent public television program,
the distance between us and evil, this drama received a lot of response.
Friends overseas may not necessarily be able to see this drama,
but in Taiwan, in fact, this drama has caused quite a lot of response.
We can see that the main character, Yin Sichong,
this patient is actually a young man,
but because of his illness, we can see that he seems to have become bald and no beard,
and because he was quite excited, he was tied to the bed with his limbs restrained.
So this is when you get a relatively serious mental illness,
he may face a change in his whole life.
Originally, he may be like us, a young man studying and learning,
but because of his illness, he interrupted the whole learning process.
If everyone's age is similar to mine, you may remember this movie called Beauty and the Beast.
It talks about the process of American mathematician John Nash.
He was also a very smart person, but when he was young, he had a visual impairment,
so his entire academic career was interrupted for a while.
This movie and book can be seen.
So the main disease I'm talking about today is probably schizophrenia.
In Chinese, it means a visual impairment.
His past name was schizophrenia.
But because of this name, there was some misunderstanding,
so it was later changed to a visual impairment.
This disease is mainly studied for two reasons.
The first is that it is the most serious mental illness.
The second is that this disease itself,
we think it is a biological disease,
not because of a psychological defect or a psychological problem,
but because the brain is sick due to this disease.
The expression of this disease itself is that there are some delusions,
such as that someone wants to harm me,
and then some people will have some hallucinations.
Obviously there is no sound next to him, but he keeps hearing someone talking to him,
and he keeps hearing a lot of sounds.
Or when the whole brain is in a mess,
he will have some lost language and behavior,
and he will stammer, speechless, and so on.
There are also some so-called negative symptoms.
For example, if an ordinary person is locked in a room without a book or a computer,
he may feel bored soon.
But when the negative symptoms are more serious,
he will become uninterested in everything and don't want to do anything.
You may just want to stare blankly,
and then slowly become less and less words and less and less expressions.
This is the so-called negative symptoms.
The vitality that ordinary people have,
the things they want to do will slowly disappear.
This is the negative symptom.
Generally speaking, the diagnosis of negative symptoms
is to make a diagnosis based on these statements.
The probability of survival is about 1% in the whole population.
The probability of survival is about 1% in the whole world.
So we think this is a disease of the brain.
It won't have too much impact because of cultural differences.
For such a disease,
in fact, we should choose the so-called antipsychotic treatment.
We will use this antipsychotic drug for treatment.
There are two meanings of this treatment.
One is the control of symptoms.
When your brain has a lot of delusions and hallucinations,
we need to rely on this drug to let our delusions and hallucinations
be under control.
When the symptoms get better,
in fact, we still have to take medicine.
What we need to do is relapse prevention,
which is to prevent relapse.
In some past studies,
people who stop taking medicine,
compared to those who continue to take medicine,
the chance of relapse is about five times.
So whether or not to continue taking medicine is actually quite important.
In some past therapeutic studies,
it was found that most people,
as long as they take medicine well at the beginning,
about 6% of the symptoms can be significantly improved.
But when you follow it for a longer time,
you will find that
in fact, people with three to seven layers
need to change the medicine in the middle,
or they will stop the treatment.
There will be this situation within a year.
Either the drug has no effect,
or they feel that the drug has some side effects
and they can't accept it,
or this group of people
lacks the sense of illness.
They think,
I'm fine, I'm not sick,
I don't want to take medicine anymore.
So this is a process that causes a lot of people to stop
or change their medicine.
Once you stop the medicine,
it's easy to relapse.
Once relapsed,
the effect of the treatment is not so good.
So in fact, these people
often relapse slowly,
and then slowly become a chronic disease.
So in a long-term follow-up study,
it was found that
less than 30% of people
can recover to normal function,
can complete their studies,
and can go to work.
For most people,
the chance of getting this disease is about 70% or 80% or more.
In fact, it becomes that there is no ability to work.
So these people,
in fact, a lot of people
need to go through a rehabilitation process in the later stage.
Because their function is degenerated,
they can't work,
they can't study,
so they probably need to be in some nursing factories
or in some intensive care units
to slowly do some rehabilitation,
so that they can
re-learn the ability to live.
So once you get this disease,
if you don't treat it well at the beginning,
in fact, the aftermath is quite bad.
In terms of drugs,
in fact, in such drugs,
in Taiwan,
there are about 20 kinds of drugs,
but if you look at the whole world,
there are about 40 kinds.
This is a simple structure
chemical history.
Then we can know that
in fact, these drugs themselves
have a big difference.
Then they use this
according to the Neurotransmitter Affinity
to look at their pharmacological properties.
You can also see that
like these drugs,
in fact, they are in
different neurotransmitter substances
play different roles.
Some are for dopamine,
there is a very strong Mycin Affinity,
but in fact, some are weaker.
Instead, it is for other
serotonin,
polypinephrine,
there are some Mycin Affinity.
So in fact,
these drugs themselves
have a big difference in their pharmacological properties.
There are so many kinds of drugs.
In fact, in clinical trials,
we will probably divide these drugs
into two categories.
The first category is the first generation of drugs,
which is the drug developed
from the 1950s.
The second generation is probably around 1970-1980,
a drug that slowly emerged.
Approximately,
it has been around for about 30 years.
The first generation of drugs,
in fact, the drug at the beginning
was found to be a more misdiagnosed drug.
These drugs also have
more side effects on neurotransmitter.
For example,
it will become stiff all the time,
tremble,
or even long-term side effects,
there will be so-called
tardive kinesia,
which is when the whole body becomes
involuntarily slow to move.
The body will bend one side,
the mouth will bend one side.
So the long-term results of taking medicine
will be more troublesome
and difficult to treat.
In addition, these drugs
will also have so-called more tardive kinesia,
or cause heart rate disorder,
as well as a rapid rise in myeloma.
There will be a lot of
problems with myeloma
and myocardial infarction.
The second generation of drugs,
in fact,
because the first generation of drugs
has a lot of problems,
so they went to do some
modern development,
and began to see if we could
reduce the side effects of this drug.
So at this time,
they began to reduce
the side effects of myocardial infarction.
So they mainly started to do some development.
This is the first drug of the second generation.
But this drug, in fact,
was only listed in the United States
after a few years.
It is mainly said that
it has some serious side effects
that cause a decrease in body immunity.
So these drugs
become, although there are,
but not so easy to use.
But slowly,
following this second generation of drugs,
to do some new eyes,
slowly new,
better and better second-generation drugs began.
But these second-generation drugs
will also produce some
other side effects,
such as weight gain,
increase the risk of myocardial infarction.
So these drugs look like
there are some quite different,
but there is one good,
there is no good,
so each has its own
effect and side effects.
So how to choose so many drugs?
In fact,
some people's efforts are to say,
hey,
is it possible for me to find
a best drug to see?
If everyone uses
the best drug to treat first,
then if there is no effect,
then use the second best drug.
Is this possible to achieve
the best effect?
So in fact,
some people do a lot of
so-called meta-analysis.
They collected more than 500
randomized control trials
to do an analysis.
Found that the best medicine
is what we just talked about,
the drug that has a lot of side effects,
colazapine, this drug.
Then the second generation of drugs,
the next drug,
there are also drugs such as
adminsupiride,
olanzapine, etc.
It can be arranged like this.
But in fact,
it's not that simple.
Because in fact,
a drug itself,
in addition to this effect,
it also has the so-called side effects.
In fact,
the arrangement of side effects
is completely different.
For example,
the problem of weight gain.
In fact,
for side effects,
the higher the better,
the lower the worse.
For example,
olanzapine
is originally a drug that
has a good effect,
but in this part of weight gain,
it becomes a
side effect.
It's a pretty big problem.
Or,
this causes
the side effects of glycogen.
This colazapine,
this drug,
has almost no side effects
of glycogen.
But other drugs
have a lot of side effects
of glycogen.
So if we arrange it,
in fact,
we can't find
a perfect drug.
Its effect is also very good.
The side effects are also very good.
In fact, it can't be found.
In fact,
these arrangements
are actually
a lot of variables.
These variables are quite complicated.
So in fact,
the side effects we need to pay attention to
in clinical trials,
may be six or seven
side effects.
There are 20 kinds of drugs,
20 kinds of drugs.
Each condition is different.
Their side effects
are also
some differences in fiber.
It's not obvious,
but there are some
differences in fiber.
In addition,
each patient's characteristics are different.
For example,
a middle-aged man
may not care
so much
about weight gain.
But if you say
the subject of your treatment
is a young woman,
weight gain
is a side effect
that he can't accept.
Or,
a person himself
already has some
cardiovascular problems.
If this drug
increases his
heart rate
or cardiovascular risk,
in fact,
this drug
is obviously
unsuitable for him.
In addition,
the metabolism of this drug
is the same.
Some are
the liver metabolism
and some are
the kidney metabolism.
So you need to
use his liver function
to make
drug adjustments
and treatments.
In fact,
there are too many
things to consider.
But in clinical trials,
each doctor's experience
is not so much.
So in fact,
it's hard for us
to find a good
predictability
in clinical trials.
So for most doctors,
it's probably
that I may
make a choice
based on these points
that I think are
more important.
In fact,
will this choice
be successful?
To be honest,
we don't have much
confidence in our hearts.
So we often say
try it first.
So sometimes
we have
some ideas
and reasons,
but will it
happen like this?
In fact,
we don't have much confidence.
So this is
a very important
thing in
personal medical care.
We have no way
to know
what kind of person
is most suitable for
what kind of drug
and find out
such a rule.
So this is
a direction
that everyone
is working on
at the moment.
So there are
so many kinds of people.
How do we
choose the
best drug
according to
each person?
We started
to learn
machine learning
mainly in
2016.
This is the
encouragement
of AlphaGo.
As we all know,
in fact,
we can
use the
developed
computer
to defeat
the world's
top players.
So this is
the story
of AlphaGo.
In fact,
many people
are encouraged
by it.
So in
all fields,
we hope to
use
machine learning.
So our
current problem
is that
we have no way
to say
that we just
know that
there are
many different
characteristics
in the
human brain
.
In fact,
there are
too many variables
that our
brain can't
learn.
Can we
use
machine learning
to achieve
the goal
of personalized
medicine?
This is
a direction
we want to
discuss.
In fact,
there are
more and more
medical applications
for machine
learning.
On the
one hand,
we know that
MRI
has a
fairly good
ability.
In fact,
there is a
lot of progress
in imaging
processing.
So the
most used
is still
our
imaging
checkup,
such as
X-ray,
computer
CT,
or
MRI.
These
are actually
using
machine
learning to
help
our diagnosis.
The speed
of
imaging
and
machine
learning
is also
able to
achieve
this level.
So
the most
developed
is to
assist
doctors
in
diagnosis.
On the
other
hand,
we know
that
machine
learning
can
determine
which
type it
is.
So
the
ability
of
imaging
is
better
than
the
past.
Some
people
use it
to
predict
whether
a person
is
sick,
or
to
predict
the
effect of
treatment.
So
this is
what we
want to
do.
We
hope that
people with
the same
medical
care
can
benefit
each
other.
This
is the
goal
of
personalized
and
precision
medical
care.
So
many people
know
about
machine
learning,
but
I only
started
learning
about
machine
learning.
So
we
are
learning
in different
ways.
For
example,
when we
learn how
to identify
plants,
we
see
a lot
of
plants,
and
the
teacher
will
tell
us
the
rules.
And
we
can
find
apples.
In
the past,
we
used
this
method
to
find
apples.
But
when we
were
raising kids,
we
realized
that
learning
wasn't
really
about
learning.
So
we
told
him
the
rules
of
learning.
For
example,
we
told him
the
colors of
apples,
but
he
would
know
which
one
was
the
apple.
So
this
is
the
essence
of
machine
learning.
There
are a
lot of
theories behind
this.
But
generally,
we can
divide it
into
dozens
of
categories.
For
example,
I'll
skip
these
categories
first.
We'll
talk about
them
later.
But
for now,
deep
learning
is
about
whether
it's
useful
in
epidemiology.
We
don't
know.
So
we
don't
know
whether
it's
useful
in
epidemiology.
So
machine
learning
is
not
just
about
learning.
Some
people
think
it's
about
whether
it's
useful
in
epidemiology.
So
we'll
use
a lot
of
decision
making
methods.
For
example,
we'll
vote
to see
if it
works.
This
is
called
vegging.
Some
methods are
boosting.
This
is a
concept.
Some
are
staking.
We
use different
learning
methods.
For
example,
simple
memorization,
written
forest,
or
machine
learning.
We
do
a
second
learning
to see
if it
works
better than
the
first
learning.
So
staking is
like
the guardian.
Everyone has
different
special
functions.
But
it's
basically
a very
strong
team.
So
for now,
staking
is not
certain,
but
the
final
results
are
probably
better than
the
first
learning.
We
use
different
methods
and
theories.
But
where does
the data
come from?
In
Taiwan,
we have
a few
large
data
that
we can
use.
The
most
common
is
the
health
care
database.
So
if I
don't
see a
doctor,
they
won't
tell me
how much
I weigh,
unless
I see
a doctor.
So
the
data
is not
that
complete.
There
are
other
important
data.
For
example,
I
don't
smoke,
so
I
don't
eat
anything.
So
the
data
is
not
that
complete.
So
the
data
is not
that
complete.
The
data
is not
that
complete.
So
we
don't
use
that a
lot.
So
I
don't
eat
anything.
So
the
data
is not
that
complete.
So
we
don't
eat
anything.
So
we
don't
eat
anything.
So
the
data
is not

So
