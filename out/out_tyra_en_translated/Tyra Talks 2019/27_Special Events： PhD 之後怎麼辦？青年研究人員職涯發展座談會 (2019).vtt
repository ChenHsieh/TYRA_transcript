00:00.000 --> 00:11.720
Hello everyone, good morning, good afternoon or good evening. I am in California now, so I am very early now. Welcome to today's TerraTalk.

00:11.720 --> 00:28.320
If you have participated in TerraTalk, you will know that we actually have an academic speech every week. The academic speech is actually for all our members to come up and share their research progress, but we are more special today, so there are more people.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.940
Our topic today is what to do after Ph.D.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.860
Youth Researchers Post-Graduate Development Conference

00:36.420 --> 00:39.180
I will say it again, what to do after Ph.D.

00:39.180 --> 00:41.820
Youth Researchers Post-Graduate Development Conference

00:42.000 --> 00:46.980
Today is not a single speaker's speech.

00:47.400 --> 01:01.940
The three speakers we mentioned today are Dr. Zhang Mujie, Dr. Zhou Yuxun, and Dr. Su Haowei. They are now distributed around the world in Taiwan, Israel, and Boston, USA, so they are also distributed in various cities.

01:01.940 --> 01:10.400
Come and share with us that they are looking for their teeth, this change, and the new path of different positions now.

01:10.700 --> 01:17.200
Let's not say much, let's invite the three speakers to introduce themselves separately.

01:19.440 --> 01:25.000
At the beginning, I will use the name first, so that everyone does not know who to start with.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.500
Can we first ask Mujie to introduce himself?

01:30.780 --> 01:37.600
Hello everyone, I am Zhang Mujie, and I am now a assistant professor at the University of Taiwan's Department of Chemistry.

01:37.600 --> 01:52.940
I returned to NTU in August last year, so it's been about a year, so if you have any questions, especially those related to Taiwan, you are welcome to ask.

01:55.760 --> 02:02.500
Can you talk about your university, master's degree, and doctoral degree?

02:02.500 --> 02:12.260
My university and research institute are both in NTU Department of Chemistry, and after I graduated from my master's degree, I worked as a research assistant for a little over a year.

02:12.260 --> 02:28.400
Then I went to the University of Hollingham in the Netherlands to study for my doctorate, and after graduating from my doctorate in 2016, I went to Chicago University in the United States to do post-doctoral research, and came back in 2018.

02:28.400 --> 02:37.360
So I did post-doctoral research for about two years, a little more than two years, and that's about it.

02:37.700 --> 02:43.720
OK, let's ask Haowei to introduce himself.

02:45.160 --> 03:04.240
Hello everyone, my name is Su Haowei, and I am now at Fitbit in Boston. We are a company that makes wearable devices called Fitbit, and I have been working here for about four years, and I have been in Boston for almost nine years.

03:04.640 --> 03:15.840
I studied in Taiwan when I was in college, and then I came to the United States to study for my master's degree after I graduated from my doctorate, and then I stayed to work after I finished my studies.

03:16.720 --> 03:39.200
In the field of work, I studied imaging in college, such as ultrasound and MRI, and then came here to do research in microfluidics. Now I mainly write algorithms and do some human experiments at work.

03:39.520 --> 03:54.960
A small question, so you said that you have been in this company for about four years, and you have been in Fitbit for four years, but you have been there for almost ten years, right? So basically your PhD is in the best school in the world, is that right?

03:55.280 --> 04:02.240
Yes, because I am talking about this from Caltech now, so I think it should be quite persuasive.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.120
Don't be in school, don't be in school, really the best school.

04:07.120 --> 04:21.440
Okay, so today we have three speakers, and Hao Wei is one of them in the industry. So if you have any questions about the industry, or want to go to the industry in the future, or want to do more applications, you can also ask questions.

04:21.440 --> 04:26.000
Thank you, Hao Wei. Next, Yuxun, please speak.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
I am completing my PhD.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
It is a marriage proposal.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I am doing research in Israel.

05:22.000 --> 05:34.000
Sorry, I am interrupting, because it seems like a lot of people can't hear Yuxun's voice.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I am not sure if Yanyong can hear you.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I can hear a little bit.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
I can't hear you well here, and sometimes there is no sound at all, and sometimes there is a little bit.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.560
Let me turn up the battery.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.560
Can you hear me now?

05:54.560 --> 05:56.560
Yes, I can hear you well now.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.560
That's good.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.560
Okay, let me quickly introduce myself.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.560
I am an assistant professor at Caltech.

06:02.560 --> 06:10.560
I finished my master's degree in physics at Caltech, and then I went to the National University of Transportation to do my research on nanoparticles.

06:11.120 --> 06:21.120
After I finished my research, I went to the University of Michigan to do some physics-related research.

06:23.120 --> 06:29.120
During this year and a half, I was very lucky to have a chance to go to Israel to do my research.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.120
I got a fellowship and went to Israel to do my research.

06:33.120 --> 06:37.120
During this time, I tried to join the so-called Einstein Project.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.680
I was very lucky to get this project.

06:41.680 --> 06:49.680
So today, I would like to share some details and skills needed to apply for the Einstein Project.

06:49.680 --> 06:59.680
Also, I would like to share with my friends who are currently studying for a doctorate, what preparations they need to make in order to have a higher application rate for this project in the future.

07:00.240 --> 07:06.240
Okay, so today...

07:06.240 --> 07:08.240
Sorry, let me take a look.

07:08.240 --> 07:16.240
So today, Yu-Hsuan will basically answer your questions about the process of applying for the Einstein Project and returning to Taiwan.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.240
In fact, we have another speaker who has also applied for the Einstein Project.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.240
So there should be different opinions, which you can discuss later.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.240
Okay, give me a second.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.800
I just opened a file and turned it off.

07:30.800 --> 07:36.800
Okay, do you have any questions for the speaker about their background?

07:38.800 --> 07:44.800
Is there anything you want to ask or would like to know more about?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.800
Okay, so...

07:49.360 --> 07:53.360
Hey, did you play in the e-sports scene before?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.360
Yes, I did.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.360
I think I know you.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.360
Oh, really?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.360
Yes, yes, yes.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.360
I used to be in the e-sports scene.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.360
I think you played in the e-sports scene for a year or two.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.360
Or was it after Star Cup?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.360
Yes, I played Star Cup for 30 seconds.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.360
Just like Lin Shuhao.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.360
No, no, no.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.360
Impressive, impressive.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.920
Okay, okay, okay.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.920
Let's continue our serious discussion.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.920
Okay.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.920
The person I just talked to is Ted.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.920
He works at Tokyo University as a quantum computer scientist.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.920
Okay, let's get straight to our first question of the day.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.920
I'd like to ask the three speakers to briefly summarize

08:35.920 --> 08:39.920
their journey from starting to studying for a doctorate

08:39.920 --> 08:41.920
to studying for a doctorate.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.480
After finishing the doctorate,

08:44.480 --> 08:46.480
they now work in different jobs.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.480
What are their plans for the future?

08:48.480 --> 08:50.480
What are their thoughts?

08:50.480 --> 08:52.480
And what are the actual changes

08:52.480 --> 08:54.480
that they've encountered?

08:54.480 --> 08:56.480
What is the process like?

08:56.480 --> 08:58.480
Let's change the order.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.480
Why don't we start with Yuxun?

09:00.480 --> 09:02.480
Okay.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
Okay.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.480
Because...

09:06.480 --> 09:08.480
Okay.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.480
So...

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
Um...

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
Let me share my screen.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
Okay.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
Can you see my screen?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
Yes, I can.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
So, basically,

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
I've already introduced myself

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
as a student.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
So, I won't go into details here.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
Um...

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
I have a passion for science.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.040
But, um...

09:39.600 --> 09:41.600
It's like this quote.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
I think the world is full of wonderful things

09:43.600 --> 09:45.600
that you can explore.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
But you need to have enough wisdom

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
to discover them.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.600
This so-called enough wisdom

09:51.600 --> 09:53.600
is actually my personal interpretation.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.600
If you want to do anything,

09:55.600 --> 09:57.600
you have to start over.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
That's right.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.600
But you have to know how to do it.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.600
So, why do I say you have to know how to do it?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.600
At the moment,

10:05.600 --> 10:07.600
it's very difficult

10:08.160 --> 10:10.160
to be a researcher.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.160
If you are passionate about research,

10:12.160 --> 10:14.160
your first goal must be teaching.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.160
But, in reality,

10:16.160 --> 10:18.160
I'm not very determined

10:18.160 --> 10:20.160
to be a teacher.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.160
So,

10:22.160 --> 10:24.160
during my studies,

10:24.160 --> 10:26.160
apart from

10:26.160 --> 10:28.160
attending some academic activities,

10:28.160 --> 10:30.160
I also often attend

10:30.160 --> 10:32.160
some vocational lectures

10:32.160 --> 10:34.160
and even some

10:34.160 --> 10:36.160
vocational talks.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.720
At the same time,

10:38.720 --> 10:40.720
I also check out

10:40.720 --> 10:42.720
some talent recruitment websites

10:42.720 --> 10:44.720
like LinkedIn

10:44.720 --> 10:46.720
or 104,

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
which are often used in Taiwan.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.720
I check out

10:50.720 --> 10:52.720
the relevant knowledge

10:52.720 --> 10:54.720
that I've learned

10:54.720 --> 10:56.720
in the current mainstream companies.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.720
Do they need talents like me?

10:58.720 --> 11:00.720
If they do,

11:00.720 --> 11:02.720
what skills do they need?

11:02.720 --> 11:04.720
So, I occasionally spend some time

11:05.280 --> 11:07.280
learning from them.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.280
Of course,

11:09.280 --> 11:11.280
my life went quite well

11:11.280 --> 11:13.280
as I expected.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.280
So,

11:15.280 --> 11:17.280
when it comes to

11:17.280 --> 11:19.280
interviews in the industry

11:19.280 --> 11:21.280
or

11:21.280 --> 11:23.280
working in the industry,

11:23.280 --> 11:25.280
I can't share too much.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.280
So,

11:27.280 --> 11:29.280
I'll leave this part

11:29.280 --> 11:31.280
to the two of you

11:31.280 --> 11:33.280
to share your experiences.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
So,

11:35.840 --> 11:37.840
my major is

11:37.840 --> 11:39.840
nanoradiation

11:39.840 --> 11:41.840
or semiconductor radiation.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
So,

11:43.840 --> 11:45.840
for me,

11:45.840 --> 11:47.840
if I want to

11:47.840 --> 11:49.840
become an excellent researcher,

11:49.840 --> 11:51.840
I must have two identities at the same time.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.840
One is a good teacher.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.840
Why should I become a good teacher?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.840
Because I must

11:57.840 --> 11:59.840
take the knowledge

11:59.840 --> 12:01.840
I've learned

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
and pass it on

12:04.400 --> 12:06.400
to the next

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
students

12:08.400 --> 12:10.400
or those

12:10.400 --> 12:12.400
who join this field later.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
In addition,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
I must also be

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
a good scientist.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
If I become a good scientist,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
I can get a privilege

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
that I can know

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
the secret of the universe

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
earlier than others.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
Then, I can study it thoroughly

12:30.960 --> 12:32.960
and try to manipulate

12:32.960 --> 12:34.960
these physical or scientific phenomena.

12:34.960 --> 12:36.960
I feel excited

12:36.960 --> 12:38.960
about this.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
So,

12:40.960 --> 12:42.960
my first goal in life

12:42.960 --> 12:44.960
is to become a researcher.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.960
So, I spend most of my energy

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
on research.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.960
My goal in life

12:50.960 --> 12:52.960
is to create a good

12:52.960 --> 12:54.960
research environment

12:54.960 --> 12:56.960
for all excellent students

12:56.960 --> 12:58.960
to join my lab

12:59.520 --> 13:01.520
and conduct cutting-edge research.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.520
I want to apply these cutting-edge research

13:03.520 --> 13:05.520
to the world

13:05.520 --> 13:07.520
and the human race.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.520
In other words,

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
I want to benefit the human race.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.520
It sounds like a lot of nonsense,

13:13.520 --> 13:15.520
but this is what I thought

13:15.520 --> 13:17.520
when I was in high school.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.520
So,

13:19.520 --> 13:21.520
my personal

13:21.520 --> 13:23.520
job search is going well

13:23.520 --> 13:25.520
and I focus on the academic field.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.520
So, let me make it short.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.080
When I was a student,

13:30.080 --> 13:32.080
I focused on

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
academic development.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.080
So,

13:36.080 --> 13:38.080
I focused on

13:38.080 --> 13:40.080
academic development.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.080
When I was in the lab,

13:42.080 --> 13:44.080
I focused on

13:44.080 --> 13:46.080
receiving awards

13:46.080 --> 13:48.080
such as

13:48.080 --> 13:50.080
a book award

13:50.080 --> 13:52.080
or

13:52.080 --> 13:54.080
a research paper award

13:54.080 --> 13:56.080
or

13:56.640 --> 13:58.640
an engineering degree.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.640
In my field,

14:00.640 --> 14:02.640
I joined SPIE

14:02.640 --> 14:04.640
or IEEE Engineering School.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.640
There are some student awards

14:06.640 --> 14:08.640
on the list.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.640
The advantage of joining these schools

14:10.640 --> 14:12.640
is that you can

14:12.640 --> 14:14.640
participate in some academic activities

14:14.640 --> 14:16.640
and try to apply for some academic awards.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.640
These academic awards

14:18.640 --> 14:20.640
will play a very important role

14:20.640 --> 14:22.640
in your future application

14:22.640 --> 14:24.640
for a postdoc

14:25.200 --> 14:27.200
Besides the academic activities,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.200
don't forget that

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
as a researcher,

14:31.200 --> 14:33.200
as a scholar,

14:33.200 --> 14:35.200
one of your most important missions

14:35.200 --> 14:37.200
is to pass on knowledge.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.200
As I mentioned in my last PowerPoint,

14:39.200 --> 14:41.200
it is very important to pass on knowledge.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.200
So, during my postdoc

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
and my PhD,

14:45.200 --> 14:47.200
I spent some of my energy

14:47.200 --> 14:49.200
to train some students

14:49.200 --> 14:51.200
in the Department of University Studies.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
Some of the students

14:53.760 --> 14:55.760
in the Department of University Studies

14:55.760 --> 14:57.760
received

14:57.760 --> 14:59.760
some student awards

14:59.760 --> 15:01.760
at some international conferences.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.760
These student awards

15:03.760 --> 15:05.760
are not only their own achievements,

15:05.760 --> 15:07.760
but also

15:07.760 --> 15:09.760
my guidance

15:09.760 --> 15:11.760
to them.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.760
I can't say it is a guidance,

15:13.760 --> 15:15.760
but it is also

15:15.760 --> 15:17.760
a credit for me.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.760
So, I often hear

15:19.760 --> 15:21.760
that some students

15:22.320 --> 15:24.320
spend a lot of time

15:24.320 --> 15:26.320
on their postdocs

15:26.320 --> 15:28.320
or postdocs.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.320
I think

15:30.320 --> 15:32.320
you need to correct

15:32.320 --> 15:34.320
your thoughts

15:34.320 --> 15:36.320
because the students

15:36.320 --> 15:38.320
who receive these awards

15:38.320 --> 15:40.320
prove that

15:40.320 --> 15:42.320
you have the ability

15:42.320 --> 15:44.320
to lead a team

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
and build a team.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.320
When you write

15:48.320 --> 15:50.320
the Einstein Project,

15:50.880 --> 15:52.880
you have the ability

15:52.880 --> 15:54.880
to build a team.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.880
So, I think

15:56.880 --> 15:58.880
both research and teaching

15:58.880 --> 16:00.880
are very important.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.880
So, I put some effort

16:02.880 --> 16:04.880
into both research

16:04.880 --> 16:06.880
and teaching.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.880
Looking ahead,

16:08.880 --> 16:10.880
what I have done

16:10.880 --> 16:12.880
is meaningful.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.880
These are some of

16:14.880 --> 16:16.880
my thoughts

16:16.880 --> 16:18.880
during my PhD.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.440
I am an academic,

16:21.440 --> 16:23.440
so I can't share

16:23.440 --> 16:25.440
much about the industry.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.440
So, I will end

16:27.440 --> 16:29.440
here.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.440
I feel like I am wasting your time.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.440
No problem.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.440
Thank you.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.440
If you have any questions,

16:37.440 --> 16:39.440
you can type them

16:39.440 --> 16:41.440
in the chat.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.440
We will help you.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.440
If you

16:45.440 --> 16:47.440
want to say something,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
remember to turn on the microphone.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Some people join later.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Next,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
let's welcome Hao Wei.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.440
He is doing a

16:57.440 --> 16:59.440
calculation on Fitbit.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.440
Hi, everyone.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.440
I am Hao Wei.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.440
Now,

17:05.440 --> 17:07.440
should I introduce

17:07.440 --> 17:09.440
my job or

17:09.440 --> 17:11.440
what I thought

17:11.440 --> 17:13.440
during my PhD?

17:13.440 --> 17:15.440
You can start

17:15.440 --> 17:17.440
now.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.440
How did you

17:19.440 --> 17:21.440
decide to

17:21.440 --> 17:23.440
choose this path?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.440
Did you meet

17:25.440 --> 17:27.440
any opportunities?

17:27.440 --> 17:29.440
When I

17:29.440 --> 17:31.440
started my PhD,

17:31.440 --> 17:33.440
I was very happy

17:33.440 --> 17:35.440
when I applied to MIT.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.440
I thought I got a lottery ticket.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
But I didn't know

17:39.440 --> 17:41.440
how to use it.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.440
I asked many professors

17:43.440 --> 17:45.440
what I should do

17:45.440 --> 17:47.440
to become famous.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.440
What kind of professors

17:49.440 --> 17:51.440
should I find?

17:51.440 --> 17:53.440
A professor told me

17:53.440 --> 17:55.440
that the research field

17:55.440 --> 17:57.440
has changed a lot.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.440
You may not be the most famous

17:59.440 --> 18:01.440
when you are studying.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.440
You don't need to pursue it.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.440
I wanted to continue

18:05.440 --> 18:07.440
making videos.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.440
But the professor told me

18:09.440 --> 18:11.440
I should try new things.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.440
I went to

18:13.440 --> 18:15.440
study

18:15.440 --> 18:17.440
bioengineering.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.440
I joined

18:21.440 --> 18:23.440
a lab

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
for stem cell

18:25.440 --> 18:27.440
microfluidics.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.440
My PhD

18:29.440 --> 18:31.440
was a struggle.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.440
I had to learn

18:33.440 --> 18:35.440
new things

18:35.440 --> 18:37.440
that I wasn't familiar with.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.440
I started to raise cells,

18:39.440 --> 18:41.440
kill mice,

18:41.440 --> 18:43.440
and other things

18:43.440 --> 18:45.440
that I wasn't familiar with.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.440
During my PhD,

18:47.440 --> 18:49.440
I learned

18:49.440 --> 18:51.440
about cross-field research.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.440
I learned

18:53.440 --> 18:55.440
how to respect professionals

18:55.440 --> 18:57.440
and how to learn

18:57.440 --> 18:59.440
what they are good at.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.440
In our lab,

19:01.440 --> 19:03.440
there are chemical engineers,

19:03.440 --> 19:05.440
biologists, mechanical engineers,

19:05.440 --> 19:07.440
electrical engineers,

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
and scientists.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.440
Everyone is different.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.440
How can you

19:13.440 --> 19:15.440
understand what others are doing?

19:15.440 --> 19:17.440
Sometimes you can even

19:17.440 --> 19:19.440
talk to them.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.440
During my PhD,

19:21.440 --> 19:23.440
I was happy

19:23.440 --> 19:25.440
to learn

19:25.440 --> 19:27.440
different things.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.440
During my PhD,

19:29.440 --> 19:31.440
there was a postdoc

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
in our lab.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.440
He just started

19:35.440 --> 19:37.440
his PhD.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.440
He did research there.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.440
I thought

19:41.440 --> 19:43.440
this company was interesting.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.440
He thought I was suitable

19:45.440 --> 19:47.440
for that company,

19:47.440 --> 19:49.440
so I became an intern.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.440
If you are not sure

19:51.440 --> 19:53.440
whether you want to

19:53.440 --> 19:55.440
become a student or an intern,

19:55.440 --> 19:57.440
if you have a chance

19:57.440 --> 19:59.440
to explore different opportunities,

19:59.440 --> 20:01.440
it's different to

20:01.440 --> 20:03.440
become an intern.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.440
You get to know the industry.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.440
After you graduate,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.440
your chance to work

20:09.440 --> 20:11.440
in the industry

20:11.440 --> 20:13.440
will increase.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.440
We were lucky

20:15.440 --> 20:17.440
to be an intern

20:17.440 --> 20:19.440
for three months.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.440
It was fun.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.440
After I graduated,

20:23.440 --> 20:25.440
I went back to the company.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
As for

20:27.440 --> 20:29.440
what I am

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
doing now,

20:31.440 --> 20:33.440
there are

20:33.440 --> 20:35.440
many people

20:35.440 --> 20:37.440
from different fields

20:37.440 --> 20:39.440
in our company.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.440
We have sleep technologists,

20:41.440 --> 20:43.440
exercise physiologists,

20:43.440 --> 20:45.440
mechanical and electrical

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
engineers.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.440
What I am doing now

20:49.440 --> 20:51.440
is a team lead.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
I handle a big project

20:53.440 --> 20:55.440
and finish it together.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.440
Yes.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.440
I have a question.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.440
Where should

21:03.440 --> 21:05.440
a student

21:05.440 --> 21:07.440
choose to study?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.440
Or,

21:09.440 --> 21:11.440
where should

21:11.440 --> 21:13.440
a student choose

21:13.440 --> 21:15.440
to study?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.440
For example,

21:17.440 --> 21:19.440
what is the relationship

21:19.440 --> 21:21.440
between the teacher

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
and the community

21:23.440 --> 21:25.440
in the industry?

21:25.440 --> 21:27.440
As far as I know,

21:27.440 --> 21:29.440
biotechnology

21:29.440 --> 21:31.440
is very popular

21:31.440 --> 21:33.440
in Boston.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.440
That's right.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.440
I think it's important.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.440
If you want to

21:39.440 --> 21:41.440
work in the industry,

21:41.440 --> 21:43.440
go to a place with

21:43.440 --> 21:45.440
many companies,

21:45.440 --> 21:47.440
you can easily

21:47.440 --> 21:49.440
get to know

21:49.440 --> 21:51.440
what life is like

21:51.440 --> 21:53.440
in different companies.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.440
In Boston,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.440
we have

21:57.440 --> 21:59.440
a BTBA organization.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.440
We are all Taiwanese

22:01.440 --> 22:03.440
and have a BTBA association.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.440
Many people

22:05.440 --> 22:07.440
work there.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.440
We have an annual conference

22:09.440 --> 22:11.440
to share what we are doing.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.440
I think it's important

22:13.440 --> 22:15.440
to choose a place.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.440
If you are a professor,

22:17.440 --> 22:19.440
you can ask

22:19.440 --> 22:21.440
other professors

22:21.440 --> 22:23.440
or people

22:23.440 --> 22:25.440
in the lab,

22:25.440 --> 22:27.440
even foreigners,

22:27.440 --> 22:29.440
to grab a coffee

22:29.440 --> 22:31.440
and chat

22:31.440 --> 22:33.440
about their

22:33.440 --> 22:35.440
views.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.440
Thank you.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.440
Let me see if there are any questions.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.440
Let's finish

22:45.440 --> 22:47.440
our talk.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.440
We have a question

22:49.440 --> 22:51.440
for Yuxun.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.440
Let's hear from

22:53.440 --> 22:55.440
Mujie.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.440
Okay.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.440
I'm like Yuxun.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.440
When I was young,

23:01.440 --> 23:03.440
I wanted to

23:03.440 --> 23:05.440
become a scientist.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.440
I didn't know

23:07.440 --> 23:09.440
what I wanted to do.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
I decided to study chemistry

23:11.440 --> 23:13.440
when I was in high school.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.440
At that time,

23:15.440 --> 23:17.440
I found chemistry interesting.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.440
So I chose chemistry.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.440
I kept studying.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.440
I was different from

23:25.440 --> 23:27.440
most people.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.440
I decided to study

23:29.440 --> 23:31.440
in the Netherlands.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.440
Most people

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
went to the U.S. or the U.K.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.440
Before I went abroad,

23:37.440 --> 23:39.440
I asked

23:39.440 --> 23:41.440
my teacher

23:41.440 --> 23:43.440
if I wanted to

23:43.440 --> 23:45.440
go back to Taiwan

23:45.440 --> 23:47.440
to be a professor.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.440
If I went to the Netherlands,

23:49.440 --> 23:51.440
would it affect me?

23:51.440 --> 23:53.440
If you google the name of the university,

23:53.440 --> 23:55.440
it's not

23:55.440 --> 23:57.440
the top university in the world.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.440
My boss told me

24:01.440 --> 24:03.440
that if you really

24:03.440 --> 24:05.440
want to get a job,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.440
your name is not that important.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.440
What's important is

24:09.440 --> 24:11.440
what you got

24:11.440 --> 24:13.440
in the course of studying.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.440
Did you prepare yourself well?

24:15.440 --> 24:17.440
It's like

24:17.440 --> 24:19.440
what you said earlier.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.440
You need to know

24:21.440 --> 24:23.440
where you want to go

24:23.440 --> 24:25.440
and

24:25.440 --> 24:27.440
prepare yourself well.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.440
So I went to the Netherlands

24:31.440 --> 24:33.440
to study.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.440
When I was in the Netherlands,

24:35.440 --> 24:37.440
it was interesting.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.440
You mentioned

24:39.440 --> 24:41.440
joining a lab.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.440
It was a new lab.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.440
I was the first

24:45.440 --> 24:47.440
PhD student

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
of my boss.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.440
I learned

24:53.440 --> 24:55.440
how to build up

24:55.440 --> 24:57.440
your lab

24:57.440 --> 24:59.440
from a young faculty.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.440
After I graduated

25:01.440 --> 25:03.440
from my PhD,

25:03.440 --> 25:05.440
I joined a new lab

25:05.440 --> 25:07.440
and was the first

25:07.440 --> 25:09.440
PhD student of my boss.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.440
I didn't choose

25:13.440 --> 25:15.440
these places on purpose.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.440
Of course,

25:17.440 --> 25:19.440
I had some considerations.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.440
I think you need to

25:21.440 --> 25:23.440
pay attention to your personality.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.440
You like to stay in the city

25:25.440 --> 25:27.440
or go to

25:27.440 --> 25:29.440
university-like places.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.440
I think this

25:31.440 --> 25:33.440
will affect

25:33.440 --> 25:35.440
your daily life.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.440
I like to go to

25:37.440 --> 25:39.440
less crowded places.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
So I chose these places.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.440
Although Chicago

25:43.440 --> 25:45.440
is a big city,

25:45.440 --> 25:47.440
it's a bit helpless

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
because as a

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
PhD student in Europe,

25:51.440 --> 25:53.440
it's relatively difficult

25:53.440 --> 25:55.440
to find a postdoc in the US.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.440
Your boss doesn't help you much

25:57.440 --> 25:59.440
because he only knows people in Europe.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.440
He rarely knows people in the US.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.440
At that time,

26:03.440 --> 26:05.440
I flew from

26:05.440 --> 26:07.440
Europe and the Netherlands

26:07.440 --> 26:09.440
to the US for conferences

26:09.440 --> 26:11.440
to meet some young

26:11.440 --> 26:13.440
PIs.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.440
I took a few interviews

26:15.440 --> 26:17.440
and went to

26:17.440 --> 26:19.440
those PIs.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
He mentioned that

26:21.440 --> 26:23.440
he had a position

26:23.440 --> 26:25.440
and I went to

26:25.440 --> 26:27.440
talk to him.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.440
Although I didn't

26:29.440 --> 26:31.440
talk to him,

26:31.440 --> 26:33.440
it's because of

26:33.440 --> 26:35.440
other financial reasons.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.440
I think

26:37.440 --> 26:39.440
sometimes

26:39.440 --> 26:41.440
you don't have

26:41.440 --> 26:43.440
many choices.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.440
So you have to

26:45.440 --> 26:47.440
be prepared.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.440
If it's not your first choice,

26:49.440 --> 26:51.440
what will be your second

26:51.440 --> 26:53.440
or third choice?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.440
This is

26:55.440 --> 26:57.440
my overall

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
opinion.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.440
Let's see if

27:01.440 --> 27:03.440
there's anything else you want to know.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.440
Thank you, Mu Jie.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.440
We actually have a lot of questions

27:09.440 --> 27:11.440
and the questions came out

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
faster than we can digest.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.440
Some of them

27:15.440 --> 27:17.440
are about

27:17.440 --> 27:19.440
things to discuss later.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.440
Let's ask a question first.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.440
Chen Yixuan

27:23.440 --> 27:25.440
wants to ask Yuxun.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.440
During your Ph.D.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.440
and looking for a job,

27:29.440 --> 27:31.440
did you ever want to give up or

27:31.440 --> 27:33.440
change your career?

27:33.440 --> 27:35.440
How did you

27:35.440 --> 27:37.440
change your mind?

27:39.440 --> 27:41.440
Of course.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.440
This can be divided into

27:43.440 --> 27:45.440
two parts.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.440
One is an internal question

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
and the other is an external question.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.440
The internal question is

27:51.440 --> 27:53.440
when I was in my

27:53.440 --> 27:55.440
fourth year of Ph.D.,

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
I had my own paper.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.440
Before that, I didn't even have

27:59.440 --> 28:01.440
a second author's paper.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
In the process,

28:03.440 --> 28:05.440
I thought

28:05.440 --> 28:07.440
if I was not

28:07.440 --> 28:09.440
suitable for

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
academia.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
In academia,

28:13.440 --> 28:15.440
you need to have enough research

28:15.440 --> 28:17.440
to be able to

28:17.440 --> 28:19.440
continue.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.440
This is the internal part.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.440
The external part is

28:23.440 --> 28:25.440
when I was in my

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
fourth year of Ph.D.,

28:27.440 --> 28:29.440
I went to work

28:29.440 --> 28:31.440
at a tai chi shop.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.440
Although I

28:33.440 --> 28:35.440
saw them complaining about

28:35.440 --> 28:37.440
their busy schedule,

28:37.440 --> 28:39.440
I saw them buy a car,

28:39.440 --> 28:41.440
buy a house, get married,

28:41.440 --> 28:43.440
and have kids.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.440
Even my high school

28:45.440 --> 28:47.440
graduates

28:47.440 --> 28:49.440
bought a car

28:49.440 --> 28:51.440
and bought a house

28:51.440 --> 28:53.440
and had kids.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.440
I wondered

28:55.440 --> 28:57.440
if I was mentally ill

28:57.440 --> 28:59.440
and wanted to take this path.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.440
Of course, there were times

29:01.440 --> 29:03.440
when I wanted to give up.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.440
Every time

29:05.440 --> 29:07.440
I wanted to give up,

29:07.440 --> 29:09.440
I wanted to try again.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.440
Your life is only once.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.440
If you don't try,

29:13.440 --> 29:15.440
if you don't push your limits,

29:15.440 --> 29:17.440
you will never know

29:17.440 --> 29:19.440
how far you can go.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.440
I was trying

29:21.440 --> 29:23.440
as much as I could.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.440
On the other hand,

29:25.440 --> 29:27.440
I am very grateful

29:27.440 --> 29:29.440
to my family and friends

29:29.440 --> 29:31.440
for their help.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.440
I don't have any financial

29:33.440 --> 29:35.440
difficulties.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.440
To be honest,

29:37.440 --> 29:39.440
I don't have any financial difficulties.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.440
Compared to other Ph.D. students

29:41.440 --> 29:43.440
I know,

29:43.440 --> 29:45.440
I am relatively lucky.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
I am lucky

29:47.440 --> 29:49.440
because

29:49.440 --> 29:51.440
I know some people

29:51.440 --> 29:53.440
who are not so lucky.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.440
They've made it

29:55.440 --> 29:57.440
and survived.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.440
It's a great motivation

29:59.440 --> 30:01.440
to me.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.440
They've made it

30:03.440 --> 30:05.440
and survived.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.440
It's a great motivation

30:07.440 --> 30:09.440
to me.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.440
It's a great motivation

30:11.440 --> 30:13.440
to me.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.440
So I will spend

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
my days

30:17.440 --> 30:19.440
thinking about

30:19.440 --> 30:21.440
these three things.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.440
I will hang out

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
with my friends

30:25.440 --> 30:27.440
and chat a lot,

30:27.440 --> 30:29.440
or take a walk

30:29.440 --> 30:31.440
and listen to

30:31.440 --> 30:33.440
other people's stories

30:33.440 --> 30:35.440
in lectures.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.440
I even go to

30:37.440 --> 30:39.440
bookstores

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
to see how

30:41.440 --> 30:43.440
some of the

30:43.440 --> 30:45.440
drugs are good

30:45.440 --> 30:47.440
depending on how you use them.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
Sometimes you need

30:49.440 --> 30:51.440
positive energy

30:51.440 --> 30:53.440
to support you.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.440
This is my answer to this question.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.440
Very positive.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.440
Thank you.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.440
Our next question

31:03.440 --> 31:05.440
is related to

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
some of the questions

31:07.440 --> 31:09.440
that have been raised.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.440
For example,

31:11.440 --> 31:13.440
if you want to go to the industry

31:13.440 --> 31:15.440
but have not done an internship,

31:15.440 --> 31:17.440
do you need to do postdocs

31:17.440 --> 31:19.440
before going to the industry?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.440
Another question is

31:21.440 --> 31:23.440
if you have studied for many years

31:23.440 --> 31:25.440
and want to transition to

31:25.440 --> 31:27.440
the industry,

31:27.440 --> 31:29.440
will there be a deduction?

31:29.440 --> 31:31.440
Our next question

31:31.440 --> 31:33.440
is to ask

31:33.440 --> 31:35.440
how the academic research

31:35.440 --> 31:37.440
can help you

31:37.440 --> 31:39.440
and the advantages and disadvantages.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.440
Can you give us a general analysis?

31:41.440 --> 31:43.440
Let's sum up these questions

31:43.440 --> 31:45.440
and let Haowei answer them.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.440
Okay, no problem.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.440
I think

31:49.440 --> 31:51.440
the first question

31:51.440 --> 31:53.440
is

31:53.440 --> 31:55.440
whether you need to

31:55.440 --> 31:57.440
do postdocs

31:57.440 --> 31:59.440
before going to work.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.440
Postdocs is a time for relaxation.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.440
If you want to go to the industry,

32:03.440 --> 32:05.440
you can find a new city

32:05.440 --> 32:07.440
or an interesting topic.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.440
That topic is very needed

32:09.440 --> 32:11.440
in the industry now.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.440
It is a good opportunity

32:13.440 --> 32:15.440
to be a jump board.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.440
If not, it's okay.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.440
If you have not done postdocs,

32:19.440 --> 32:21.440
if you can find

32:21.440 --> 32:23.440
a similar job,

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440
it's good.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.440
But in fact,

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
if you want to apply

32:29.440 --> 32:31.440
what you learned in PhD

32:31.440 --> 32:33.440
to the industry,

32:33.440 --> 32:35.440
for me,

32:35.440 --> 32:37.440
what I learned

32:37.440 --> 32:39.440
in PhD is

32:39.440 --> 32:41.440
soft skills.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.440
How to make a presentation,

32:43.440 --> 32:45.440
how to

32:45.440 --> 32:47.440
do a literature search,

32:47.440 --> 32:49.440
how to

32:49.440 --> 32:51.440
present your idea to others.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
I think these soft skills

32:53.440 --> 32:55.440
are more important.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
As for

32:57.440 --> 32:59.440
hard skills,

32:59.440 --> 33:01.440
it depends on

33:01.440 --> 33:03.440
whether there are elements

33:03.440 --> 33:05.440
in the topic of PhD.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.440
For example,

33:07.440 --> 33:09.440
you can talk to your friends

33:09.440 --> 33:11.440
in the industry

33:11.440 --> 33:13.440
about which skills

33:13.440 --> 33:15.440
the industry needs.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.440
When the industry is looking for talents,

33:17.440 --> 33:19.440
it depends on your experience

33:19.440 --> 33:21.440
and your skill set.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.440
There are two ways

33:23.440 --> 33:25.440
when the industry is looking for talents.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.440
One is fresh grad.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.440
I take you in and train you again.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.440
It depends on

33:31.440 --> 33:33.440
your experience.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.440
It depends on your luck.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.440
Any other questions?

33:43.440 --> 33:45.440
I'm curious about

33:45.440 --> 33:47.440
a similar question.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
When did you

33:49.440 --> 33:51.440
start to want to work in the industry?

33:51.440 --> 33:53.440
Did you do the internship

33:53.440 --> 33:55.440
because you wanted to work in the industry?

33:55.440 --> 33:57.440
Did you decide

33:57.440 --> 33:59.440
to go this way

33:59.440 --> 34:01.440
after the internship?

34:01.440 --> 34:03.440
Or did you decide

34:03.440 --> 34:05.440
to go this way

34:05.440 --> 34:07.440
after the internship?

34:13.440 --> 34:15.440
I'm more interested

34:15.440 --> 34:17.440
in the industry.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.440
First,

34:23.440 --> 34:25.440
I don't like to write papers.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.440
I think

34:27.440 --> 34:29.440
it's a waste of time

34:29.440 --> 34:31.440
to write papers.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.440
I want to do something

34:33.440 --> 34:35.440
that makes me feel

34:35.440 --> 34:37.440
accomplished.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.440
I started to work in the industry

34:39.440 --> 34:41.440
in my third or fourth year.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.440
After I saw

34:43.440 --> 34:45.440
the algorithm,

34:45.440 --> 34:47.440
millions of people

34:47.440 --> 34:49.440
were using it.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.440
I felt accomplished.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.440
Any other questions?

34:57.440 --> 34:59.440
Besides

34:59.440 --> 35:01.440
hiring people in the industry,

35:01.440 --> 35:03.440
are you interested in

35:03.440 --> 35:05.440
starting your own business

35:05.440 --> 35:07.440
or starting a new company?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.440
In Boston,

35:11.440 --> 35:13.440
the start-up culture

35:13.440 --> 35:15.440
is very strong.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.440
I'm a member

35:17.440 --> 35:19.440
of the Yushan Technology Association.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.440
We advocate

35:21.440 --> 35:23.440
start-ups

35:23.440 --> 35:25.440
and resources

35:25.440 --> 35:27.440
to hold events

35:27.440 --> 35:29.440
to add these things.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.440
We have investors

35:31.440 --> 35:33.440
who fund us.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.440
We have entrepreneurs

35:35.440 --> 35:37.440
who have started a business.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.440
We have local

35:39.440 --> 35:41.440
technology scientists.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
We have these resources.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.440
We hold events every year

35:45.440 --> 35:47.440
to see if we can create something new.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.440
I have a friend

35:49.440 --> 35:51.440
who is a doctor.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.440
He also started a company

35:53.440 --> 35:55.440
in Taiwan.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.440
He does AI and healthcare.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.440
I might

35:59.440 --> 36:01.440
be interested in

36:01.440 --> 36:03.440
starting a start-up company

36:03.440 --> 36:05.440
after a while.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.440
I might give it a try.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.440
You may not know.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.440
I just asked this question.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.440
Hao Wei

36:15.440 --> 36:17.440
is very active

36:17.440 --> 36:19.440
in Taiwan's industry

36:19.440 --> 36:21.440
and start-up organizations

36:21.440 --> 36:23.440
and clubs.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.440
If you have any questions,

36:25.440 --> 36:27.440
you can contact him

36:27.440 --> 36:29.440
to discuss or collaborate.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.440
Can you hear me?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.440
Yes.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.440
I'm Yiting.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.440
Yanyong asked a lot of questions.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.440
Can I go back

36:41.440 --> 36:43.440
and ask more?

36:43.440 --> 36:45.440
Sure.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.440
He asked

36:47.440 --> 36:49.440
if you need to

36:49.440 --> 36:51.440
be a postdoc.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.440
He also asked

36:53.440 --> 36:55.440
if you want to

36:55.440 --> 36:57.440
become an intern

36:57.440 --> 36:59.440
after completing

36:59.440 --> 37:01.440
a PhD.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.440
He also asked

37:03.440 --> 37:05.440
if you want to

37:05.440 --> 37:07.440
become a postdoc

37:07.440 --> 37:09.440
after completing

37:09.440 --> 37:11.440
a PhD.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.440
I'm curious.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.440
Can you share

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
your thoughts?

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
Hi.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.440
This question

37:23.440 --> 37:25.440
is very specific.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.440
It's easy to find a job

37:27.440 --> 37:29.440
in electronics.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
But it's not easy

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
to find a job

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
in bio.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.440
Most people

37:37.440 --> 37:39.440
can't find a job

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
after completing

37:41.440 --> 37:43.440
a postdoc.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.440
I think

37:45.440 --> 37:47.440
it's important

37:47.440 --> 37:49.440
to ask people

37:49.440 --> 37:51.440
in the same field

37:51.440 --> 37:53.440
how to use

37:53.440 --> 37:55.440
their skills

37:55.440 --> 37:57.440
in the industry.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.440
Thank you.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.440
Yiting is in Europe, right?

38:03.440 --> 38:05.440
Yes.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.440
I'm in Switzerland.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.440
You're a world-famous person.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.440
Yes.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
Today is a special day.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
It's not a regular day.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.440
I can participate.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.440
We're usually

38:19.440 --> 38:21.440
in North America.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.440
It's a suitable day for us.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.440
But it's a world-famous day.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.440
Okay.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.440
Mu Jie

38:29.440 --> 38:31.440
said something

38:31.440 --> 38:33.440
interesting.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.440
Let me ask you.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.440
I think Mu Jie

38:37.440 --> 38:39.440
is an expert

38:39.440 --> 38:41.440
who works with young professors.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.440
He works with young professors

38:43.440 --> 38:45.440
at every stage.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.440
He's a young boss now.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
Can you share

38:49.440 --> 38:51.440
with us

38:51.440 --> 38:53.440
if you're worried

38:53.440 --> 38:55.440
that it's hard

38:55.440 --> 38:57.440
to find a job

38:57.440 --> 38:59.440
with a young boss

38:59.440 --> 39:01.440
or a boss

39:01.440 --> 39:03.440
who's not

39:03.440 --> 39:05.440
as good as Mu Jie?

39:05.440 --> 39:07.440
Do you have any

39:07.440 --> 39:09.440
suggestions

39:09.440 --> 39:11.440
for young people

39:11.440 --> 39:13.440
who want to work with young bosses?

39:13.440 --> 39:15.440
I think

39:15.440 --> 39:17.440
it's very risky

39:17.440 --> 39:19.440
to work with young bosses.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.440
You don't know

39:21.440 --> 39:23.440
their past records.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.440
You can only check

39:25.440 --> 39:27.440
their past publications.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.440
It's risky.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.440
But

39:31.440 --> 39:33.440
another advantage of young professors

39:33.440 --> 39:35.440
is that

39:35.440 --> 39:37.440
you can be sure

39:37.440 --> 39:39.440
they won't fail.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.440
After all,

39:41.440 --> 39:43.440
they're under pressure.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.440
So you can be sure

39:45.440 --> 39:47.440
they won't fail.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.440
If you meet a young boss

39:49.440 --> 39:51.440
who's not as good as you,

39:51.440 --> 39:53.440
you can

39:53.440 --> 39:55.440
leave

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
after a few years.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.440
Because

39:59.440 --> 40:01.440
even if

40:01.440 --> 40:03.440
your boss is very influential,

40:03.440 --> 40:05.440
to a certain extent,

40:05.440 --> 40:07.440
if he's

40:07.440 --> 40:09.440
very influential

40:09.440 --> 40:11.440
and helps you

40:11.440 --> 40:13.440
make progress,

40:13.440 --> 40:15.440
to a certain extent,

40:15.440 --> 40:17.440
you'll be influenced by him.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.440
If he's a good boss,

40:19.440 --> 40:21.440
I don't think it's a problem.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.440
If he's not a good boss,

40:23.440 --> 40:25.440
he might help you

40:25.440 --> 40:27.440
find a job.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.440
He might start to tell you

40:29.440 --> 40:31.440
or suggest you

40:31.440 --> 40:33.440
that he helped you

40:33.440 --> 40:35.440
and you should help him.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
It's hard to say no.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.440
Another idea

40:39.440 --> 40:41.440
is to

40:41.440 --> 40:43.440
take a risk with them.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.440
It's a high-risk, high-reward.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.440
I had this idea

40:47.440 --> 40:49.440
when I was young.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.440
You work with young professors.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.440
When they become famous,

40:53.440 --> 40:55.440
you're still a student.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.440
When they become influential,

40:57.440 --> 40:59.440
you're still a student.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.440
But if you work with an old professor,

41:01.440 --> 41:03.440
who will help you after he's gone?

41:03.440 --> 41:05.440
It's a similar idea.

41:05.440 --> 41:07.440
So I think

41:07.440 --> 41:09.440
young professors

41:09.440 --> 41:11.440
are at risk.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.440
When I was making these choices,

41:15.440 --> 41:17.440
I interviewed

41:17.440 --> 41:19.440
those bosses.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.440
You have to talk to them.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.440
You have to know

41:23.440 --> 41:25.440
what they expect you to do.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.440
I think

41:27.440 --> 41:29.440
it was special at the beginning.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.440
In the Netherlands,

41:31.440 --> 41:33.440
you interview

41:33.440 --> 41:35.440
the boss.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.440
He'll give you

41:37.440 --> 41:39.440
a clear question

41:39.440 --> 41:41.440
about what you should do.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.440
Before I left,

41:43.440 --> 41:45.440
I knew

41:45.440 --> 41:47.440
what kind of personality

41:47.440 --> 41:49.440
my future boss would have

41:49.440 --> 41:51.440
and what kind of question

41:51.440 --> 41:53.440
I should ask.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.440
So I knew

41:55.440 --> 41:57.440
I could start working

41:57.440 --> 41:59.440
right away.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.440
As for POSA,

42:01.440 --> 42:03.440
I thought

42:03.440 --> 42:05.440
I could get along

42:05.440 --> 42:07.440
with them.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.440
So

42:09.440 --> 42:11.440
I decided

42:11.440 --> 42:13.440
to go to POSA.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.440
Another reason

42:15.440 --> 42:17.440
I went to POSA

42:17.440 --> 42:19.440
is that

42:19.440 --> 42:21.440
I didn't want to

42:21.440 --> 42:23.440
wait too long

42:23.440 --> 42:25.440
to get a job there.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.440
So that was

42:27.440 --> 42:29.440
the only offer I had.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.440
I asked

42:31.440 --> 42:33.440
my college classmate

42:33.440 --> 42:35.440
in the US.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.440
I asked him

42:37.440 --> 42:39.440
how to get a job at POSA.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.440
He said young professors

42:41.440 --> 42:43.440
usually have those positions.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.440
Young professors

42:45.440 --> 42:47.440
just got here,

42:47.440 --> 42:49.440
so they must have

42:49.440 --> 42:51.440
a few POSA positions.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.440
So they must have them.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.440
If you go to

42:55.440 --> 42:57.440
well-known labs,

42:57.440 --> 42:59.440
they can't help you.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.440
They might have a POSA position,

43:01.440 --> 43:03.440
but half a year ago,

43:03.440 --> 43:05.440
it was booked.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.440
So you can't find it.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.440
So you have to

43:09.440 --> 43:11.440
beg for a POSA.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.440
So I think

43:13.440 --> 43:15.440
it's not the same.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.440
The most important thing is

43:17.440 --> 43:19.440
to select your boss.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.440
At least talk to him.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.440
Don't just follow him.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.440
Then decide

43:25.440 --> 43:27.440
the next few days.

43:27.440 --> 43:29.440
Another important thing

43:29.440 --> 43:31.440
is if you don't think

43:31.440 --> 43:33.440
it's suitable,

43:33.440 --> 43:35.440
leave early.

43:35.440 --> 43:37.440
Be brave and say no.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.440
Give up earlier

43:39.440 --> 43:41.440
is better than

43:41.440 --> 43:43.440
giving up later.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.440
Because

43:45.440 --> 43:47.440
when you get to

43:47.440 --> 43:49.440
the level of POSA,

43:49.440 --> 43:51.440
at least some people

43:51.440 --> 43:53.440
have families

43:53.440 --> 43:55.440
or a stable partner.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.440
If you're not

43:57.440 --> 43:59.440
in a good mood,

43:59.440 --> 44:01.440
it will affect more people,

44:01.440 --> 44:03.440
not just you.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.440
So that's about it.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
Okay.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.440
Did anyone

44:09.440 --> 44:11.440
want to ask a question?

44:11.440 --> 44:13.440
Do you want to apply for a doctorate in the Netherlands?

44:13.440 --> 44:15.440
Yes. Let's expand

44:15.440 --> 44:17.440
this question.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.440
Why did you want to apply?

44:19.440 --> 44:21.440
For example, the Netherlands.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.440
Did you only apply for the Netherlands?

44:23.440 --> 44:25.440
Or did you apply to other European countries?

44:25.440 --> 44:27.440
At that time,

44:27.440 --> 44:29.440
the situation was like this.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.440
The application in the Netherlands was different.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.440
It's not like the United States or Taiwan.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.440
You have to apply at a fixed time every year.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.440
Because every year,

44:37.440 --> 44:39.440
you have to submit something

44:39.440 --> 44:41.440
The doctor in the Netherlands

44:41.440 --> 44:43.440
is very similar to what I just said.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.440
Because it's a very specific topic.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.440
So it's actually the boss's

44:47.440 --> 44:49.440
application plan.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.440
Then he will get a doctorate position.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.440
When he gets this doctorate position,

44:53.440 --> 44:55.440
he will advertise it.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.440
So basically, you can apply all year round.

44:57.440 --> 44:59.440
The point is whether the boss has received the money or not.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.440
So he can apply all year round.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.440
So he has

45:03.440 --> 45:05.440
a lot of free time.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.440
At that time,

45:07.440 --> 45:09.440
I was preparing for the application in the United States.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.440
But it just so happens that

45:11.440 --> 45:13.440
there was a student in our department

45:13.440 --> 45:15.440
who was studying for a doctorate in the Netherlands.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.440
He said that there was a new teacher

45:17.440 --> 45:19.440
in their school and there were several positions.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.440
Then I saw the topic and thought it was quite interesting.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.440
So I made an appointment with the teacher.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.440
This interview was actually before

45:25.440 --> 45:27.440
I sent out the application in the United States.

45:27.440 --> 45:29.440
After the interview,

45:29.440 --> 45:31.440
the boss

45:31.440 --> 45:33.440
was willing to give me a position.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.440
So I didn't apply to the United States at the end.

45:35.440 --> 45:37.440
Oh, you didn't apply at all?

45:37.440 --> 45:39.440
I had everything ready.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.440
I was actually going to send it out.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.440
Because I told him that

45:43.440 --> 45:45.440
I asked him when he would give me a reply.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.440
Then he gave me a time.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.440
Because I told him that if he gave me a reply,

45:49.440 --> 45:51.440
I would go if he was willing to.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.440
Then I would stop all the applications in the United States.

45:53.440 --> 45:55.440
So I was willing to do this at that time.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.440
Just go.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.440
So if you want to apply for a doctorate in Europe,

45:59.440 --> 46:01.440
most of the time

46:01.440 --> 46:03.440
you have to take the initiative to look at

46:03.440 --> 46:05.440
all the teachers' websites

46:05.440 --> 46:07.440
or all the schools'

46:07.440 --> 46:09.440
HR websites.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.440
Then there will be some positions on it.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.440
Yes.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.440
So like this,

46:15.440 --> 46:17.440
because you have a classmate

46:17.440 --> 46:19.440
or a junior who knows this information,

46:19.440 --> 46:21.440
but you just said

46:21.440 --> 46:23.440
most of them will directly post

46:23.440 --> 46:25.440
information like this

46:25.440 --> 46:27.440
talent or real person.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.440
Is it the same as

46:29.440 --> 46:31.440
applying for a doctorate

46:31.440 --> 46:33.440
in the Netherlands?

46:33.440 --> 46:35.440
Or where can you find this information?

46:35.440 --> 46:37.440
At least I'm sure it's on the same platform

46:37.440 --> 46:39.440
in the Netherlands.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.440
Because it's really

46:41.440 --> 46:43.440
like going to a company to find a job.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.440
It's a bit like

46:45.440 --> 46:47.440
going to a company's

46:47.440 --> 46:49.440
website's HR section.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.440
Then it will list all the positions.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.440
So it will list

46:53.440 --> 46:55.440
that it may have a faculty position

46:55.440 --> 46:57.440
or a Ph.D. position.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.440
So it's actually found here.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.440
I forgot to mention that

47:01.440 --> 47:03.440
the reason why I chose the Netherlands

47:03.440 --> 47:05.440
is because when I was in the university,

47:05.440 --> 47:07.440
my teacher

47:07.440 --> 47:09.440
asked me to go to the Netherlands

47:09.440 --> 47:11.440
for a meeting.

47:11.440 --> 47:13.440
So I went there for some exchange activities.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.440
I had a good impression of the Netherlands.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.440
So I decided to go to the Netherlands.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.440
Someone asked

47:19.440 --> 47:21.440
how competitive it was.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.440
Actually, it was very competitive.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.440
Yes, it was really competitive.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.440
Yes, but I think

47:29.440 --> 47:31.440
actually...

47:31.440 --> 47:33.440
I'm sorry.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.440
Actually, finding a faculty position

47:35.440 --> 47:37.440
is...

47:37.440 --> 47:39.440
I think people often have a misunderstanding.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.440
It's like someone is very good

47:41.440 --> 47:43.440
but he didn't get a faculty position.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.440
I think this is very strange.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.440
But actually it's not like that.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.440
The reason is

47:49.440 --> 47:51.440
you have to look at

47:51.440 --> 47:53.440
what kind of person

47:53.440 --> 47:55.440
your target department

47:55.440 --> 47:57.440
is.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.440
For example, in the field of chemistry,

47:59.440 --> 48:01.440
I'm just saying.

48:01.440 --> 48:03.440
It's not that our department is looking for it now.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.440
Let's say our department wants to find

48:05.440 --> 48:07.440
an organic chemistry person.

48:07.440 --> 48:09.440
You apply for a person

48:09.440 --> 48:11.440
who is super good at physics and chemistry.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.440
Basically, his chances are very small.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.440
Yes, the reason is

48:15.440 --> 48:17.440
that we don't have that shortage

48:17.440 --> 48:19.440
in physics and chemistry now.

48:19.440 --> 48:21.440
Because I often find faculty

48:21.440 --> 48:23.440
to satisfy

48:23.440 --> 48:25.440
their expectations

48:25.440 --> 48:27.440
for teaching in the future.

48:27.440 --> 48:29.440
Yes, so I think

48:29.440 --> 48:31.440
don't be too self-absorbed.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.440
Why do you think the person

48:33.440 --> 48:35.440
who applied is worse than me?

48:35.440 --> 48:37.440
Why can he still go?

48:37.440 --> 48:39.440
But it's mainly

48:39.440 --> 48:41.440
because of this reason.

48:41.440 --> 48:43.440
Especially if you are

48:43.440 --> 48:45.440
going to a more advanced school.

48:45.440 --> 48:47.440
Yes, and sometimes

48:47.440 --> 48:49.440
because

48:49.440 --> 48:51.440
the direction you are going

48:51.440 --> 48:53.440
is that there is a young teacher

48:53.440 --> 48:55.440
or there are already a lot of people

48:55.440 --> 48:57.440
doing this direction,

48:57.440 --> 48:59.440
so you can't get into that department.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.440
Yes, so it's often...

49:01.440 --> 49:03.440
So part of the competition

49:03.440 --> 49:05.440
is actually here.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.440
And this is actually

49:07.440 --> 49:09.440
a place you can't control yourself.

49:09.440 --> 49:11.440
So I often say that

49:11.440 --> 49:13.440
sometimes when you are looking for a teacher,

49:13.440 --> 49:15.440
you actually need to ask

49:15.440 --> 49:17.440
your former teacher

49:17.440 --> 49:19.440
about it,

49:19.440 --> 49:21.440
which direction this time

49:21.440 --> 49:23.440
he wants to go.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.440
Yes, so that's probably it.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.440
In fact,

49:27.440 --> 49:29.440
if you want to lose postdoc,

49:29.440 --> 49:31.440
no, sorry, you want to lose the faculty position,

49:31.440 --> 49:33.440
this department

49:33.440 --> 49:35.440
has a very important

49:35.440 --> 49:37.440
future plan for its own research.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.440
But how high do you think the opportunity is

49:39.440 --> 49:41.440
that you can use

49:41.440 --> 49:43.440
what you are good at to break it?

49:43.440 --> 49:45.440
For example, they wanted to find a light school,

49:45.440 --> 49:47.440
but you are, for example,

49:47.440 --> 49:49.440
super strong, so strong that you can

49:49.440 --> 49:51.440
make them rather give up or

49:51.440 --> 49:53.440
re-adjust their future plan.

49:53.440 --> 49:55.440
Or is this basically impossible to happen?

49:55.440 --> 49:57.440
This is definitely possible to happen.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.440
This is definitely possible to happen.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.440
Because if you go to a

50:01.440 --> 50:03.440
research-focused school,

50:03.440 --> 50:05.440
the chance of this happening will be higher.

50:05.440 --> 50:07.440
Yes, but it will become

50:07.440 --> 50:09.440
an extra person

50:09.440 --> 50:11.440
to help you.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.440
Yes, but

50:13.440 --> 50:15.440
another problem is that

50:15.440 --> 50:17.440
in Taiwan, faculty positions

50:17.440 --> 50:19.440
are actually limited.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.440
So if you happen to

50:21.440 --> 50:23.440
meet a faculty today,

50:23.440 --> 50:25.440
there is only one person left.

50:25.440 --> 50:27.440
Then the difficulty will increase a lot.

50:27.440 --> 50:29.440
Because after he hired you,

50:29.440 --> 50:31.440
even if you are very good,

50:31.440 --> 50:33.440
what about the gap in teaching

50:33.440 --> 50:35.440
in the next two years?

50:35.440 --> 50:37.440
So there will be this.

50:37.440 --> 50:39.440
There may also be such a situation.

50:39.440 --> 50:41.440
So like I said,

50:41.440 --> 50:43.440
it's actually very important to find

50:43.440 --> 50:45.440
someone who can help you.

50:45.440 --> 50:47.440
Because they will also know

50:47.440 --> 50:49.440
if there is a way to

50:49.440 --> 50:51.440
argue with the school for some positions.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.440
Because in fact, these can all be discussed.

50:53.440 --> 50:55.440
How good you are actually depends on

50:55.440 --> 50:57.440
how much the department is willing to help you.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.440
Yes, if you are really super strong.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.440
Suppose you are

51:01.440 --> 51:03.440
in Caltech today and

51:03.440 --> 51:05.440
you are an assistant professor

51:05.440 --> 51:07.440
and you are willing to come back to Taiwan.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.440
Then I think the space that will be willing to help you

51:09.440 --> 51:11.440
is already much bigger.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.440
This will definitely be a big news.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.440
But this is just an exaggerated example.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
But what I mean is that

51:17.440 --> 51:19.440
the more powerful you are,

51:19.440 --> 51:21.440
the more willing to help you.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.440
So even if you find out

51:23.440 --> 51:25.440
that it is not your own field,

51:25.440 --> 51:27.440
but you will still encourage you to apply.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.440
You just don't have to

51:29.440 --> 51:31.440
do it because you have it or not.

51:31.440 --> 51:33.440
Yes, yes, yes.

51:33.440 --> 51:35.440
OK, now that we have talked about

51:35.440 --> 51:37.440
looking for this job,

51:37.440 --> 51:39.440
this academia job.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.440
In fact, we have arranged

51:41.440 --> 51:43.440
a very good video

51:43.440 --> 51:45.440
prepared by Yuxun.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.440
You can tell us about

51:47.440 --> 51:49.440
his application,

51:49.440 --> 51:51.440
such as Price Postdoc Fellowship

51:51.440 --> 51:53.440
and independent research funding.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.440
They all applied for this

51:55.440 --> 51:57.440
Einstein project.

51:57.440 --> 51:59.440
Otherwise, let's invite Yuxun

51:59.440 --> 52:01.440
to share his video now.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.440
OK, no problem.

52:03.440 --> 52:05.440
Can you see it now?

52:05.440 --> 52:07.440
I just saw it,

52:07.440 --> 52:09.440
but I can't see it now.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.440
Can you see it now?

52:11.440 --> 52:13.440
Yes, yes.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.440
OK,

52:15.440 --> 52:17.440
because of the limited time,

52:17.440 --> 52:19.440
I will directly cut to the point.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.440
OK, so here you can see

52:21.440 --> 52:23.440
the review key points

52:23.440 --> 52:25.440
of the Einstein project.

52:25.440 --> 52:27.440
It includes the applicant's

52:27.440 --> 52:29.440
ambition,

52:29.440 --> 52:31.440
and then your research

52:31.440 --> 52:33.440
topic,

52:33.440 --> 52:35.440
how important it is to society,

52:35.440 --> 52:37.440
what kind of contribution it makes to society,

52:37.440 --> 52:39.440
and how to train the research team.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.440
The Columbus project is basically

52:41.440 --> 52:43.440
the same as the Einstein project.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.440
It just has one more

52:45.440 --> 52:47.440
international cooperation experience

52:47.440 --> 52:49.440
and an important plan

52:49.440 --> 52:51.440
to serve the International Academy of Sciences.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.440
So let's talk about

52:53.440 --> 52:55.440
it one by one.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.440
When you apply for this project,

52:57.440 --> 52:59.440
what kind of preparation

52:59.440 --> 53:01.440
do you need to do?

53:09.440 --> 53:11.440
Hello.

53:11.440 --> 53:13.440
OK, so basically

53:13.440 --> 53:15.440
the above review key points

53:15.440 --> 53:17.440
are a bit confusing, right?

53:17.440 --> 53:19.440
First of all,

53:19.440 --> 53:21.440
the most important thing

53:21.440 --> 53:23.440
is your

53:23.440 --> 53:25.440
first item.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.440
The first item is to ask

53:27.440 --> 53:29.440
the applicant

53:29.440 --> 53:31.440
how important

53:31.440 --> 53:33.440
the project is

53:33.440 --> 53:35.440
and how long

53:35.440 --> 53:37.440
it will last.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.440
So you have to

53:39.440 --> 53:41.440
try to describe

53:41.440 --> 53:43.440
how important

53:43.440 --> 53:45.440
and how long

53:45.440 --> 53:47.440
your project is

53:47.440 --> 53:49.440
in your plan.

53:49.440 --> 53:51.440
Because the plan review

53:51.440 --> 53:53.440
is one of the review opinions

53:53.440 --> 53:55.440
that applicants often encounter.

53:55.440 --> 53:57.440
But the applicant is not an expert

53:57.440 --> 53:59.440
in this area.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.440
So when you write

54:01.440 --> 54:03.440
the background of the study,

54:03.440 --> 54:05.440
you have to focus on

54:05.440 --> 54:07.440
some key points.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.440
For example,

54:09.440 --> 54:11.440
how to get the reviewer

54:11.440 --> 54:13.440
to catch

54:13.440 --> 54:15.440
your point

54:15.440 --> 54:17.440
quickly.

54:17.440 --> 54:19.440
So

54:19.440 --> 54:21.440
I think

54:21.440 --> 54:23.440
there is a very good

54:23.440 --> 54:25.440
way to get

54:25.440 --> 54:27.440
the reviewer to catch

54:27.440 --> 54:29.440
your point

54:29.440 --> 54:31.440
quickly.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.440
You can ask

54:33.440 --> 54:35.440
some friends

54:35.440 --> 54:37.440
who are not in the field

54:37.440 --> 54:39.440
to introduce

54:39.440 --> 54:41.440
the background of

54:41.440 --> 54:43.440
your study.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.440
Because they are not in the field,

54:45.440 --> 54:47.440
they will know

54:47.440 --> 54:49.440
where the blind spot is.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.440
They will tell you

54:51.440 --> 54:53.440
when you apply,

54:53.440 --> 54:55.440
they will tell you

54:55.440 --> 54:57.440
your study is

54:57.440 --> 54:59.440
application type,

54:59.440 --> 55:01.440
orientation type,

55:01.440 --> 55:03.440
or basic research type.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.440
These are the three types.

55:05.440 --> 55:07.440
So when you apply,

55:07.440 --> 55:09.440
if you are

55:09.440 --> 55:11.440
basic research type,

55:11.440 --> 55:13.440
it's basically like this picture.

55:13.440 --> 55:15.440
The person on your right

55:15.440 --> 55:17.440
wants to cross the river to the other side.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.440
For a mathematician,

55:19.440 --> 55:21.440
if you are a smart mathematician,

55:21.440 --> 55:23.440
you basically

55:23.440 --> 55:25.440
shrink the whole two-dimensional plane

55:25.440 --> 55:27.440
into a point.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.440
You fold it over,

55:29.440 --> 55:31.440
and the person can jump over the river.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
So this is called theoretical research.

55:33.440 --> 55:35.440
In other words,

55:35.440 --> 55:37.440
it has nothing to do with application.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.440
It is a more basic research.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.440
For example,

55:41.440 --> 55:43.440
if you want to study

55:43.440 --> 55:45.440
in another field,

55:45.440 --> 55:47.440
if you want to study

55:47.440 --> 55:49.440
where the gap is between

55:49.440 --> 55:51.440
basic research and

55:51.440 --> 55:53.440
basic research,

55:53.440 --> 55:55.440
it may not be able to

55:55.440 --> 55:57.440
apply immediately.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.440
What is application type research?

55:59.440 --> 56:01.440
Basically,

56:01.440 --> 56:03.440
what kind of problem do you want to overcome

56:03.440 --> 56:05.440
if you want to cross the river?

56:05.440 --> 56:07.440
How do you build a bridge?

56:07.440 --> 56:09.440
If you build a bridge,

56:09.440 --> 56:11.440
what kind of earthquake

56:11.440 --> 56:13.440
can it withstand?

56:13.440 --> 56:15.440
This is called application type research.

56:15.440 --> 56:17.440
Based on application type

56:17.440 --> 56:19.440
and basic research,

56:19.440 --> 56:21.440
it is basically like this picture.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.440
You feel like there is something

56:23.440 --> 56:25.440
that can be done,

56:25.440 --> 56:27.440
but it is not so practical.

56:27.440 --> 56:29.440
You are not sure

56:29.440 --> 56:31.440
if it is really possible in the future.

56:31.440 --> 56:33.440
But it seems to be able to do it

56:33.440 --> 56:35.440
and seems to be applicable.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.440
This thing is called

56:37.440 --> 56:39.440
orientation type research.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.440
So whether it is orientation type research,

56:41.440 --> 56:43.440
basic research,

56:43.440 --> 56:45.440
or application type research,

56:45.440 --> 56:47.440
you can first explain

56:47.440 --> 56:49.440
the importance of your problem.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.440
For example,

56:51.440 --> 56:53.440
why do people cross the river?

56:53.440 --> 56:55.440
How difficult is it to cross the river?

56:55.440 --> 56:57.440
After crossing the river,

56:57.440 --> 56:59.440
what can you do to help

56:59.440 --> 57:01.440
these people?

57:01.440 --> 57:03.440
If you change to

57:03.440 --> 57:05.440
a practical case,

57:09.440 --> 57:11.440
you have to explain

57:11.440 --> 57:13.440
the relevance of your research

57:13.440 --> 57:15.440
to Taiwan.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.440
What can you do to help Taiwan?

57:17.440 --> 57:19.440
For example,

57:19.440 --> 57:21.440
after solving this problem,

57:21.440 --> 57:23.440
how much can you improve

57:23.440 --> 57:25.440
Taiwan's academic status?

57:25.440 --> 57:27.440
You can write a KPI.

57:27.440 --> 57:29.440
You can find a way

57:29.440 --> 57:31.440
to give a qualitative

57:31.440 --> 57:33.440
or quantitative value

57:33.440 --> 57:35.440
to let the reviewer know

57:35.440 --> 57:37.440
how much help

57:37.440 --> 57:39.440
your research will have

57:39.440 --> 57:41.440
in the future.

57:41.440 --> 57:43.440
In other words,

57:43.440 --> 57:45.440
where is your contribution?

57:45.440 --> 57:47.440
If you are applying type research,

57:47.440 --> 57:49.440
you have to find a way

57:49.440 --> 57:51.440
to write how much value

57:51.440 --> 57:53.440
you can contribute.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.440
What kind of talents

57:55.440 --> 57:57.440
can you cultivate in your plan?

57:57.440 --> 57:59.440
What kind of help

57:59.440 --> 58:01.440
can these talents

58:01.440 --> 58:03.440
bring to Taiwan's industry

58:03.440 --> 58:05.440
or Taiwan's academics?

58:05.440 --> 58:07.440
So try to use

58:07.440 --> 58:09.440
some slogans

58:09.440 --> 58:11.440
in your plan.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.440
Don't write too much.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.440
You have to be specific

58:15.440 --> 58:17.440
about what you want to do.

58:17.440 --> 58:19.440
You have to be specific

58:19.440 --> 58:21.440
about what you want to do.

58:21.440 --> 58:23.440
This is more acceptable

58:23.440 --> 58:25.440
to the reviewer.

58:25.440 --> 58:27.440
This is more acceptable

58:27.440 --> 58:29.440
to the reviewer.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.440
I applied for the Einstein Project

58:31.440 --> 58:33.440
twice.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.440
The first time,

58:35.440 --> 58:37.440
I didn't write too much.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.440
The second time,

58:39.440 --> 58:41.440
I didn't write too much.

58:41.440 --> 58:43.440
The third time,

58:43.440 --> 58:45.440
I didn't write too much.

58:45.440 --> 58:47.440
The fourth time,

58:47.440 --> 58:49.440
I didn't write too much.

58:49.440 --> 58:51.440
I just wrote down

58:51.440 --> 58:53.440
what kind of talent

58:53.440 --> 58:55.440
I want to cultivate

58:55.440 --> 58:57.440
and what kind of value

58:57.440 --> 58:59.440
I can contribute.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.440
I just wrote down

59:01.440 --> 59:03.440
what kind of talent

59:03.440 --> 59:05.440
I want to cultivate

59:05.440 --> 59:07.440
and what kind of value

59:07.440 --> 59:09.440
I can contribute.

59:09.440 --> 59:11.440
I just wrote down

59:11.440 --> 59:13.440
what kind of talent

59:13.440 --> 59:15.440
I want to cultivate

59:15.440 --> 59:17.440
and what kind of value

59:17.440 --> 59:19.440
I can contribute.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.440
So tell me

59:27.440 --> 59:29.440
what kind of talent

59:29.440 --> 59:31.440
you want to cultivate

59:31.440 --> 59:33.440
and what kind of value

59:33.440 --> 59:35.440
I can contribute.

59:35.440 --> 59:37.440
So tell me

59:37.440 --> 59:39.440
what kind of talent

59:39.440 --> 59:41.440
you want to cultivate

59:41.440 --> 59:43.440
and what kind of value

59:43.440 --> 59:45.440
I can contribute.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.440
Your plan will reflect

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.440
your ambition and vision.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.440
So it's important to create a vision.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.440
In this picture,

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.440
I just showed you

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.440
what I said in my self-introduction.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.440
Let me say it again.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.440
The so-called vision is very important.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.440
What kind of dream

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.440
do you want to achieve

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440
through this plan?

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.440
For example, you are a doctor.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.440
You want to cure cancer

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.440
and save all humans.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.440
It sounds very ambitious.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.440
It sounds very ambitious.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.440
But in fact, this plan

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.440
hopes that you have

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.440
such an ambition.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.440
It also hopes that you can

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.440
challenge what others can't.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.440
So don't think

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.440
what you wrote

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.440
is unlikely to happen.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.440
As long as you think

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.440
your idea is good

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.440
and helpful to humans,

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.440
and you are confident

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.440
that you can make it happen,

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.440
you should write this plan.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.440
Why did I say that?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.440
It's because

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.440
when my sister applied

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.440
for a college in the U.S.,

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.440
she thought

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.440
she wasn't good enough

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.440
to apply for a good school.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.440
So she asked

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.440
her school's consultant.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440
The consultant told her

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.440
whether she was good enough

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440
wasn't up to her.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440
It's the job of the consultant.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.440
So she encouraged her sister

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.440
to apply for a good school.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.440
Don't give up

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.440
because you think you can't do it.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.440
I want to tell you

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.440
don't give up

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.440
because you think

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440
your plan is not good enough.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.440
It's up to the consultant

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.440
to decide

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.440
whether you are good enough

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.440
or not.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.440
Don't give up any chance.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.440
Let's go back to

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.440
the application process

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.440
and the past performance.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.440
Now,

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.440
I'm going to talk about

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.440
the past research performance.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.440
The past research performance

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440
is about

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.440
what papers

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.440
you submitted

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.440
in the past research.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.440
Of course, this is a superficial idea.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.440
You need to look at

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.440
your research

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.440
in the past research.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.440
Why is your research important?

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.440
So,

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.440
I'm going to echo

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.440
what I just said.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.440
Your past research

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.440
gave the

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.440
reviewer

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440
a direction.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.440
Through your past research performance,

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.440
you got some credits.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.440
These credits

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.440
make the reviewer believe

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.440
you can do it in the future.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.440
So,

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.440
when you are writing a research plan,

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.440
you need to

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.440
have a background

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440
to explain

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440
your experience

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.440
in solving

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440
this problem.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.440
What international teams

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.440
did you work with

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.440
in the past research?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.440
What important journals

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.440
did you publish

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.440
in the past research?

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.440
How many credits

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.440
did you get in the past research?

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.440
What honors

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.440
did you get

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.440
in the past research?

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.440
How hard is it to get these honors?

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.440
You need to explain

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.440
to the reviewer.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.440
Sometimes,

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.440
you may think

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
these honors are important

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440
in your field,

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.440
but the reviewer

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.440
may not know.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.440
For example,

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.440
he may not know

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.440
what is the

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.440
Wu Moqing Prize.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440
It is just a

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440
certificate of excellence.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.440
The name of the

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440
sponsor is

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.440
Wu Moqing.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.440
So, when you

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.440
describe your honors,

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.440
you need to explain

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.440
how hard it is

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.440
to get these honors.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.440
The people who

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.440
get these honors

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.440
are from

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.440
world-renowned academic institutions.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.440
For example,

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440
I got a

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.440
Zuckerman Fellowship

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.440
in my postdoc.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.440
The people who get

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.440
this fellowship

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.440
are from

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440
MIT, Harvard,

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.440
or Stanford.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440
So, when I write

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.440
these honors,

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.440
the reviewer

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.440
will know

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.440
that I was

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.440
trustworthy.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.440
In other words,

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.440
I did not

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.440
lie.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.440
When you say

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440
you want to do

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.440
something great,

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.440
why do people

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.440
believe you?

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440
Because you did

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440
something great.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440
The third part

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.440
is the

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.440
Global Cooperation Experience

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.440
and the Future Plans

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.440
of the International

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.440
Academy,

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.440
Professional Society,

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.440
and Important Jobs.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.440
Sorry,

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.440
my PowerPoint

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440
is a bit messy.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.440
Let's continue.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440
Global Cooperation Experience

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.440
and the Future Plans

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.440
of the International Academy

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.440
is a part of the Columbus Project,

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440
but I recommend

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.440
people applying for

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.440
the Einstein Project

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.440
to refer to it.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.440
When you are

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.440
writing a project,

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.440
you need to

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.440
write a research background.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.440
You can emphasize

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.440
which teams

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.440
you worked with

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.440
in the field.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.440
It is important

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.440
to know what problems

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.440
you have solved together.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.440
You need to

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.440
make a name for yourself.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.440
If you get

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.440
the project,

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.440
will you

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.440
continue

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.440
to work with

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.440
international scholars?

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.440
For example,

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.440
will you invite

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.440
international scholars

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.440
to give a speech

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.440
or a workshop

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.440
in Taiwan?

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.440
Will you

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.440
bring international

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.440
research and development

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.440
to Taiwan?

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.440
This is important

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.440
when you are

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.440
writing a project.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.440
If you get

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.440
the approval of

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.440
these scholars,

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440
you can include

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.440
your name, email,

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.440
or even your signature

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440
in your project.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440
This will increase

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440
the credibility of

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.440
your project.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.440
Your reviewer

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.440
will be able to

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.440
trust you

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.440
when they see

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.440
the teams

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.440
you worked with

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.440
in the past.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.440
Next is

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.440
the future plan

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.440
for international scholars

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.440
or professional organizations.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.440
You can write

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.440
your experience

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.440
as an SCI

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440
or SSCI editor,

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.440
organizer,

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.440
host,

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.440
or agent.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.440
For example,

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440
I have a friend

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440
who worked

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.440
as a conference

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.440
host

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.440
in Taiwan.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.440
He wrote

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.440
his experience

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.440
and was

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.440
recognized by

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.440
the reviewer.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.440
If you have

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.440
held a similar

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.440
conference,

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440
don't be shy

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440
and try to

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.440
write your experience

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.440
as an SCI

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.440
or SSCI editor.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440
For example,

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.440
how many articles

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.440
you have reviewed,

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.440
how many meetings

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440
you have held,

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.440
how many cooperation

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.440
plans you have created,

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.440
or even

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.440
whether you are

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440
able to lead

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.440
cross-domain

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.440
or cross-team

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.440
in the past.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440
Here,

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.440
Columbus

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.440
asks you

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.440
your future plan

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.440
for relevant positions.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.440
So,

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.440
you have to

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.440
explain

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.440
how to use

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.440
your past experience

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.440
as an editor,

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.440
reviewer,

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.440
or SCI

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.440
to improve

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.440
Taiwan's academic ability.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.440
As we all know,

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.440
being an academic editor

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440
or

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.440
being

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.440
an

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.440
academic leader

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.440
has a very

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.440
important role

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.440
in improving

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.440
Taiwan's academic status.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.440
For example,

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.440
you can recommend

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440
foreign scholars

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440
to do research

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.440
in Taiwan.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.440
So,

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.440
being an academic leader

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440
is very important.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440
So,

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.440
when you write your plan,

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.440
you can try to

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.440
figure out

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.440
how to become

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.440
an academic leader

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.440
and how to

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.440
achieve this goal.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.440
Next,

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440
Columbus asks you

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440
your future plan

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440
for relevant positions.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440
So,

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.440
you have to

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440
explain

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440
your past experience

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440
as an editor,

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.440
reviewer,

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.440
or SCI to improve

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.440
Taiwan's academic ability.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440
As we all know,

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440
being an academic leader

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440
has a very important role

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.440
in improving

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.440
Taiwan's academic status.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440
So,

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440
you have to

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.440
explain your past experience

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.440
as an editor,

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.440
reviewer,

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440
or SCI to improve

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440
Taiwan's academic ability.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440
Next,

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.440
Columbus asks you

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440
your future plan

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.440
for relevant positions.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.440
So,

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.440
you have to

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440
explain your past experience

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.440
as an editor,

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.440
reviewer,

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.440
or SCI to improve

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.440
Taiwan's academic ability.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.440
So,

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.440
you have to

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.440
explain your past experience

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440
as an editor,

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.440
reviewer,

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.440
or SCI to improve

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.440
Taiwan's academic ability.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.440
So,

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.440
you don't have to

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.440
explain your past experience

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.440
as an editor,

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.440
reviewer,

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.440
or SCI to improve

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.440
Taiwan's academic ability.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.440
So,

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.440
you don't have to

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.440
explain your past experience

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.440
as an editor,

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440
reviewer,

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440
or SCI to improve

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440
Taiwan's academic ability.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.440
So,

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.440
not only can I

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.440
lead Taiwan's students

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.440
to research,

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440
I can also

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.440
work with students

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.440
from different countries,

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440
different religious backgrounds,

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440
and even different skin colors.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.440
So,

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.440
So,

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.440
what kind of research

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440
did these people do

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.440
under your leadership?

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.440
You can talk about

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.440
all of these.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.440
Another part is that

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.440
if you have a lecture,

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440
don't be shy.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440
You can just bring it up

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440
and let SCI know.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.440
Why?

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.440
Because the foundation of

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.440
research teams and training

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.440
is very important.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.440
How do you teach?

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.440
How do you mentor?

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.440
If you have a TA award,

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.440
you can talk about

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.440
what kind of problems

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.440
you encountered in the course of teaching,

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.440
what changes you made,

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.440
and how your team

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.440
worked well.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440
Also,

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.440
you can talk about

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.440
your research results.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440
So,

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.440
I hope you can

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.440
talk about

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.440
your past experiences

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.440
so that SCI

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.440
can clearly understand

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.440
that you have the ability

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.440
to build and train your team.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.440
Yuxu,

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440
hold on.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.440
We have 10 minutes left.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.440
This segment is a bit long.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.440
Let's stop here.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.440
If you have

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.440
any additional questions,

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.440
you can email me.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.440
I can answer

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.440
your questions individually.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.440
Yuxu's email

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440
is here.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.440
You can copy it.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.440
If you want to copy it,

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440
I can listen to it.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.440
You can write your email

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.440
or if you have

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.440
any questions, you can chat.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.440
If we have time,

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.440
we can come back and continue.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.440
We have one more question.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.440
I believe

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.440
everyone cares about

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.440
whether our speakers

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.440
have experience in

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.440
other countries or

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.440
Europe or

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.440
Israel.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.440
What do they think

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.440
about the cultural differences

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.440
between Taiwan and

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.440
other places

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.440
in terms of

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.440
industry and

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.440
industry energy?

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440
How do they decide

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.440
to return to Taiwan

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.440
or stay abroad?

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440
Or how do they see

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.440
the future development?

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440
Let's start with Hao Wei.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440
Okay, no problem.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.440
I think

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.440
your question is

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.440
about the difference

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.440
between Taiwan and

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.440
the United States

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.440
in terms of

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.440
industry and

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.440
industry energy.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.440
Hello?

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.440
Can you hear me?

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.440
If you can hear me,

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440
you can continue.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.440
I'm just repeating your question.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.440
Okay.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.440
I think

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.440
as a Taiwanese,

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440
we always think

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.440
even if I stay here

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.440
for 10 years,

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.440
I still think

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440
I might return to Taiwan one day.

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440
I think Taiwan's energy

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.440
is quite strong

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.440
when it comes to

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.440
industry and industry energy.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440
So I actually thought

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.440
I might return to Taiwan one day.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.440
But the biggest difference

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.440
is probably

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.440
the capital

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.440
and the

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.440
idea of

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.440
starting a business

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.440
is quite different.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.440
So the size of the company

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.440
and the idea of investors

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.440
are quite different.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.440
So the capital

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.440
and the business talent

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.440
are probably more professional

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440
when it comes to the company's valuation.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.440
On the other hand,

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.440
in terms of business,

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.440
Boston's energy

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.440
is really strong.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440
It's one of the best places in the world.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.440
So

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440
it takes a lot of capital

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440
to do the research.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.440
So it's just starting in Taiwan.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.440
So we have a lot of BTBA

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.440
friends who will return to Taiwan

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.440
to help

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.440
build these things.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.440
So I hope one day

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.440
we can really build up

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440
Taiwan's biotechnology

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.440
or medical technology.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.440
I think even though we're still in the US,

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.440
we can still help a lot

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.440
with these links.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.440
Yeah, that's it.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.440
I have a question.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440
Sorry.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.440
Let me adjust my network.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.440
Why is it like this?

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.440
Sorry.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.440
Can you hear me?

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.440
Yes.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440
My question is

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440
about

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440
wanting to return to Taiwan.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440
Do you have any experience

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.440
or have you heard

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.440
whether Taiwan's current industry

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.440
or the government

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.440
has any

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.440
willingness to cooperate

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.440
or any plans

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440
for Taiwan?

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440
What are their motives?

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.440
I think

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.440
after Minister Chen Liangji took office,

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.440
he proposed a lot of

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.440
plans

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.440
for returning to Taiwan.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.440
So he can

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.440
let you find a job for a year

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.440
and then you can find

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
the job you really want to do.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.440
He has provided some plans

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.440
to make it more smooth.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.440
So I think it's not bad.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.440
OK.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.440
But when it comes to

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.440
job opportunities,

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440
it really depends

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440
on the industry.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.440
The prices in the US are higher,

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.440
so you usually get paid when you go back.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.440
But this is expected.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.440
Yeah.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.440
OK.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.440
So do you think,

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.440
at least as you mentioned,

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.440
the government

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.440
has expressed its willingness

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.440
and actually has plans

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.440
to help you

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.440
return to Taiwan

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.440
or get a job in Taiwan?

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.440
Yes.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.440
It's called LIFT.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.440
Oh, OK. LIFT.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.440
You can check it out.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.440
I've heard of it before.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440
I'm not familiar with it,

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440
but I'm sure you can find it on the Internet.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.440
Can we ask Mu-Jie

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.440
about your experience in Europe

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440
and in the US

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.440
since you've just been here for a year?

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.440
What do you think is the difference?

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.440
What do you think is the difference

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.440
between good and bad

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.440
and what do you think?

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.440
I think

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.440
in the US

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440
or other places other than Taiwan,

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.440
I think everyone knows

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.440
that the salary is higher.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.440
In the US,

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440
you have the smartest people

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.440
in the world.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.440
Most of the outstanding students

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.440
are in the US.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.440
I don't think

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.440
we need to emphasize the benefits.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.440
But I think

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440
now,

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.440
especially in the academic world,

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.440
if you're willing to come back

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.440
at this time,

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.440
I think it's a good opportunity.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.440
The reason is that the current minister

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.440
and the overall social atmosphere

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.440
probably all know

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.440
that fewer and fewer people

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.440
are willing to come back.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.440
I'm not just talking about

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.440
the Colombo-Einstein project.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.440
It's not that everyone can get it.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.440
But regardless of

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.440
your general plan,

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.440
in fact,

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.440
there are quite a few

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440
increases in salary and annual income.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.440
But in my own field,

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.440
in the past,

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.440
you might have a one-year or two-year plan.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.440
But now, the meaning of the minister

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.440
is to give people

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.440
three or even four years.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.440
The amount of salary

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.440
will be higher than before.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.440
In addition,

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.440
the current social atmosphere

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.440
has been saying that

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.440
the salary of professors in Taiwan

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.440
is very low.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440
Now,

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440
all professors in Taiwan

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.440
still have the same standard

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.440
of paying salary.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.440
But each school

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.440
actually has

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.440
a lot of different

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.440
basic salary plans.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.440
So I think

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.440
at least in the early stages,

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.440
you don't have to worry

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.440
too much about money.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440
Whether it's research money

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440
or your salary money,

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.440
you don't have to worry too much.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.440
Of course, in terms of absolute numbers,

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.440
it's impossible to compare

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.440
with the U.S. or other countries

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.440
because the prices are different.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.440
So I don't think

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.440
you need to worry about this.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.440
When I came back before,

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.440
or other young professors

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.440
told me that

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.440
Taiwan's current atmosphere

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.440
is more and more like

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.440
as long as you do well,

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.440
you don't have to worry

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.440
about your salary

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.440
or your research money.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.440
There must be

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440
a lot of different

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.440
flexible salary plans.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.440
For example,

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.440
I know someone

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440
who is a professor in Taiwan.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.440
If you really do well,

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.440
there are a lot of different bonuses.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.440
There are some additional bonuses.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.440
After you get the bonuses,

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.440
technology will match

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.440
your research money.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.440
There are

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.440
other professors

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.440
who told me that

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.440
the advantage of Taiwan,

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.440
especially in the academic world,

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.440
is that you have a high chance

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.440
to pass your plan.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.440
But at least

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440
you can do

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.440
what you want to do.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.440
Of course, if you say

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.440
you need 30 million or more devices

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.440
to do an experiment,

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.440
that's another story.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440
But in general,

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.440
I saw Zhang Yanyong shaking his head.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.440
In general,

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.440
there should be no problem.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.440
I and Ye Yong

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.440
are shaking our heads.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.440
I didn't see the other one.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440
I think this is the current

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440
atmosphere in Taiwan.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440
I think

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440
I wanted to come back

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.440
for a part of the reason.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440
I don't know if you know

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.440
Chen Yunlong,

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440
who often appears on TV.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.440
The reason is very similar.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.440
I like living in Taiwan.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.440
I like living in Taiwan,

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.440
so I'm willing to come back.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.440
At that time, I thought

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.440
if I stayed in the United States,

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.440
I would only go to the industry.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.440
If I really want to be a teacher,

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.440
I will think I want to go back to Taiwan.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440
Because I think

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.440
if I want to teach the next generation,

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.440
I will want to teach

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.440
people on my own land.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.440
I don't know if you have seen it.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.440
Yuan Jian also reported that

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.440
Chen Yunlong's mother

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.440
said that

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440
if he didn't come back,

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.440
his mother would tell him that

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.440
she could only see him

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.440
in Taiwan.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.440
I know when you are young,

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.440
you think it's good to travel abroad.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.440
But I have discussed with

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.440
some people around me.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.440
Many people think

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.440
if I stay in the U.S. or abroad

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.440
for 10 or 15 years,

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.440
I still want to come back.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.440
It depends on

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.440
whether you are willing to

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.440
take these 10 or 15 years

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440
to spend time with your family

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.440
and friends

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.440
or if you are willing to

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.440
find a job in the U.S.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.440
or other countries.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.440
Whether it's economic or

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.440
other aspects,

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.440
it's a better return.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.440
I don't think this is wrong.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.440
It's just that everyone's

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.440
views are different.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.440
Overall, I think that

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.440
Taiwan's support for young teachers

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.440
is quite high.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.440
This also involves another thing.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.440
If you are really willing to

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.440
travel abroad,

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.440
you may want to

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.440
inquire about the atmosphere

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.440
of each school.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.440
The atmosphere of

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.440
different schools

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.440
may be different.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.440
You may want to

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.440
inquire about

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.440
the support for young people.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440
I am quite lucky that

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.440
our school is quite good.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.440
Some places may be worse.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.440
You may want to

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.440
find a job in the U.S.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.440
or other countries.

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.440
It's a good return.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.440
It's a good time.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.440
Actually,

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.440
we are running out of time.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.440
I think we have covered

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.440
a lot of interesting points today.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.440
Of course,

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.440
everyone still has a lot of questions.

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.440
Otherwise,

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.440
can we ask the three speakers

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.440
to summarize in two or three minutes

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.440
what they think about

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.440
changing the job of

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.440
PhD students and post-doctorate students?

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.440
In the process of summarizing,

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.440
everyone can think about

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.440
if there are any questions.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.440
You can type them in the chat.

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.440
At the end,

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.440
we will have a short Q&A.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.440
Let's start with Yuxun.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.440
I think

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.440
the global population is expanding.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.440
There are 7 billion people now.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.440
Even if it is a school,

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.440
it is difficult to promote.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.440
Although I am

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.440
a survivor,

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.440
it is not very convincing.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.440
But what I want to say is

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.440
don't be too persistent

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.440
and have to go a certain way.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.440
Let yourself stay flexible.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.440
When I was studying

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.440
for a master's degree,

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440
I spent a lot of time

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.440
studying stock trading.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.440
So I thought about

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.440
if I want to do research,

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440
whether I do research or not,

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.440
I need money.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.440
If I do research,

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440
it is difficult to make a fortune.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.440
So if I invest in finance,

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.440
I can maintain my basic living expenses.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440
It feels good, right?

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.440
In addition to studying finance,

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.440
I also attend

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440
some

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.440
lectures

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.440
on communication skills.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440
To sum up,

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.440
don't go too far

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.440
and try to

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.440
stay flexible.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.440
As I said at the beginning,

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.440
do what you want to do,

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.440
but do it in the right way.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.440
Go in the direction you want to go.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.440
But don't set the direction

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440
too narrow.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.440
Make it a wider direction.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.440
Don't make

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.440
precise mistakes

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.440
even if it is wrong.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440
This is what I want to

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440
share with you today.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.440
Don't ask me

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.440
what I want.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.440
I have invested in stocks for so many years.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440
Hello?

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.440
Can you hear me?

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.440
Can you hear me?

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.440
I can hear you now.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.440
Can you

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.440
summarize

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.440
your thoughts?

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440
Okay, no problem.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440
I think

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.440
it is good

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.440
that everyone is willing to

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.440
participate in this event.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.440
I think the most important part

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.440
of NPS is networking.

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.440
You need to get to know more people

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.440
and know what everyone is doing.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.440
After graduation,

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.440
these networks will continue to grow.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.440
For a long time,

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.440
like what they said,

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.440
Ph.D. is looking for the next job.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.440
70% of them are introduced by people they know.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.440
So,

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.440
networking is really important.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.440
I hope everyone can

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.440
get to know more people

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.440
and know more about what this world is doing

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440
in the life of a postdoc or PhD.

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.440
Of course,

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.440
the academic world is really competitive.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.440
According to statistics,

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.440
those who can become

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.440
a professor

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.440
are the top 10%.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.440
Many people will eventually

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.440
enter the industry,

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.440
but there are still many opportunities

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.440
for you to develop

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.440
and do what you want to do.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.440
So, I hope everyone can explore more.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.440
And there are many

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.440
top things

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.440
that you can do.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.440
This is really cool.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.440
Thank you, Hao Wei.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.440
Mu Jie, please summarize.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.440
No problem.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.440
I don't think what Hao Wei said is right.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.440
I don't think

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.440
the top 10%

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.440
come to the academic world.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.440
I think a big part

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.440
is that everyone's career path

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.440
is different.

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.440
Many people who are better than me

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.440
eventually choose to go to the industry.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.440
Then I can find

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.440
something to live for.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.440
Actually, I think

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.440
my point of view is very similar

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.440
to what Yuxin said.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.440
I think

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440
you have to choose

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440
what you really want to do.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.440
No matter

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.440
if you choose a research topic

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.440
or whether you want to go to the industry or the classroom.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.440
I think this is a very important thing.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.440
Especially when you can still choose,

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.440
it's actually a very happy thing.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.440
So when you can choose,

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.440
try to choose what you think you're interested in.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.440
Because I think what you're interested in

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.440
is what you're willing to spend time and effort

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.440
to do it well.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.440
Because when you're a professor,

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.440
it's actually quite tiring.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.440
Because there are a lot of mixed things.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.440
But when you like to do this,

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.440
you can really do it well.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.440
I also think what Yuxin said

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.440
is very good.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.440
Don't worry about

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.440
giving yourself

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440
the courage

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.440
to correct your direction.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.440
Correcting earlier

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.440
is always better than correcting later.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.440
Don't feel like

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.440
I have to be a professor.

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.440
In the end, you really can't be a professor.

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.440
Or no matter what the reason is,

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.440
you decide not to be a professor.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.440
Don't be afraid of what others will think.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.440
Because no one will be responsible for your life.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.440
Only you have to be responsible for your own life.

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.440
So I think the most important thing

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.440
is actually this.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.440
Thank you.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440
I think the three speakers

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.440
talked very well today.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.440
Please turn on the microphone now

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.440
so that the speakers can hear our applause.

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.440
Please give a round of applause

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.440
to thank the three speakers

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.440
for sharing with us today.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.440
Thank you.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.440
Because our time today

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.440
is a bit short,

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.440
but I guess there are still people who want to discuss,

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.440
so I will turn off the recording first.
