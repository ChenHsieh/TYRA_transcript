00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Chair Talk.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Our speaker today is Shuyu He.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Shuyu is now doing theoretical physics at Tohoku University in Tokyo, Japan.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He specializes in the theory of dark matter.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Shuyu He is actually a long-time friend of mine.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm today's host, Zhang Yanyou.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Shuyu He majored in physics.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
After graduating from physics, he went to Taiwan University to do his master's degree in dark matter.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He followed up with Mr. He Xiaoguang.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then he came to Caltech and met me.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now he's doing his PhD at Tohoku.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't know if I'm saying this correctly, but he should be graduating soon, right?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Next year, in September.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, he's graduating soon.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The topic he's going to talk to us about today is

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hidden Monopole Dark Matter via XCO Portal and its Implications for Direct Search and Bind-Up Experiments.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This paper is actually already published in the archive.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you look at the first page of the video, you can see the archive number.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, by the way, when you clap, you have to turn on the microphone.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Only then can we hear you clap.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Shuyu He to give us a wonderful speech today.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you, Zhang Yanyou, for introducing me.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
As you can see, the title of my speech is quite long.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let me talk about a few key points first.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My speech today will focus on dark matter.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Dark Matter is the Chinese translation of dark matter.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think if you don't usually do theoretical work, you should hear this term a lot.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe through some of Taiwan's programs, you may hear the term dark matter.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then you can see this hidden monopole in front of you.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Monopole is the Chinese translation of the word monopole.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you have studied electronics, you will know that when we discuss electronics, we do not have a monopole.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hidden, I will explain what it means.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then there is action.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In my last speech, I basically made a long introduction.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But today, because of time, I should mainly focus on the introduction of dark matter.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So action, I might first mention it a little bit.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Then I will talk about the details of our model.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It is also applied in DirectSearch.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That is, directly detect the experiment of dark matter and the so-called Bindang Experiments.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will mention these details at the end.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go straight to the introduction of dark matter.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What you see on the screen now is our so-called example physical standard model.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Generally called Standard Model.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This model has been verified by a large number of experiments.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It is a very accurate theory.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Simply put, you can look at this picture.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Look at this E, this E is the so-called Electron.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is the basic example that everyone is familiar with.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The focus is on Mu and Tau.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
These examples are actually easy to find in the universe.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then there is the so-called Mu, E, Mu, Mu and Mu, Tau is the so-called neutral value.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is generally more unfamiliar.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But I won't touch this part in today's speech.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can see that the red part above is the so-called Quarks.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Like this straight neutral value that everyone is more familiar with.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Basically they are not basic examples.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They are composed of these Quarks.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
For example, this Proton is composed of two Up Quarks and one Down Quark.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That is the U and D on the graph.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There are heavier Quarks in the graph.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The purple part on the right side of the graph is the so-called basic force.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Everyone is more familiar with this Gamma.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That is the particle in the upper right corner.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It is the battery function that we are more familiar with.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The G below is the so-called強作用.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Z and W are the so-called weakest.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In this regard, these two particles may not be often heard of.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Basically, today I am more focused on this Photon part.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will introduce the so-called Hidden Photon later.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There is a Higgs in the middle of this graph.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You may hear this news often.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There is a report like this.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This Higgs is the source of the so-called Origin of Mass.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's why matter has mass.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This Higgs has been predicted to exist for a long time.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The reason is that before it was discovered,

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the history of standard models has been verified for a long time.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It is a very accurate theory.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But this Higgs has not been discovered.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is the motivation for us to find it.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So I built a large-scale quantum detector in Europe later.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The so-called LHC.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I spent a lot of money on it.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I found it in 2013.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If I remember correctly, it was six or five years ago.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know. It should be 2014.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What I want to say is that we should be able to see your mouse.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So you can move your mouse.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You can try it.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can use it if you want.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you for your advice.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Higgs was discovered in 2014.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Then, of course, the next year,

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
it seems that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Higgs.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It means that the last puzzle of the standard model has been found.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Although the standard model is so successful,

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
there are still many problems that cannot be explained.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
These problems are listed on the right side of this video.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There are quite a lot.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like the first so-called dark matter.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll talk about why I want to have dark matter.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There is also the so-called dark energy.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Dark energy is currently an explanation of why the universe is accelerating.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We observe that the universe is not static.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It is constantly expanding.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The only explanation is dark energy.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Simply put, it may provide some

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
similar

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
anti-gravity feeling.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There is also the so-called quantum gravity.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There is also the so-called gravity problem.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There is also the so-called gravity problem.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There is also the so-called gravity problem.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There is also the so-called gravity asymmetry.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In other words, our universe.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Our universe has the so-called anti-matter and positive matter.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But we found that our universe is basically dominant.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This matter is not anti-matter.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is also the reason why we can't know.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is a problem.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But although there are so many questions.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
My speech today is mainly focused on dark matter.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you are interested in this question, you can google it.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can know more details.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Since we are talking about dark matter, we must do some basic introduction of dark matter.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
First of all, let's talk about why we know the existence of dark matter.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It may be easier for everyone to understand the upper left corner of this picture.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The upper left corner is the rotation curve of the star system.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can see the shape of this picture.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Its tangent axis is a planet

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
revolving around the rotation speed of the star system.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The horizontal axis is the distance between the star system and the center of the galaxy.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
According to Newton's law and Newton's law of gravitation,

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
we can simply calculate that the rotation speed of the star system should be reduced.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If it is a galaxy, it should be reduced.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But what we find is not the red line, but the white line on the graph.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This may imply that there are some objects that we can't see.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It also provides gravity.

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This gravity will produce additional gravitation to keep the star system at a certain speed.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is the most basic evidence of dark matter.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In addition, there is a so-called gravity path.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
For example, if the dark matter is in the universe,

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it will cause some stars to shine.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The light will be distorted by the dark matter.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We can see the circular effect in the picture.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is the so-called gravity effect.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There is also the CMB spectrum in the lower left corner.

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is more detailed.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I can skip it first.

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The one on the bottom right is quite famous.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Someone once considered that there may be no dark matter,

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but that Newton's law needs to be corrected.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There is also the so-called modified gravity theory.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Britt-Crosser is a more preferable evidence of dark matter.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You can see that Britt-Crosser has a pink and purple part on the graph.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The purple part is basically the matter that will provide gravity.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
In other words, I just talked about the gravitational projection above.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We can know by gravitational projection that some invisible matter will provide gravity.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That is the purple part of the graph.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The red part is some visible matter that we know.

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It may be electrons or some light.

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We can detect it through binoculars or satellites.

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We found that these two crosses coincide.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We found that the red part will interact with each other.

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The purple part will just go through each other.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In other words, it will not have the same effect as our matter.

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
For example, this may also provide evidence that there is a very weak matter in the universe.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's called dark matter.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Anyway, we found a lot of evidence from experiments or observations.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So dark matter is not just an evidence.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Its evidence is very overwhelming.

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Since we believe in the existence of dark matter, we want to measure some of its data.

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
At present, according to our so-called cosmological standard model.

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We just talked about the standard model of gravitational physics.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There is a standard model of cosmology.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Under that model, we do the measurement.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We found that the current energy ratio of the universe is like the picture.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
This is what you see on the screen right now.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We generally call it cosmic pi.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We found that 70% of the universe's energy is contributed by dark energy.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Dark matter contributes about one-fourth.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Only 5% is contributed by the so-called barrier.

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In other words, most of the universe can see the so-called stars.

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It only accounts for 5% of the total energy.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Anyway, the focus of our speech today is on dark matter.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
As long as you know that dark matter accounts for about one-fourth of the universe's energy.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What characteristics does dark matter need to meet?

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
First of all, I just said that we can't see it because of dark matter.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So it can't have a battery interaction.

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Otherwise, we should be able to easily measure the signal with a device.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So this tells us that dark matter should be an electromagnetic.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It can't carry electricity.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then again, its age must be older than the age of the universe.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or it's very stable.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Otherwise, if it changes, like we know some basic examples.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's not stable.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Uh, like the one on the screen just now.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
In that standard model, it's called the second value.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
For example, the second value can change to the electron.

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Add some neutrons.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So some particles are not stable.

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So if dark matter is not stable, it might change.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If I change, it might disappear.

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Then we won't see it.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So basically, it has to be long enough for you.

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In addition, from what I just said, this CMB.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And some early observations of the universe's nuclear fusion.

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We found that it is a non-atomic substance.

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not like the quarks we just talked about.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That kind of thing.

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And finally, the so-called star structure is formed.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We estimate its movement speed.

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
In other words, particles should move in the universe.

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like the quarks I just mentioned.

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It has its own velocity.

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But the result of our observation is that our dark matter.

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Its movement speed must be very small.

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's almost as small as the speed of light.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But to put it more directly.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's almost as fast as the speed of light.

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Compared to the speed of light.

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This is easy to understand.

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Do you know that dark matter itself has gravity?

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If there is gravity.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
They may continue to attract.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And form some kind of cluster feeling.

228
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If the dark matter forms a cluster.

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Other things like particles.

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Some gravitational materials will also be attracted.

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you are attracted.

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It will slowly form a star system.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Then this star system becomes what we are now.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That is to say, these stars are observed in the universe.

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I found that most of the stars are large.

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Most of the stars are large-diameter structures.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That means that the dark matter must move very slowly.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Because if the dark matter moves very fast.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's hard to form a cluster.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If it's hard to form a cluster.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What we should see is.

242
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
A star with a relatively small-diameter structure.

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Not large-diameter.

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So the observation of large-diameter structures.

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Dark matter moves very slowly.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is basically the nature of dark matter.

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why is this nature important?

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Because I just talked about the standard model.

249
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There is no way to explain dark matter.

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So it means that the standard model must be extended.

251
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So you have to write some models.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When you write a model.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You have to make your model.

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Some new substances.

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
New particles to meet these characteristics.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is the basic knowledge we need to know when we do theory.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There is no problem here.

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Does anyone want to know about dark matter?

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It seems that everyone can accept it.

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Then I will continue.

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Since we just talked about modeling.

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Our theorists.

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Have to come up with some.

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Models or scenarios to explain.

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is dark matter?

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
More popular is the so-called.

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Weakly Interactive Massive Particle.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Generally referred to as WIMP.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why is WIMP more popular?

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Because.

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you use theory to estimate.

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Find this kind of particle.

273
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What about the effectiveness?

274
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's very close to what I just said in the first page.

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
At the same time, the quality is also very close.

276
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So this WIMP will be very.

277
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Close to the extent of our so-called circuit theory.

278
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is actually more likely to be experimentally.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Go.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Measure.

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Of course, there are many.

282
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This kind of example.

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's like the so-called supersymmetry theory.

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's like the so-called.

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Some additional symmetry theory will also predict this kind of WIMP.

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Candidate.

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Then below me.

288
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The blue part is.

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Is.

290
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Different from this kind of WIMP.

291
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Candidate.

292
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's what I'm talking about today.

293
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm talking about this hidden.

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Basically, it's a.

295
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Torque defect.

296
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's a topological defect.

297
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's very different from the general WIMP.

298
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's even in the early universe.

299
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The mechanism is also very different.

300
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll mention it a little bit later.

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Simply put, I can simply say.

302
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
WIMP is basically.

303
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It was created by heat balance in the early days.

304
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You can imagine that the universe was a big.

305
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There are a lot of particles.

306
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There are electrons and light.

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Then these particles have high energy.

308
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then these high energy can hit some.

309
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Heavier particles.

310
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's how WIMP was created in the early universe.

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's right.

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So what about these torque defects?

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What about the axis?

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Its formation mechanism is not the same as WIMP.

315
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then I will explain.

316
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then I don't want blue.

317
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's because of these.

318
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Particles are constantly mentioned in the back.

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Like the axis and the invisible light.

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I didn't particularly talk about what is HIDDEN.

321
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
HIDDEN is a sector of the visible world.

322
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For example, I just talked about the role of the battery.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Then we can.

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
WIMP is very thematic.

325
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I can say that there may be another.

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
A weaker battery.

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Then I call it HIDDEN.

328
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Electromagnetic.

329
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then you will naturally have HIDDEN photons.

330
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Then there are a lot of candidates.

331
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like SIMP.

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
SIMP is Strongly Integrated Massive Particles.

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I also sent a few papers on this work a few years ago.

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It seems that my first TAL speech is about SIMP.

335
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Then there are so-called Gravity Nodes.

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There are a lot of things like this.

337
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Basically, you can write a book.

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Introduce these candidates of Fragment.

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Anyway, I will focus on the blue part today.

340
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Since there is a theory, of course there is also an experiment.

341
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So there are a lot of people in the world right now.

342
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Whether in Japan, the United States or Europe.

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Maybe a lot of time wants to detect dark matter.

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Basically, they don't want to detect the so-called WIMP.

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Because WIMP has more people doing theoretical models.

346
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
More people are doing it.

347
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They all assume that WIMP.

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
In fact, WIMP.

349
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It may have some interaction with the nucleus.

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Of course, these interactions are not direct.

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It may pass through some media.

352
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
These media may be new physics.

353
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Maybe it will pass through some.

354
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Even like the fingertips I just mentioned.

355
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Basically, this is the topic of my speech today.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Through some new.

357
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
New fermions or new bosons.

358
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Particle to do media.

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Then through this media.

360
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Dark matter can interact with the nucleus.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Then we can go.

362
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Do the theoretical calculation.

363
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Then compare with the experiment.

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The so-called experimental comparison is like the picture on the right.

365
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It has.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There are some upper bound.

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Like the one on the picture.

368
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It is.

369
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The three-color interface of WIMP and Nucleon.

370
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Simply put, it's a three-color intensity.

371
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The horizontal axis is the mass of WIMP.

372
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There are a lot of pictures on the Internet.

374
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You see.

375
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are already a lot of things like COPE.

376
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Xenon.

377
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like this.

378
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Uh.

379
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There was this a while ago.

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Uh.

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Xenon OneTown also released some new upper bound.

382
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Like this.

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Anyway, we have a lot of time to measure this dark matter.

384
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Like this.

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay, so this is the current.

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Uh.

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm just going to do the basic.

388
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Background introduction.

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

390
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I want to.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
OK.

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I have a question.

393
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Good question.

394
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But what you're showing now is.

395
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's almost.

396
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
One to 10,000.

397
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
10,000 GEV, right?

398
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes.

399
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Will you discuss it in this range today?

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No, it's a good question.

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No.

402
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But.

403
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I want to.

404
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, because it's actually in.

406
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You see.

407
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You see.

408
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Upper bound.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
In the heavy part.

410
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
His.

411
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The trend is always.

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You can predict that it will continue to go up.

413
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Extend.

414
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's because.

415
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Because.

416
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Uh.

417
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But we know.

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We can fix that.

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Dark matter.

420
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That event.

421
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Is.

422
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Can.

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We can know.

424
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We can press.

425
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Then we can know this.

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Strength.

427
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So you can go.

428
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
To behave this.

429
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He's in.

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What's his behavior in the heavy part?

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
For example, we.

432
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Basically, we're just doing an extension.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Then, of course, because we're talking about this today.

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Monopole.

435
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's very heavy.

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's even more than 10.

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So.

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's right.

439
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But basically.

440
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We just extend this upper bound.

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And then do it like this.

442
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Is that okay?

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay.

444
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you.

445
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Okay.

446
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay.

447
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Then I have no problem.

448
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's just introduce our main character today.

449
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The so-called hidden mobile.

450
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So why do you have to study hidden mobile?

451
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Because it's actually hidden mobile.

452
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
He is.

453
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
To put it bluntly, he's a pretty good candidate.

454
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why?

455
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There are two very simple reasons.

456
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That is.

457
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
He is.

458
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If you are in the universe.

459
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Early.

460
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If there are some changes.

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That is.

462
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It can be very natural.

463
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Okay.

464
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I have a simple picture.

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
To explain this.

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's right.

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You can think of it before the change.

468
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That is.

469
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I.

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I.

471
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The square on this picture.

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This rectangle.

473
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm talking about the universe.

474
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Of course.

475
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's not just empty.

476
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm just saying.

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Before the change.

478
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
His.

479
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This.

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The shape of a factory is.

481
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's zero.

482
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He's got nothing.

483
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's it.

484
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And then after the change.

485
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Maybe.

486
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Well.

487
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Some blocks in the universe.

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Will.

489
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There will be some new ones.

490
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Maybe some.

491
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
New scalar field.

492
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He will send.

493
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There will be some vacuum expectations.

494
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And then this scalar field.

495
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There will be some random directions.

496
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's because the universe.

497
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The universe is.

498
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Do you know that the universe is a cause and effect ratio?

499
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So we'll have some domains.

500
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That these domains are.

501
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Cause.

502
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Causality connection.

503
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Connected.

504
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That is.

505
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It has a cause and effect relationship.

506
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So in different domains.

507
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
His.

508
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The direction may be different.

509
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This is a bit like you.

510
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Maybe.

511
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Electrical engineering or some.

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's your magnet.

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
There will be some.

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That domain phenomenon is very similar.

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Anyway.

516
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So.

517
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
In the following.

518
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,000


519
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I seem to have a typo below.

520
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It should be after the change.

521
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's not before the change.

522
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I just changed it.

523
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

524
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So there's this random direction.

525
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then you might have a certain chance.

526
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's just like.

527
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
In this picture.

528
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The four in the lower right corner.

529
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He just formed a radiation.

530
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
There is no.

531
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's the radiation.

532
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's like our battery factory.

533
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That.

534
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Since there's a battery factory.

535
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We can find the center.

536
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So you can say.

537
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What about this center?

538
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It can be identified.

539
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's a.

540
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Maybe it's a kind of.

541
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Something with a magnet.

542
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

543
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
In our example.

544
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's a magnet.

545
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's got a flux.

546
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah.

547
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So there's this magnet.

548
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It will produce.

549
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It will produce this magnetic field.

550
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So.

551
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
For example, if there is a change.

552
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
These.

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
These.

554
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
These objects will naturally occur.

555
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's the red dot on the picture.

556
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's it.

557
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Then we can estimate.

558
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This number density.

559
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm on the screen.

560
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Uh.

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The data is written.

562
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's this nm.

563
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's this.

564
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The number density of the monopole.

565
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It will.

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It will be equal to this.

567
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
1 divided by this.

568
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Horizontal size of this.

569
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The three-dimensional.

570
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's the volume.

571
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That is to say, roughly.

572
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's probably an average one.

573
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
In a.

574
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
This British law.

575
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Connected.

576
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
In this volume.

577
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It will produce a.

578
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Magnetic field.

579
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That's it.

580
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, that's it.

581
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
This.

582
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This.

583
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This dh.

584
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This horizon distance.

585
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's roughly.

586
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's about the same as this.

587
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This.

588
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This.

589
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Negative three-dimensional.

590
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
That's it.

591
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Then we can estimate.

592
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This number density.

593
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's h.

594
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Negative three-dimensional.

595
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Then we can estimate.

596
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's this.

597
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The density.

598
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I have a question.

599
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Good question.

600
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
My question is.

601
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That is.

602
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
My question is.

603
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The main thing is that molecule.

604
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is 1.

605
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That is to say.

606
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If you are in a causal.

607
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Connected horizon.

608
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There is more than one.

609
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It doesn't look like.

610
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's a monopole.

611
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It looks like.

612
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a dipole.

613
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Or a multipole.

614
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Right?

615
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah, there's a lot of.

616
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

617
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But.

618
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So.

619
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I see.

620
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So.

621
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You would say.

622
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's one over.

623
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Horizon size.

624
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because.

625
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Basically.

626
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You have to.

627
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Usually.

628
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Write a P.

629
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
P is probability.

630
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Uh-huh.

631
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But.

632
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I didn't go.

633
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
To see how to calculate.

634
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That depends on model.

635
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

636
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But I'm just giving it a scale.

637
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah.

638
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Like my paper here.

639
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's just.

640
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's just a number.

641
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I can't.

642
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's not that I can't.

643
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I didn't really go.

644
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Calculate so carefully.

645
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because the reason is simple.

646
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Because.

647
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You know, there are a lot of experiments.

648
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah.

649
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Hahaha.

650
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Sorry.

651
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah.

652
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yeah.

653
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah.

654
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

655
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah.

656
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah.

657
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.

658
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah.

659
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah.

660
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah.

661
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah.

662
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
How much density should this monopole have?

663
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Or is it just density?

664
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Because we know that density.

665
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That's the mass density.

666
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's the mass density.

667
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So it's going to be very natural in the universe.

668
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If there's a change.

669
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

670
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That's actually.

671
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know, there's a lot of change in the universe.

672
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So it's very natural.

673
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's a natural thing.

674
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
If there's the same thing in this hidden sector.

675
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Then this level 13.

676
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
This hidden level 13 can be produced by itself.

677
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's very natural.

678
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And then there's him.

679
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Because he's Thorpe.

680
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Thorpe.

681
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Thorpe.

682
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Thorpe.

683
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So he has a kind of his own.

684
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The nature of Thorpe.

685
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know if you're familiar with Thorpe.

686
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Like Thorpe, which is usually used to talk about Thorpe.

687
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That's Mark Bay.

688
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know, Mark Bay.

689
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's the same as the field circle.

690
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Thorpe is the same.

691
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah.

692
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's a more mathematical language.

693
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That is to say, this kind of Thorpe.

694
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Thorpe's object has its own.

695
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is quantum number.

696
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That's quantum number.

697
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
If it's.

698
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
If it's not destroyed.

699
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's a very good hand.

700
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So if it's a hand, it means.

701
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If this model has this quantum number.

702
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's a very stable thing.

703
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That chemical reaction is not electrical.

704
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You can't.

705
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Before and after the reaction.

706
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Before the reaction, it's very.

707
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Total charge is.

708
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's positive and negative.

709
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And then you get negative after the reaction.

710
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Something like that.

711
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah.

712
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
That can explain the dark matter.

713
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This hidden model.

714
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Why is it stable?

715
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

716
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Because he can't detect some particles.

717
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It also has the same Thorpe.

718
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
This number.

719
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So anyway.

720
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So this is two basic reasons.

721
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's the hidden model.

722
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Good.

723
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Of course.

724
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Uh.

725
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm in the hidden model.

726
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So basically there are some.

727
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Of course, some studies of the same theory.

728
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Like what.

729
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Su5 theory.

730
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
They naturally have some models.

731
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But what about these models?

732
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
If you calculate it, you'll find it.

733
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's going to be a lot.

734
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah.

735
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That's going to lead to.

736
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's going to be the same as we observe.

737
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's going to be different from what we observe.

738
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Because we're in the universe right now.

739
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The universe has no evidence of any particles.

740
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And then that's going to lead to another question.

741
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That's what this is.

742
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Why isn't the universe like this?

743
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
There's no such thing as a general model.

744
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Well, that might have to be generally explained by inferential.

745
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah.

746
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Well, this is another one.

747
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
The bottom line is that the early universe will explode.

748
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And then it's going to suck up the density of this model.

749
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

750
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And here, it's not the same as my hidden model.

751
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah.

752
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Even if I'm in the dark matter.

753
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So.

754
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's going to have a lot of density.

755
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, basically, it's supposed to be.

756
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It has to be produced after this explosion.

757
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If it's produced before the explosion,

758
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's going to be sucked up, too.

759
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
OK.

760
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Good.

761
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's what I was trying to do.

762
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You have a wrong notation.

763
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That DH is.

764
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Equal to H or equal to H minus.

765
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Minus.

766
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It should be minus.

767
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Minus.

768
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Because you don't seem to be right about these two, do you?

769
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I might be writing.

770
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I might be typing.

771
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah, I might have a short time.

772
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah.

773
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Which one is the title?

774
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah, it's supposed to be three-dimensional.

775
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You're talking about that.

776
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah.

777
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Three-dimensional.

778
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
OK.

779
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Good.

780
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Thank you.

781
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Good.

782
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
that.

783
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I just mentioned the experiment.

784
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That is to say, we.

785
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Can we measure this?

786
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
This model can measure this hidden model.

787
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The answer is no.

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Because I just said.

789
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
If you're this dark matter.

790
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Really with.

791
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
What about the effect of this box?

792
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I need some media.

793
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So if it's just a.

794
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Hidden model, this model.

795
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Maybe there's no way.

796
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
There's this connection.

797
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So I don't have to.

798
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Do some extra extension.

799
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That is to say, you have to add extra particles.

800
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah.

801
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Let this model and this box.

802
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There's a connection.

803
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Good.

804
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There are a few possibilities.

805
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Good.

806
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The first one is the Higgs portal.

807
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That is to say.

808
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
In the middle, they rely on Higgs particles to make media.

809
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That's a simple estimate.

810
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm not going to explain it.

811
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That is, I found this prediction.

812
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
This.

813
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The war front is very small.

814
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
There's another one that wants to go through this vector.

815
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
For example, the middle is.

816
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The media is a kind of light.

817
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
These things.

818
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That.

819
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That.

820
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Sorry.

821
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't study because of this.

822
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Toppling is very small because.

823
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
This kind of vector.

824
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's been limited by a lot of experiments.

825
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So it's usually this.

826
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's not big enough.

827
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So our research theme today is.

828
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
This action.

829
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You mean.

830
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This media is made by action.

831
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That action is the most primitive.

832
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The first reason is that he solved it.

833
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Just maybe.

834
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I didn't get this strong CP problem.

835
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah, and then in this hypothesis.

836
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Or some super-symmetry.

837
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's natural to predict this kind of action particle.

838
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah, so.

839
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The action particle may exist in the intelligent world.

840
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, actually, as long as you know the action, it's a simple one.

841
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
There's no, it's a, it's a pure particle.

842
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's it.

843
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's not self-selected.

844
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's a spin-zero particle.

845
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And then it's a pseudo-scalar at the same time.

846
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The so-called pseudo means that it's in this mirror symmetry.

847
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's got a symbol.

848
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I mean.

849
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Uh.

850
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So.

851
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If it's a normal scale, it won't be like Higgs.

852
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Higgs is just a normal scale.

853
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's in.

854
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But the parity is in the mirror symmetry.

855
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It doesn't have a minus sign in the mirror symmetry.

856
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, anyway, so, anyway, so action is a.

857
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's a pseudo-scalar.

858
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So, basically, what I'm doing today is assuming.

859
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This hidden multiple.

860
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
With this, uh, uh, with the middle of the nucleus through this action to make a connection.

861
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh.

862
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Well, then it's a more complex model.

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Then this side.

864
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Maybe a lot of people don't understand.

865
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, I'll talk about it a little bit.

866
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The earliest.

867
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Uh, put it out.

868
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That is to say, a theory is very natural to have multiple.

869
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's this one.

870
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
He's also a theoretical physicist.

871
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He's in the Netherlands.

872
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And then he has a Nobel Prize.

873
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Then he proposed this so-called SU2.

874
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
SU2 is basically a standard symmetry.

875
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, to put it simply, people are more familiar with this battery.

876
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's a U1 symmetry.

877
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That U1, it's a.

878
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's a non-exchange group symmetry.

879
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The so-called exchange is to say.

880
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So, as you know, people have learned to be more familiar with rotation.

881
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Basically, the three-dimensional rotation is a.

882
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The role of a non-exchange group symmetry.

883
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Because you, you first turn from the y-axis and then from the z-axis.

884
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You can turn from the z-axis and then from the y-axis.

885
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's different.

886
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah.

887
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's why U1 is an exchange.

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The exchange is that it's a flat rotation.

889
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Flat rotation is an exchangeable.

890
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That.

891
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, he proposed a SU2.

892
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
This non-exchange group symmetry.

893
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The theory.

894
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And then he added three of these.

895
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
New scale.

896
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
For example, you can see this in the picture.

897
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Phi 1, phi 2, phi 3.

898
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
What about the structure of this theory?

899
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What if this happens?

900
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This self-reliance.

901
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What about the destruction?

902
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It will be very natural to produce this.

903
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That he was a long time ago.

904
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
With another one.

905
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
This.

906
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
This.

907
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This.

908
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
They didn't cooperate before.

909
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
They both came up with this idea.

910
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That's it.

911
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, and then down here is this.

912
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The screen is some of the equations.

913
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You don't really need to.

914
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
To understand.

915
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You just need to know that I'm using pink to mark this.

916
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Like EH.

917
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
EH is similar to our battery.

918
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
The battery.

919
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Just because it's a hidden sector.

920
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So I add an H to mark it.

921
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's different from our average.

922
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
This.

923
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The size of the battery.

924
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And then VH.

925
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
On the right.

926
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The VH on the right is this.

927
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The vacuum expectation value of the storage plant.

928
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That he will.

929
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's related to this.

930
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah.

931
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Anyway, it's a model.

932
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That he will naturally have this.

933
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That's it.

934
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You don't have to look at it.

935
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Of course, it's what I just said.

936
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
This model.

937
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
If there is a self-reliance.

938
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Self-reliance destruction.

939
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Then it will produce U1.

940
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That U1 will become.

941
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Simply put.

942
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That is to say.

943
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The role of our average battery is.

944
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's U1.

945
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
U1 symmetry.

946
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So if he has a U1H.

947
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's natural to have one.

948
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
In the hidden sector.

949
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This battery.

950
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What about this alpha H?

951
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This is the red one.

952
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
This alpha H is.

953
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It should be the economic structure parameter.

954
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

955
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
That's the same.

956
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
He's in the hidden sector right now.

957
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh.

958
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Look at the time.

959
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
About 20 minutes.

960
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Good.

961
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
That's what I just said.

962
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
If this model.

963
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If you assume this model.

964
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
He's this.

965
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Energy is self-reliance.

966
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That is to say.

967
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
If his energy is finite.

968
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That will naturally be a.

969
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Very stable.

970
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
This.

971
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
This state solution.

972
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's like the solution of Soliton.

973
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
He's a model.

974
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And then there's some of this model.

975
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Some new particles.

976
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That's the first one.

977
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Gamma H is hidden photon.

978
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Of course, hidden photon.

979
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's not qualitative.

980
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's not electronic.

981
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's not.

982
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's not.

983
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
There's no magnetic field.

984
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah.

985
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And then this alpha.

986
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This.

987
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This is what I just said.

988
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Some of this model.

989
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Scalar like this.

990
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That's a lot of mass.

991
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But he didn't.

992
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
There's no electric field.

993
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There's no magnetic field.

994
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And then the third one.

995
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
This is.

996
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Standard symmetrical example.

997
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We usually call it W.

998
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The government.

999
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
He's actually talking to us.

1000
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The first page of that standard model.

1001
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That W is very similar.

1002
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That's the same.

1003
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
He's in the hidden sector.

1004
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That.

1005
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's natural.

1006
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He's going to have an electric field.

1007
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah.

1008
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And then the last one, M.

1009
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's our protagonist.

1010
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's the model.

1011
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's natural.

1012
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It has to be qualitative.

1013
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And then since it's a model.

1014
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Of course, it has to have magnetic field.

1015
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's magnetic charge.

1016
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Of course.

1017
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
There's a question here.

1018
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That is to say.

1019
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
If it is.

1020
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He's a.

1021
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
If it's a model.

1022
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Why does he have an electric field?

1023
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's kind of weird.

1024
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's a very interesting theory.

1025
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
He was in Princeton a long time ago.

1026
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Now in Princeton.

1027
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
This Witten.

1028
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
A.

1029
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's one of the most powerful.

1030
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's supposed to be the top linguist.

1031
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
He was a long time ago.

1032
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The so-called Witten effect.

1033
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
For example, through this Witten effect.

1034
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
This monopole.

1035
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It will also have.

1036
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This electric field.

1037
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This is quite interesting.

1038
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
This is when I first learned it.

1039
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I think it's amazing.

1040
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And it's very simple.

1041
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay, so.

1042
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So why is there this.

1043
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Electric field?

1044
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So if you say.

1045
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
If you today.

1046
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
As I just said.

1047
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
If you have one now.

1048
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The theory of this one.

1049
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Basically, we can also write it on the screen.

1050
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This equation.

1051
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
This Lagrangian.

1052
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Okay, so back to the front.

1053
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You see this.

1054
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
The Lagrangian has a cth.

1055
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's cth.

1056
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's called cth.

1057
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
For example, we.

1058
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
We can write this.

1059
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And then it won't violate anything.

1060
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1061
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
There's no reason.

1062
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It doesn't exist.

1063
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So we can write it down.

1064
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

1065
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay.

1066
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Well, usually this term is.

1067
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We don't consider it because.

1068
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It can be written as a whole.

1069
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And in the whole.

1070
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Basically, it doesn't have any physical effect.

1071
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, maybe you're not familiar with it.

1072
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Then I'll mention it a little bit.

1073
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So when will this term have a physical effect?

1074
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That's if you have it today.

1075
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You have this.

1076
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Monopole background.

1077
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
If you have a monopole background today.

1078
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Plus this cth term.

1079
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You can find out that this monopole.

1080
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It also has a background.

1081
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Well, usually I put this kind of thing with a background.

1082
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's called Dayong.

1083
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

1084
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But we're talking about this today.

1085
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Or just call it monopole.

1086
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

1087
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So simply put.

1088
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
If you have this cth term today.

1089
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
If you have this monopole at the same time.

1090
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah, because I just said.

1091
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I just said.

1092
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
In this series.

1093
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
In this series.

1094
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
There's always going to be a monopole.

1095
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah.

1096
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So you have this cth term and monopole.

1097
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Then you calculate it.

1098
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You'll find that it should have a monopole at the same time.

1099
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Well, since there's a monopole.

1100
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's going to have a monopole.

1101
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
OK, so his monopole is in.

1102
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The shape of the red part in the lower right corner.

1103
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah.

1104
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So that you can get a feel for it.

1105
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm going to show you some calculations.

1106
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah, like this.

1107
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
For example, you just got out of this Lagrangian.

1108
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You can write down its equation motion.

1109
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's the one on the top left.

1110
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The one in the upper left corner.

1111
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The yellow equation.

1112
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And through our definition of this battery voltage.

1113
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's in the upper right corner.

1114
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Like what?

1115
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
FJ 0 equals EJ.

1116
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
This kind of thing.

1117
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
E is the power plant.

1118
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And then B is the power plant.

1119
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You can get that.

1120
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We're most familiar with the Maxwell equation.

1121
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Like that.

1122
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You know, the frequency.

1123
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The power plant.

1124
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
If it's usually 0.

1125
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, if it's usually 0.

1126
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
If there's no power consumption, it should be 0.

1127
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yeah.

1128
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So we can say this.

1129
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
This Maxwell equation.

1130
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So if you're today.

1131
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Through this Maxwell equation.

1132
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
If you have a multiple.

1133
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You can do the same thing.

1134
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Calculate this voltage.

1135
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Okay.

1136
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So if you're interested.

1137
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You can.

1138
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
After the lecture.

1139
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You can take a closer look at this.

1140
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's actually pretty simple.

1141
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
OK.

1142
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So you can just look at this theta H.

1143
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
This theta H is in this.

1144
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
In the micro-division.

1145
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
In this.

1146
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
In the delta dot.

1147
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So that means theta.

1148
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's basically.

1149
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It can also be a.

1150
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Space function.

1151
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah.

1152
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Because I'm going to extend it later.

1153
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's an action.

1154
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Action.

1155
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's a.

1156
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's a.

1157
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's a factory.

1158
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That factory.

1159
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's a space function.

1160
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That is to say.

1161
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
If you enter today.

1162
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's not just theta.

1163
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's a.

1164
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's an action.

1165
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Then this.

1166
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
This.

1167
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
What about the voltage?

1168
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's not going to be at the origin.

1169
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That.

1170
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
That origin.

1171
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's going to be in space.

1172
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Through this action.

1173
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It will.

1174
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It will be carried by this action field.

1175
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
OK.

1176
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Okay.

1177
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Is there any problem here?

1178
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Although it's a bit difficult.

1179
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes, I have a question.

1180
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So basically you.

1181
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Model will be coupled to dark photon.

1182
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But it's with.

1183
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's you.

1184
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The coupling of monopole and dark photon.

1185
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You have to argue now.

1186
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's like saying.

1187
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Its coupling is dependent on.

1188
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
One.

1189
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
A field that can change with space.

1190
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That's the theta.

1191
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And then.

1192
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You said that.

1193
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That theta.

1194
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You think.

1195
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's a field.

1196
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So you said it.

1197
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
OK.

1198
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's x.

1199
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Is that so?

1200
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
No.

1201
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That is.

1202
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You can repeat.

1203
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
For example, look at me.

1204
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm not writing a theta.

1205
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Like this.

1206
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I can change this theta.

1207
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's a time and space function.

1208
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You can.

1209
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1210
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So this thing is your x.

1211
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah.

1212
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah.

1213
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But.

1214
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That is to say.

1215
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You are now.

1216
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's basically you.

1217
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's his.

1218
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That.

1219
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That monopole charge.

1220
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So he basically.

1221
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You and.

1222
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Dark photon.

1223
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The coupling is.

1224
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Basically, I'll write it down.

1225
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's him.

1226
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Do you know what he looks like?

1227
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Or what?

1228
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Is that what you mean?

1229
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Undensity.

1230
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Um.

1231
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What did you say?

1232
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I didn't hear it.

1233
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Hello.

1234
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Hello.

1235
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Hello.

1236
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Um.

1237
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Did you hear that?

1238
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Did you hear that?

1239
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Hello.

1240
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I heard his voice.

1241
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Zhang Yong.

1242
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Zhang Yong is missing.

1243
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Why?

1244
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Did the others hear my voice?

1245
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Have.

1246
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Zhang Yong is missing.

1247
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
No.

1248
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Wait a minute.

1249
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
He is.

1250
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Is he online?

1251
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Have.

1252
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Have.

1253
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But no sound.

1254
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah.

1255
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Wait a minute.

1256
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't know what's going on.

1257
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I have.

1258
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm going to send him a message.

1259
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I pressed it, didn't I?

1260
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Wait a minute.

1261
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
He's gone.

1262
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So I should keep talking and wait for him.

1263
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You have to wait for him.

1264
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Have you seen my screen?

1265
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Have you seen my screen?

1266
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
No.

1267
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
No?

1268
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I just pressed share.

1269
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Have you seen my screen?

1270
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Have you seen my screen?

1271
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
He's gone.

1272
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
He's gone.

1273
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm still recording.

1274
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Then I'll continue.

1275
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Because...

1276
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah.

1277
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'll talk to him later.

1278
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah.

1279
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I have a question.

1280
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Is the charge

1281
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
the same as our EM charge?

1282
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
No.

1283
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's different.

1284
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's different.

1285
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So you're basically

1286
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
copying the EM wave again.

1287
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah, it's very simple.

1288
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's a very small coupling

1289
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
to our whole world.

1290
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It doesn't have to be big or small.

1291
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's all right.

1292
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But the main thing is that we can't

1293
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
get close to it.

1294
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah, basically...

1295
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'll talk about it later.

1296
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
In fact, the coupling is quite large.

1297
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That is to say...

1298
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I don't know if I'm using EH now.

1299
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm using the electron structure constant.

1300
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Like I just said, alpha H.

1301
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Like I'm in the back.

1302
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The numerical study is about

1303
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
close to 1.

1304
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But the general...

1305
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You know, the general electron

1306
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
effect electron structure constant

1307
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
is about

1308
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
10 to the power of 2

1309
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
divided by 137 or something.

1310
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

1311
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm back.

1312
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm sorry.

1313
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If you just answered

1314
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and I skipped it completely,

1315
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
it doesn't matter.

1316
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Just ignore me.

1317
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm sorry.

1318
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah.

1319
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
We can discuss it later.

1320
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
OK.

1321
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Let's continue.

1322
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Anyway, this is actually quite simple.

1323
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You can see the video later.

1324
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You can push it yourself.

1325
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
If I were a professor,

1326
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I would ask this question.

1327
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's really simple.

1328
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
OK.

1329
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This is my model here.

1330
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
This is Benchmark Point.

1331
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah.

1332
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
In fact, this model has already

1333
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
done some detailed research.

1334
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
But so far,

1335
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
no one has really considered

1336
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
how this multiple

1337
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and

1338
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
the numerical effect through action.

1339
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But we're...

1340
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
My boss is the first one

1341
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
to come up with this idea.

1342
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Then he asked me to do the calculation.

1343
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So you can see this on the picture.

1344
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
This picture is made by someone else.

1345
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah.

1346
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I put the credit in the upper right corner.

1347
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
For example,

1348
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
you can see this tangent axis on the picture.

1349
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
This is the size of the energy structure.

1350
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The horizontal axis is the size of the positive and negative expectant.

1351
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It corresponds to the value of this multiple.

1352
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yeah.

1353
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That's the red part.

1354
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That's the red part.

1355
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
We're going to consider this.

1356
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Consider the red part on the picture.

1357
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
The red part on the picture.

1358
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That is to say.

1359
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I forgot to say something.

1360
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
In this model,

1361
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
in addition to this multiple,

1362
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
you can do dark matter.

1363
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The one in the table.

1364
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
W.

1365
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
W positive can also do dark matter.

1366
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah.

1367
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Why is this model?

1368
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It considers

1369
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm 100%

1370
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
This dark matter is contributed by multiple.

1371
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah.

1372
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So consider maybe 10% or 35% like this.

1373
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Then we use its result directly.

1374
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
To do the analysis.

1375
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah.

1376
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But anyway, in principle,

1377
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
we can reproduce its results.

1378
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah.

1379
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But our paper here is mainly.

1380
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
As long as.

1381
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Estimate a number level.

1382
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah.

1383
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We use its result directly.

1384
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Okay.

1385
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Then we assume that this.

1386
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Dark matter is contributed by 35%.

1387
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Dark matter is.

1388
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
35% of it is contributed by this multiple.

1389
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Okay.

1390
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
In this case,

1391
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
the average is about 0.7.

1392
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Then this multiple is very heavy.

1393
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
About 200 TeV.

1394
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah.

1395
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That's for reference.

1396
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Like the one just now.

1397
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I asked before.

1398
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Is that.

1399
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The experiment of WIMP.

1400
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's going to be 10 to the power of 4.

1401
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So 10 to the power of 4.

1402
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's only about 10 TeV.

1403
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So it's probably still.

1404
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
This is still.

1405
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Ten times heavier than the average experiment.

1406
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Above.

1407
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It can even be heavier.

1408
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay.

1409
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Anyway.

1410
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Then I'm going to do it again.

1411
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Our work is very simple.

1412
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Is that we.

1413
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Consider the graph on the right.

1414
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
On the left.

1415
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
With this.

1416
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The idea is that M is multiple.

1417
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Then N is Neutron.

1418
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Then through the middle.

1419
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This action.

1420
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
No border.

1421
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That.

1422
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
This action and this Neutron.

1423
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The last one is.

1424
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's easier.

1425
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Just assume there's a.

1426
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yukai.

1427
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yukai interaction.

1428
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You know this theory.

1429
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Right.

1430
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yukai should be quite famous.

1431
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It's Japan.

1432
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's a theoretical science.

1433
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yeah.

1434
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah.

1435
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
What's more difficult is.

1436
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
How to calculate multiple.

1437
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
With this action.

1438
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This interaction.

1439
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
That's it.

1440
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's going to be.

1441
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The so-called winter effect.

1442
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That is to say.

1443
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You can imagine.

1444
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
This.

1445
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Uh.

1446
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
More.

1447
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
More.

1448
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Uh.

1449
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
How?

1450
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Because of that.

1451
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
His.

1452
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
If there is an action.

1453
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
This charge.

1454
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It will.

1455
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It will spread in space.

1456
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
In some sense.

1457
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It will.

1458
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It will affect this.

1459
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Uh.

1460
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Neutron.

1461
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
For example.

1462
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
If you have this.

1463
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
If this is moving.

1464
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
This.

1465
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Neutron.

1466
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
He might feel this.

1467
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
This.

1468
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
This movement.

1469
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah.

1470
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So.

1471
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Let's say they have an interaction.

1472
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yeah.

1473
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Through this action.

1474
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
That's pretty hard.

1475
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Because of this.

1476
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
We can't just write this.

1477
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This action.

1478
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
With mobile.

1479
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
This interaction.

1480
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's going to be through this.

1481
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Winter effect.

1482
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

1483
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's it.

1484
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Some of my boss's ideas.

1485
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

1486
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
That.

1487
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
If we can calculate this.

1488
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
These interactions.

1489
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
What about it?

1490
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
We can also calculate this process.

1491
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
This color scheme.

1492
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Because you remember.

1493
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We were just in time.

1494
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
You have to compare with the experiment.

1495
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That time.

1496
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They measured the color scheme.

1497
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
With.

1498
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
The same relationship.

1499
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah.

1500
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
As long as we calculate it.

1501
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You can do it.

1502
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Compare with time.

1503
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And then to our model.

1504
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Some parameters.

1505
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Constraint.

1506
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Good.

1507
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Well, since we're actually.

1508
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
We also consider some other experiments.

1509
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Like the so-called experience.

1510
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah.

1511
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And these.

1512
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
This experiment is mainly to measure some.

1513
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
More long life.

1514
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
This.

1515
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Some particles.

1516
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah.

1517
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
That action.

1518
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's one of the possibilities.

1519
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah.

1520
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
We also put this.

1521
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
This time limit.

1522
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Also put it in this.

1523
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah.

1524
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Analysis.

1525
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah.

1526
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Okay.

1527
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
There's a lot of time in this regard.

1528
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Like this.

1529
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
On the left.

1530
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
See this charm on the picture.

1531
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And ship.

1532
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah.

1533
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And charm is already given.

1534
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Some upper bound.

1535
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah.

1536
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Some restrictions.

1537
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And ship is.

1538
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Future perspective.

1539
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That's it.

1540
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
There's also this FA on the picture.

1541
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
FA is basically.

1542
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
This.

1543
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The intensity of the interaction.

1544
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That is to say.

1545
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
If you F is super big.

1546
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But this strength is weaker.

1547
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah.

1548
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah.

1549
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We can also see this FA.

1550
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That's this.

1551
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The strength of this action.

1552
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Probably.

1553
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It's related to this FA.

1554
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You'll see it later.

1555
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Okay.

1556
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Since this is the mother.

1557
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'll bring it over soon.

1558
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Because this is too detailed.

1559
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'll tell you the story.

1560
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
The way to finish my theoretical computing work.

1561
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's the same.

1562
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
We have this model.

1563
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Write down this Lagrangian.

1564
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And then the last one.

1565
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
What about this?

1566
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's a constant.

1567
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Now, I'm going to do this.

1568
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Let's do it.

1569
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Promoted to a.

1570
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
This one.

1571
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's a dynamical.

1572
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The field.

1573
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Like this.

1574
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
That's our action.

1575
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
That's the action here.

1576
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But I'm normal.

1577
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
By this FA.

1578
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That is to say.

1579
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
What about this?

1580
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's not a unit.

1581
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah.

1582
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That.

1583
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Once we write down this Lagrangian.

1584
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We can solve it.

1585
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
To solve this.

1586
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Motion equation.

1587
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That's the equation of motion.

1588
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's the picture.

1589
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That's the picture.

1590
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
This line below.

1591
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
A little complicated.

1592
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And then we'll put in some boundary conditions.

1593
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That is to say.

1594
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
We have to assume that this.

1595
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
The energy of the system is limited.

1596
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It can't be infinite.

1597
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's not going to happen.

1598
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So this action field is at the origin.

1599
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
To go to zero.

1600
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And then at the same time.

1601
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's infinite.

1602
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It's going to be.

1603
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Close to this.

1604
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
A constant.

1605
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
This constant is called Zeta 0.

1606
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
With this equation of motion and boundary conditions.

1607
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
We can solve.

1608
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Equation of motion.

1609
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Whether it's using numbers or some.

1610
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Uh, just solve it.

1611
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
The picture is.

1612
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
The picture is our result.

1613
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That green.

1614
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
That's what.

1615
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
The orange one is the result of our numbers.

1616
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Uh, that's what we're going to do.

1617
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Solve the original equation directly.

1618
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Of course, we have some mirroring.

1619
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The blue curve is the result of the number.

1620
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Then I found out that we.

1621
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
The solution of the solution is very good.

1622
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah, I didn't say that.

1623
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Because it's a little complicated.

1624
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Okay, so.

1625
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So you can see this action.

1626
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
This, this, this distribution.

1627
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That's the picture.

1628
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's the distance from the distance.

1629
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So the closer.

1630
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The closer to the left is the position of the model.

1631
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That's the zero part.

1632
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And then go.

1633
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
To the right is.

1634
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, long distance.

1635
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So you can see when it's closer and closer.

1636
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This is this.

1637
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Well, it's not, it's not mobile.

1638
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's the actual fuel.

1639
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
The ratio of his one is getting smaller.

1640
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, that's kind of a simple reason.

1641
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Because I just saw.

1642
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
This shop will.

1643
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
The power plant will do this.

1644
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The value of this github has to do with.

1645
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So if you're getting closer and closer.

1646
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
If you're far away, you're getting smaller and smaller.

1647
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
You're going to send it.

1648
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Then you're going to blow up your system.

1649
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So it becomes that when you're getting closer and closer.

1650
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
What about this city tower?

1651
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's going to be close to zero.

1652
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That's how the system is going to be.

1653
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah, that's the most basic reason.

1654
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So you can predict that he's somewhere.

1655
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
This action, his size, he's somewhere.

1656
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
To reduce.

1657
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah, that's the reduction.

1658
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
The location is probably.

1659
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Roughly in this part.

1660
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
That's probably.

1661
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
That's the one on the video.

1662
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
The following definition.

1663
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Well, you don't really need to know this definition.

1664
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Why is that?

1665
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
And then.

1666
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So we're basically going to end this.

1667
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
The distribution of the action field near this model.

1668
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So we're going to take it as a three-dimensional interface.

1669
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
That's the first one on the screen.

1670
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That's what I just said.

1671
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The action, yes.

1672
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
For example, look at this one.

1673
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
This is a x, a of x, which is action.

1674
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And then what's behind that?

1675
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That's the new curve.

1676
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
This is a general way of doing long-term computing.

1677
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This is a familiar way of writing.

1678
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Yeah.

1679
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
What about this?

1680
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Or what about the light?

1681
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
We can go and calculate the probability of its color.

1682
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
The color of this mp2.

1683
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Okay, so it's the shape.

1684
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Uh, his.

1685
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
The result is the second line of the equation.

1686
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And then you can see that there's one in this equation.

1687
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
There's a space for this x.

1688
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
This kind of point.

1689
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That is to say, if we just.

1690
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
We just got rid of his.

1691
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
This space is distributed.

1692
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So it's natural to throw it into this point.

1693
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And then you can calculate this mp2.

1694
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And then you make the mp2 a square.

1695
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You can calculate this.

1696
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The three-color interface.

1697
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And then the result is.

1698
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The green part below, like this.

1699
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So this is the final, final, final, final theoretical calculation.

1700
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
This is the result.

1701
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But after this result.

1702
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I have a question.

1703
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Okay.

1704
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
My, my, my, my, actually, my question is quite general.

1705
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
That is.

1706
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Ok, so you, now your monopuly charge.

1707
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And then we actually know.

1708
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Hello, the density seems to be how much.

1709
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So you can probably know.

1710
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's your number density.

1711
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
This bridge hundreds of TV.

1712
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Number density.

1713
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
How much is it?

1714
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But they're all charging each other.

1715
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So.

1716
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So they can interact with each other through dark four times.

1717
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Or the repair is, you know, which is why you put together.

1718
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So you're not going to have a very strong constraint.

1719
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Is it from?

1720
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I put it in.

1721
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I'll give you a look at this.

1722
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
In fact, the company has considered this.

1723
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Yeah, they're going to steal a black photon.

1724
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It's going to form, it's going to form.

1725
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
What do you mean?

1726
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It's going to have a strong effect.

1727
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It's going to have a very strong effect.

1728
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Of course, we have that.

1729
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's okay.

1730
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah, okay, interesting.

1731
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Okay, thank you.

1732
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
No, I didn't say too much.

1733
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So there is.

1734
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Good.

1735
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Anyway, it's very mathematical here.

1736
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's it.

1737
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That's it.

1738
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I just finished talking about it.

1739
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's just more technical stuff.

1740
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Okay, so we're going to figure out the result.

1741
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It's a three-color interface.

1742
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I just said that time is to look at the relationship between the three-color interface and the value.

1743
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Okay, so that's the result.

1744
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And I'm going to give you two examples here.

1745
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm going to pick two.

1746
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Okay, that's basically what I just did.

1747
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I just don't have that.

1748
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
This one.

1749
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah, this one.

1750
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
His signature is F.A.

1751
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And then the horizontal axis is X.

1752
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
That's the same.

1753
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You can look at this green one.

1754
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Do you happen to have these parameters?

1755
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Well, basically, there's no parameter that needs to be adjusted.

1756
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
For example.

1757
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Uh.

1758
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Alpha H.

1759
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
We've just been given the benchmark point.

1760
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And then M.N. is the value of the box.

1761
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
We know that the box is about 1G.

1762
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And then C.T.A.0 is a parameter.

1763
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And then C.T.A.

1764
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
C.T.A.N.

1765
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
C.N. is probably some theoretical data.

1766
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Calculate it like this.

1767
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So we don't have a lot of parameters.

1768
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
In this model.

1769
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Okay.

1770
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And then we can see the result.

1771
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So we're the same.

1772
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The horizontal axis is F.A.

1773
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And then the horizontal axis is X.

1774
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And then we pick two benchmark points.

1775
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And then the red and green on the graph.

1776
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
There's already a time limit.

1777
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So I'm going to use the first one.

1778
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm going to use the first one.

1779
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And then the blue one is going to be in the future.

1780
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It's Pico 500.

1781
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's the same.

1782
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It's the same.

1783
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's the time of a dark matter.

1784
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It's going to be measured in the future.

1785
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That's it.

1786
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So you can see that this is about the size of F.A.

1787
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It's about 10 to the 7th square.

1788
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
That's it.

1789
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Okay, so it's almost time.

1790
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's about to upgrade.

1791
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Just a little bit about this.

1792
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's pretty simple.

1793
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's just preparing a pro.

1794
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Uh, a pro.

1795
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Or some experiments are done with Electron.

1796
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And then he's using Proton.

1797
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And then he's going to turn a target.

1798
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And then there's some reaction in this target.

1799
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And then there's a lot of these.

1800
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Some of these rings.

1801
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And then these rings might be able to get to a lot of.

1802
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I don't know about these unknown particles.

1803
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Maybe it's the action.

1804
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
That's the action.

1805
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
He might not be stable.

1806
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
He might be in.

1807
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
He's changed before he got to the tag.

1808
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Or to say.

1809
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's changing after you leave.

1810
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah, well, there's a possibility that he's changing inside the tag.

1811
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And then it might change into light.

1812
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Ah, electricity.

1813
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Ah, aim.

1814
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Then, of course, we're on the model side.

1815
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
This light will change to Hilton Photon.

1816
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yeah, that's the one down there.

1817
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Equation is this.

1818
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We should have to predict how many events we should see.

1819
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yeah.

1820
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That's the only thing I'm going to change.

1821
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's very simple to say.

1822
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Of course, it's a test.

1823
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
You can see the particle.

1824
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's like light, aim, or electricity.

1825
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Hidden Photon is invisible.

1826
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
But because there's a hidden.

1827
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because it's a hidden Photon.

1828
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So it's going to reduce.

1829
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Action to the probability of visible particles.

1830
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Yeah, so it's going to be.

1831
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Uh, it's going to be diluted.

1832
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So it's going to be a little bit weaker.

1833
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And then it's like, uh.

1834
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm going to show you this.

1835
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Like the one on the left.

1836
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You'll find that.

1837
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That Alpha H is zero.

1838
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Alpha H means there's no Hilton Photon.

1839
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It's just.

1840
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It's none of my business.

1841
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Constraint.

1842
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's black.

1843
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
The black part.

1844
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But if you have an introduction of Hilton Photon.

1845
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Then you'll find that this.

1846
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Constraint will be.

1847
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It's going to be weak.

1848
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's going to shrink.

1849
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's going to shrink.

1850
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Because there's a new channel.

1851
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah, that's Trump.

1852
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And then the left and right is the future.

1853
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah, we're the same.

1854
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Consider some of the same.

1855
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Uh, the possibility of Alpha H.

1856
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
So we just had the result of the bin.

1857
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And then we have this.

1858
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Uh, the result of the direct observation.

1859
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And the result of the bin.

1860
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So we can simply combine them together.

1861
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Okay, so this is our final result.

1862
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Of course, it's a little complicated.

1863
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But let's take a look at the picture.

1864
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Back.

1865
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
That's what the color counter is.

1866
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That's what the back color.

1867
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Shadow part is.

1868
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It's been excluded so far.

1869
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That's the only white part.

1870
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It's still allowed at the moment.

1871
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
That's about about ten to the fourth.

1872
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Uh, ten to the fifth.

1873
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And it's about ten mv.

1874
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's just around here.

1875
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
This is the pin.

1876
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
With this.

1877
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
With this, uh, direct measurement.

1878
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
There's an overlap.

1879
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Well, of course, we can say that in the future.

1880
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Maybe in this range.

1881
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
To detect this model.

1882
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's still value like this.

1883
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Okay, so this is our final result.

1884
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Okay, so I'm going to summarize it.

1885
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Uh, our research project is simply to study.

1886
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Uh, hidden motor.

1887
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Hidden motor and.

1888
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
The nuclear, uh, through this action.

1889
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Uh, interaction.

1890
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And then we're going to calculate its three-color interface.

1891
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And then compare it with the experiment.

1892
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And then I found about two.

1893
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Two parameters space, it may be in the future.

1894
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
This dark matter experiment and this ice cream experiment.

1895
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Uh, do the test.

1896
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Okay, so this is my speech today.

1897
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Thank you all.

1898
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Okay, so now I'd like to ask you to turn on the microphone.

1899
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So that we can hear our applause.

1900
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So let's give it up.

1901
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

1902
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Um, okay.

1903
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1904
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Uh, I have a question.

1905
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
How do you decide this?

1906
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Uh, your input parameters.

1907
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Like, uh, and, uh, and, uh.

1908
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Oh, okay.

1909
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Okay.

1910
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
It's just that.

1911
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
For example, this side.

1912
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Oh, my God.

1913
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
This is.

1914
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
This one, this one.

1915
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Why is it?

1916
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That is, we can.

1917
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I just said we can estimate.

1918
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
This dark matter.

1919
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Uh, this number density.

1920
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Right?

1921
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That's what I just said on the side of the photo.

1922
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
A little bit.

1923
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Theoretical work.

1924
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Theoretically, we can estimate the number density of the dark matter.

1925
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And then we know it again.

1926
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Can we know its quality?

1927
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
This is mn.

1928
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
This is your mn times.

1929
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Your value times number density is.

1930
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Mass density.

1931
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That mass density will tell you.

1932
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
How much of this dark matter should be in the universe?

1933
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
This one.

1934
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
How many potions?

1935
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Well, I just said at the beginning.

1936
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Dark matter.

1937
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
He should be in the universe.

1938
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Uh.

1939
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
One quarter of it.

1940
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
So it becomes you.

1941
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
You have a very strong limit.

1942
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So it's called fit.

1943
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
That one.

1944
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
This 25% of the words.

1945
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Your number.

1946
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Your alpha h and mn.

1947
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Can be fixed.

1948
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
But the result of theory.

1949
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I see.

1950
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So in this model.

1951
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Exxon is not dark matter.

1952
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
He is not.

1953
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But I know.

1954
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I know.

1955
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You also know that many people use.

1956
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Exxon is dark matter.

1957
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
That side.

1958
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
We mainly treat Exxon as a medium.

1959
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
He will treat it as dark matter.

1960
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It can also be.

1961
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
But his contribution should be very small.

1962
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It's almost negligible.

1963
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Compared to this.

1964
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Actually, I have one.

1965
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I have a similar.

1966
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
The problem is.

1967
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So, okay.

1968
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So your halo is basically.

1969
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Or whatever.

1970
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Anyway, your.

1971
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
That one.

1972
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Dark matter is monopole.

1973
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But he will still.

1974
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Couple Exxon.

1975
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
That.

1976
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
If today.

1977
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Really in.

1978
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
For example, that kind of.

1979
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
He has a very strong magnetic field.

1980
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Then he can.

1981
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's like putting that.

1982
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Vacuum.

1983
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Exxon.

1984
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Is playing out.

1985
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
A photon can resonate.

1986
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But such an effect.

1987
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Can it happen to you?

1988
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
This model.

1989
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Just those side.

1990
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Exxon.

1991
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
That you.

1992
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Here, because I'm here.

1993
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I'm actually not relying on the photon.

1994
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It's not a general photon.

1995
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It should.

1996
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It should be said that there is a couple.

1997
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
But it should be.

1998
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Wait a minute.

1999
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Strength.

2000
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You see.

2001
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Through the general action.

2002
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
With the photon.

2003
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That.

2004
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That.

2005
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
That.

2006
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And then through that.

2007
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
That.

2008
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
That.

2009
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That.

2010
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
That.

2011
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
That.

2012
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
That.

2013
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,820
That's a very strong electrical field.

2014
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,820
Then to generate exxon is not.

2015
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,820
To be honest.

2016
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,820
Yes, it is.

2017
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,820
It's through a loop.

2018
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:56,960
Then it becomes.

2019
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,880
If you give him a photon.

2020
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,880
Then it is.

2021
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,880
Then you it through a loop.

2022
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,880
Then it becomes a.

2023
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,380
Uh, what is this.

2024
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,380
It's a normal photon.

2025
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,380
It's not a dark photon.

2026
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,380
Yes, that's what it is.

2027
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,380
I want to.

2028
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,380
I want to have constraint.

2029
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,380
But because of my action is.

2030
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,380
It should be very.

2031
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,380
You see, I'm actually quite heavy.

2032
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,380
Your impression.

2033
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,380
I see.

2034
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,380
So, if you do.

2035
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,380
So, because I'm actually quite heavy.

2036
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,380
So, if you do.

2037
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,760
Without using.

2038
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,760
Oh, so you came out.

2039
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,760
It's not even.

2040
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,760
You come out.

2041
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,760
It's a super.

2042
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,760
That doesn't mean.

2043
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2044
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,760
I see I see.

2045
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,240
OK.

2046
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,240
Then everyone has a question?

2047
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,240
Why don't you consider others?

2048
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,240
Why didn't you consider others?

2049
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,240
direct.

2050
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,240
That.

2051
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,240
This article is a.

2052
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,240
Recreational learning field.

2053
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,240
After the Selena Gavin memo like this.

2054
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,240
Why don't you consider others?

2055
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,240
direct.

2056
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,240
Uh, that Darkmatt'lll also have time to say.

2057
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,240
Can, can I.

2058
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,240
Everyone, see you like me.

2059
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,240
It's says I have this mother to.

2060
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,080
It's said that this fact is then.

2061
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,080
It's fixed.

2062
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,980
Spin dependent right.

2063
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,080
This is the first one.

2064
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,080
Then there is.

2065
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,080
We, we, of course, pick.

2066
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,080
We, of course, pick this concentrate.

2067
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,080
The strongest is probably.

2068
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,080
I'm probably here.

2069
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,080
I'm kidding.

2070
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,080
Why spin dependent?

2071
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,080
This, I'm a little bit missed.

2072
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,080
Uh, actually, I didn't explain it.

2073
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,080
But.

2074
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,080
Let's put it this way.

2075
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,080
This is more technical.

2076
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,080
That is to say.

2077
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,080
You see this equation.

2078
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,080
This is the result.

2079
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,080
If you're more familiar.

2080
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,080
If you're more familiar with theory, you'll find out.

2081
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
You find this section.

2082
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,080
It's a bit of this.

2083
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,080
Transfer momentum.

2084
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,080
So, if you're more familiar with the theory.

2085
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,080
You'll find that this section.

2086
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,080
It's a bit of this.

2087
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,080
It's a bit of this.

2088
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,080
Transfer momentum.

2089
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,180
Transfer momentum.

2090
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,180
What did he say?

2091
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,180
So, anyway.

2092
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:53,380


2093
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,380
This momentum dependence.

2094
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,380
Connection is generally spin level.

2095
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,380
Yes, we have to consider this from the side.

2096
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,180
So, so what you mean is.

2097
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,180
Anyway, in general.

2098
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,180
The result you calculated depends on spin level.

2099
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,280
This is not an assumption or something you can decide first.

2100
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,280
Is that right?

2101
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,280
It should be said that we have this result.

2102
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,280
We can.

2103
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,280
Obviously, this result tells you.

2104
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,280
It depends on this transfer momentum.

2105
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,280
So it depends on spin.

2106
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,280
Then we can find some.

2107
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,280
Effect operator.

2108
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,280
They.

2109
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,280
The result they calculated is also spin dependent.

2110
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,280
Then at the same time it depends on this transfer momentum.

2111
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,280
Then we use its result to confirm this parameter.

2112
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:40,380
But it doesn't mean that the transfer momentum has spin or something.

2113
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,380
If it is spin independent.

2114
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,380
You can also set some constraints, right?

2115
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,380
You don't have to have spin.

2116
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,380
Because.

2117
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,380
Because it depends on momentum.

2118
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,380
So.

2119
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,380
Generally, spin independent seems.

2120
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,380
It should be weaker.

2121
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,380
You just said it's the next level.

2122
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,380
This is a bit like.

2123
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,380
This independent should have a leading order.

2124
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,380
Is.

2125
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,380
What is it?

2126
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,380
Leading order and sub-leading order.

2127
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,380
This kind of spin dependent should have very little contribution.

2128
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,380
It's kind of S-wave, P-wave.

2129
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,380
Very similar feeling.

2130
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,480
In fact, I have a slide.

2131
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,480
I talked about it in Dongda before.

2132
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,480
I don't want to talk about this detail.

2133
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,480
Let me see.

2134
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,480
I talked about it in Dongda.

2135
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,480
You can take a look.

2136
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,480
Of course, there was more detail at that time.

2137
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,480
For example, we have to consider this.

2138
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
This effect operator.

2139
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Then obviously you see this effect.

2140
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,480
Starting from this effect operator.

2141
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,580
Now, for example, on this screen.

2142
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,580
This Psi is the document.

2143
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,580
Then Psi n is the new curve.

2144
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,580
Then through this effect operator.

2145
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:09,580
We can calculate its amplitude.

2146
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,580
Then you can see that the amplitude depends on this.

2147
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,580
This spin.

2148
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,580
For example, that sigma is polymetric.

2149
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,580
For example, this kind of thing is.

2150
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,580
Spin dependent.

2151
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,580
Then there is the same amplitude.

2152
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,580
You can calculate its cross-section.

2153
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,580
Then someone has already done this analysis.

2154
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,580
So basically, I just put this equation.

2155
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,580
For example, this yellow one.

2156
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,680
The final result.

2157
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,680
Then equal to the result we just calculated.

2158
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,680
Then do the comparison like this.

2159
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,680
So to be honest, we are a bit like.

2160
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,680
Use other constraints to constrain our parameters.

2161
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,680
We did not directly.

2162
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,680
For example, you may want to do some.

2163
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,680
More complicated calculations.

2164
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,680
Because we haven't scored this cross-section yet.

2165
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,680
We still have to consider some.

2166
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,680
Neutron.

2167
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,680
Recurrence.

2168
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,780
Recurrence.

2169
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,780
But I didn't really do a deep analysis.

2170
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,780
We just put people's results.

2171
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,780
To constrain.

2172
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,780
This is someone else's upper bound.

2173
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,780
We can just extract it.

2174
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,780
I will ask this question because.

2175
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,780
Axiom interaction is not limited to.

2176
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,780
Spin dependent cross-section.

2177
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,780
You can go straight to many experiments.

2178
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,780
Measure the axiom.

2179
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,780
Axiom can be absorbed.

2180
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,880
So if you just look at.

2181
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,880
The Fermi diagram.

2182
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,880
You can consider.

2183
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,880
Axiom is absorbed by your detector.

2184
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,880
So you can use xenon.

2185
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,880
Or LZ to measure.

2186
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,880
That's right.

2187
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,880
Are you measuring the axiom now?

2188
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,880
Because you have to go through the axiom.

2189
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,880
To measure your monopole.

2190
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,980
Right?

2191
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,980
Because it is a medium.

2192
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,980
So.

2193
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,980
So you go to your Fermi diagram.

2194
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,980
Your left side of the Fermi diagram.

2195
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,980
Monopole and axiom coupling.

2196
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,980
Your right side is the axiom.

2197
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,980
Coupling with Fibre.

2198
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,980
Any coupling between the axiom and your detector.

2199
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,980
So basically I think.

2200
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,980
You should also have.

2201
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,980
You can use other bigger detectors to measure.

2202
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,980
Because they have already done.

2203
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:27,980
A lot of axiom measurements.

2204
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,980
But I don't know about the mass range.

2205
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,980
Except for Bindan.

2206
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,980
If you have this theory.

2207
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,980
Other experiments can also do.

2208
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,980
High energy axiom measurements.

2209
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,980
They just don't have a good theory.

2210
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,980
The reason is because the axiom is so high.

2211
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,980
This high mass region.

2212
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,980
His lifetime is very short.

2213
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,080
So it can't be a dark matter.

2214
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,080
Right.

2215
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,080
So these direct dark matter experiments.

2216
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,080
They won't consider.

2217
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,080
This kind of axiom.

2218
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,080
He will only consider KEV's axiom.

2219
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,080
He won't consider.

2220
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,080
GEV or NEV's axiom.

2221
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,080
But if you set up this model.

2222
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
They can consider GEV's axiom.

2223
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,080
Because your axiom is not dark matter.

2224
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,080
It's your monopole that's dark matter.

2225
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,180
Yeah.

2226
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,180
But I don't know what you just said.

2227
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,180
Experiment.

2228
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,180
LZ can be.

2229
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:26,180
Unlox or Xenon.

2230
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,180
They all have a lot of.

2231
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,180
Bosonic dark matter measurement.

2232
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,180
Basically.

2233
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,180
Axiom in KEV to 100 KEV.

2234
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,180
This range.

2235
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,180
You can imagine the axiom.

2236
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,180
Detected absorbed.

2237
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,180
Just like the photon.

2238
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,180
Then you can use this.

2239
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,280
Then you can use this to consider the axiom.

2240
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,280
That.

2241
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,280
In the KEV range.

2242
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,280
What about your model?

2243
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,280
Basically, you can also consider the axiom.

2244
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,280
NEV or GEV range.

2245
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,280
It was absorbed by your detector.

2246
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,280
Uh-huh.

2247
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,280
Of course they may.

2248
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,280
Their detector may have energy.

2249
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,280
Threshold may not be able to GEV.

2250
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,280
Maybe a few NEV.

2251
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,280
I guess.

2252
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,280
So maybe in this.

2253
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,380
Maybe on the left side of your picture.

2254
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,380
This place can be set up.

2255
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,380
Uplimit.

2256
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,380
Are you on the left side of the picture?

2257
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,380
There are many NEV parts.

2258
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,380
This is about 10 NEV range.

2259
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,380
But there are other things here.

2260
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,380
I didn't just say that.

2261
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,380
Yes, there may be other things.

2262
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,380
So I don't know.

2263
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,380
Is it other.

2264
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,380
These large dark matter experiments.

2265
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,380
Can also be done.

2266
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,480
What about the region on the left side of your picture?

2267
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,480
Because I don't know.

2268
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,480
Where is their energy threshold?

2269
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,480
I am doing low mass.

2270
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,480
But.

2271
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,480
But I look at this picture.

2272
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,480
I think it's actually a bit like.

2273
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,480
High mass experiment.

2274
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
Want to do low mass.

2275
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,480
The place is probably on the right.

2276
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,480
They can do a few GEV now.

2277
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,480
Then do a low mass.

2278
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,480
Just do it.

2279
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,480
So in fact, I think this one.

2280
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,580
A lot of people want to.

2281
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,580
There are a lot of direct experiments.

2282
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,580
You are not the same.

2283
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,580
This is Exxon, not WIMP.

2284
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,580
WIMP in GEV is low mass.

2285
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,580
But in Exxon, GEV is high mass.

2286
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,580
No, I'm talking about it now.

2287
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,580
In general, if you can.

2288
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,580
For example, you can couple to a.

2289
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:30,580
U1 Bosonic dark matter.

2290
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,580
So it actually includes this side.

2291
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,580
So I think it can.

2292
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,580
For example, if today.

2293
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,680
They consider.

2294
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,680
You can be in Xenon.

2295
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,680
For example.

2296
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,680
Analyzation signal.

2297
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,680
Direct absorption.

2298
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,680
They should be able to do 0.

2299
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,680
It's 10 to 0 to 10 to 1.

2300
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,680
If today is.

2301
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,680
If it's a solid detector.

2302
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,680
I think I can do it again.

2303
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,680
So in fact, this picture is a big piece.

2304
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,680
There should be data to look at.

2305
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,680
So it's possible to see.

2306
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,680
So you might have new concerns here.

2307
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,780
If you consider those.

2308
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,780
Giant dark matter experiment.

2309
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,780
I'll take a look.

2310
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,780
Tell me about it later.

2311
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:20,780
I'm actually doing a little analysis here.

2312
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,780
Because we're doing Marana now.

2313
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,780
We're thinking about whether we can do this.

2314
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:28,780
NEV Exxon experiment.

2315
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,780
Measurement.

2316
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,880
Because in general.

2317
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
Exxon in NEV.

2318
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,880
Lifetime is very short.

2319
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,880
So Exxon can't be dark matter.

2320
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,880
But if you are.

2321
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,880
There is a dark sector.

2322
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
Or a forever thing.

2323
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,880
Through Exxon couple to your detector.

2324
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
Then you.

2325
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,880
Exxon's lifetime can be very short.

2326
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,880
So in theory, you can set a constraint there.

2327
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,980
That's it.

2328
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,980
Sorry.

2329
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,980
Do you have any other questions?

2330
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,980
I think we.

2331
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,980
If you want to discuss it later.

2332
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,980
But do you have any other questions?

2333
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,980
If not.

2334
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,980
Let's applaud again.

2335
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,980
Thank you.

2336
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,980
Thank you all.

2337
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,980
That's it for today.

2338
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,080
That's it for today.

2339
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,080
That's it for today.
