0	9000	Hello, everyone. I'm the host of Taira, Hong Shih-an.
9000	18000	We're honored to invite Hong Wei to give a speech.
18000	26000	Hong Wei is now at North Carolina University.
26000	31000	He graduated from the Department of Chemistry at the National University of Transportation.
31000	35000	He entered North Carolina University in 2015.
35000	41000	He is mainly engaged in the study of light chemistry, energy materials, and nanoparticles.
41000	48000	He is interested in scientific writing and serves the science communication group in and out of the university.
49000	56000	The topic of his speech today is Near Field Optical Spectroscopy.
56000	61000	This is a very popular topic recently.
61000	64000	Let's invite him to give a speech.
64000	71000	Now you can turn on the microphone and give our speaker a round of applause.
71000	73000	Remember to turn on the microphone.
73000	75000	Let's start.
79000	83000	Thank you, everyone.
83000	86000	Thank you, Jason and Project Taira for giving me this opportunity.
86000	91000	Today, I would like to share the Near Field Optical Spectroscopy.
91000	96000	Sometimes, we also call it NAMI optical nanospectroscopy.
96000	104000	Today, I would like to introduce to you why we do this technology and how it is done.
104000	112000	NAMI optical nanospectroscopy is an application of NAMI 경찰institute for light.
112000	117000	For NAMI optical nanospectral?
118000	125000	We consider ourselves NAMI optical nanosceptical
125000	135000	We are located at the University of North Carolina,
135000	140000	at the campus of the church.
140000	145000	Our lab focuses on the development of NAMI optical nanospectral.
145000	150000	This is our program host, Dr. Joanna Atkin.
150000	160000	NAMI optical nanospectral is a heterogeneity.
160000	165000	The concept is like a chocolate wall.
165000	170000	If you look far away, you may only see a piece of green.
170000	175000	But if you look closely, you will find that it is a round chocolate wall.
175000	180000	And if you look closer, you may find that each shape is different.
180000	185000	Even the angle of each array is different.
185000	190000	This heterogeneity is often used in research materials.
190000	195000	We define it as a mesoscale structure.
195000	200000	This is the structure of the mesoscale structure.
200000	205000	This is the structure of the mesoscale structure.
205000	210000	The distribution is about nanometer to micrometer length scales.
210000	215000	Sometimes we deliberately introduce these heterogeneous structures for specific needs.
215000	220000	But sometimes it is inevitable.
220000	225000	When you generate molecules or materials, there will be heterogeneous structures.
225000	230000	This is a sample of a semiconductor with a molecule.
230000	235000	This is a sample of a semiconductor with a molecule.
235000	240000	This molecule generates two heterogeneous structures.
240000	245000	This molecule is a very chaotic structure.
245000	250000	This molecule is a very chaotic structure.
250000	255000	And the generation preference of the accelerator called hydrogen acetate is not available.
