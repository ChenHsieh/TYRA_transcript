0	7000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Chair Talk.
7000	10000	Our speaker today is Shuyu He.
10000	16000	Shuyu is now doing theoretical physics at Tohoku University in Tokyo, Japan.
16000	21000	He specializes in the theory of dark matter.
21000	25000	Shuyu He is actually a long-time friend of mine.
25000	28000	I'm sorry, I'm today's host, Zhang Yanyou.
28000	32000	Shuyu He majored in physics.
32000	37000	After graduating from physics, he went to Taiwan University to do his master's degree in dark matter.
37000	39000	He followed up with Mr. He Xiaoguang.
39000	44000	Then he came to Caltech and met me.
44000	47000	Now he's doing his PhD at Tohoku.
47000	52000	I don't know if I'm saying this correctly, but he should be graduating soon, right?
52000	54000	Next year, in September.
54000	57000	Yes, he's graduating soon.
57000	60000	The topic he's going to talk to us about today is
60000	66000	Hidden Monopole Dark Matter via XCO Portal and its Implications for Direct Search and Bind-Up Experiments.
66000	70000	This paper is actually already published in the archive.
70000	74000	If you look at the first page of the video, you can see the archive number.
74000	79000	Oh, by the way, when you clap, you have to turn on the microphone.
79000	81000	Only then can we hear you clap.
81000	89000	Let's give a round of applause to welcome Shuyu He to give us a wonderful speech today.
89000	93000	Thank you, Zhang Yanyou, for introducing me.
93000	97000	As you can see, the title of my speech is quite long.
97000	100000	Let me talk about a few key points first.
100000	106000	My speech today will focus on dark matter.
106000	108000	Dark Matter is the Chinese translation of dark matter.
108000	116000	I think if you don't usually do theoretical work, you should hear this term a lot.
116000	124000	Maybe through some of Taiwan's programs, you may hear the term dark matter.
124000	128000	Then you can see this hidden monopole in front of you.
128000	130000	Monopole is the Chinese translation of the word monopole.
130000	137000	If you have studied electronics, you will know that when we discuss electronics, we do not have a monopole.
137000	141000	Hidden, I will explain what it means.
141000	143000	Then there is action.
143000	146000	In my last speech, I basically made a long introduction.
146000	152000	But today, because of time, I should mainly focus on the introduction of dark matter.
152000	154000	So action, I might first mention it a little bit.
155000	159000	Then I will talk about the details of our model.
159000	163000	It is also applied in DirectSearch.
163000	167000	That is, directly detect the experiment of dark matter and the so-called Bindang Experiments.
167000	170000	I will mention these details at the end.
170000	174000	Let's go straight to the introduction of dark matter.
174000	180000	What you see on the screen now is our so-called example physical standard model.
180000	182000	Generally called Standard Model.
182000	187000	This model has been verified by a large number of experiments.
187000	189000	It is a very accurate theory.
189000	194000	Simply put, you can look at this picture.
194000	197000	Look at this E, this E is the so-called Electron.
197000	199000	This is the basic example that everyone is familiar with.
199000	203000	The focus is on Mu and Tau.
203000	207000	These examples are actually easy to find in the universe.
208000	213000	Then there is the so-called Mu, E, Mu, Mu and Mu, Tau is the so-called neutral value.
213000	217000	This is generally more unfamiliar.
217000	219000	But I won't touch this part in today's speech.
219000	223000	You can see that the red part above is the so-called Quarks.
223000	226000	Like this straight neutral value that everyone is more familiar with.
226000	229000	Basically they are not basic examples.
229000	231000	They are composed of these Quarks.
231000	238000	For example, this Proton is composed of two Up Quarks and one Down Quark.
238000	240000	That is the U and D on the graph.
240000	243000	There are heavier Quarks in the graph.
243000	248000	The purple part on the right side of the graph is the so-called basic force.
248000	250000	Everyone is more familiar with this Gamma.
250000	254000	That is the particle in the upper right corner.
254000	256000	It is the battery function that we are more familiar with.
256000	260000	The G below is the so-called強作用.
260000	263000	The Z and W are the so-called weakest.
263000	267000	In this regard, these two particles may not be often heard of.
267000	271000	Basically, today I am more focused on this Photon part.
271000	274000	I will introduce the so-called Hidden Photon later.
274000	278000	There is a Higgs in the middle of this graph.
278000	281000	You may hear this news often.
281000	282000	There is a report like this.
282000	286000	This Higgs is the source of the so-called Origin of Mass.
286000	288000	That's why matter has mass.
289000	294000	This Higgs has been predicted to exist for a long time.
294000	298000	The reason is that before it was discovered,
298000	302000	the history of standard models has been verified for a long time.
302000	304000	It is a very accurate theory.
304000	306000	But this Higgs has not been discovered.
306000	309000	This is the motivation for us to find it.
309000	314000	So I built a large-scale quantum detector in Europe later.
314000	317000	The so-called LHC.
317000	322000	I spent a lot of money on it.
322000	326000	I found it in 2013.
326000	329000	If I remember correctly, it was six or five years ago.
329000	331000	I don't know. It should be 2014.
331000	332000	I'm sorry.
332000	335000	What I want to say is that we should be able to see your mouse.
335000	337000	So you can move your mouse.
337000	339000	You can try it.
339000	341000	You can use it if you want.
341000	343000	Thank you for your advice.
343000	349000	Higgs was discovered in 2014.
349000	352000	Then, of course, the next year,
352000	355000	it seems that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Higgs.
355000	359000	It means that the last puzzle of the standard model has been found.
359000	363000	Although the standard model is so successful,
363000	368000	there are still many problems that cannot be explained.
368000	372000	These problems are listed on the right side of this video.
372000	373000	There are quite a lot.
373000	374000	Like the first so-called dark matter.
374000	379000	I'll talk about why I want to have dark matter.
379000	381000	There is also the so-called dark energy.
381000	385000	Dark energy is currently an explanation of why the universe is accelerating.
385000	388000	We observe that the universe is not static.
388000	391000	It is constantly expanding.
391000	394000	The only explanation is dark energy.
394000	397000	Simply put, it may provide some
397000	399000	similar
399000	401000	anti-gravity feeling.
401000	403000	There is also the so-called quantum gravity.
403000	405000	There is also the so-called gravity problem.
405000	406000	There is also the so-called gravity problem.
406000	407000	There is also the so-called gravity problem.
407000	409000	There is also the so-called gravity asymmetry.
409000	411000	In other words, our universe.
411000	413000	Our universe has the so-called anti-matter and positive matter.
413000	416000	But we found that our universe is basically dominant.
416000	418000	This matter is not anti-matter.
418000	424000	This is also the reason why we can't know.
424000	426000	This is a problem.
426000	428000	But although there are so many questions.
428000	432000	My speech today is mainly focused on dark matter.
432000	438000	If you are interested in this question, you can google it.
438000	441000	You can know more details.
441000	446000	Since we are talking about dark matter, we must do some basic introduction of dark matter.
447000	451000	First of all, let's talk about why we know the existence of dark matter.
451000	455000	It may be easier for everyone to understand the upper left corner of this picture.
455000	459000	The upper left corner is the rotation curve of the star system.
459000	463000	You can see the shape of this picture.
463000	468000	Its tangent axis is a planet
468000	472000	revolving around the rotation speed of the star system.
472000	477000	The horizontal axis is the distance between the star system and the center of the galaxy.
477000	485000	According to Newton's law and Newton's law of gravitation,
485000	495000	we can simply calculate that the rotation speed of the star system should be reduced.
495000	497000	If it is a galaxy, it should be reduced.
497000	504000	But what we find is not the red line, but the white line on the graph.
504000	509000	This may imply that there are some objects that we can't see.
509000	510000	It also provides gravity.
510000	516000	This gravity will produce additional gravitation to keep the star system at a certain speed.
516000	518000	This is the most basic evidence of dark matter.
518000	521000	In addition, there is a so-called gravity path.
522000	525000	For example, if the dark matter is in the universe,
525000	528000	it will cause some stars to shine.
528000	531000	The light will be distorted by the dark matter.
531000	536000	We can see the circular effect in the picture.
536000	538000	This is the so-called gravity effect.
538000	544000	There is also the CMB spectrum in the lower left corner.
544000	546000	This is more detailed.
546000	548000	I can skip it first.
548000	551000	The one on the bottom right is quite famous.
551000	556000	Someone once considered that there may be no dark matter,
556000	559000	but that Newton's law needs to be corrected.
559000	562000	There is also the so-called modified gravity theory.
562000	568000	Britt-Crosser is a more preferable evidence of dark matter.
568000	576000	You can see that Britt-Crosser has a pink and purple part on the graph.
576000	580000	The purple part is basically the matter that will provide gravity.
580000	583000	In other words, I just talked about the gravitational projection above.
583000	589000	We can know by gravitational projection that some invisible matter will provide gravity.
589000	592000	That is the purple part of the graph.
592000	595000	The red part is some visible matter that we know.
595000	597000	It may be electrons or some light.
597000	601000	We can detect it through binoculars or satellites.
602000	606000	We found that these two crosses coincide.
606000	612000	We found that the red part will interact with each other.
612000	617000	The purple part will just go through each other.
617000	621000	In other words, it will not have the same effect as our matter.
621000	626000	For example, this may also provide evidence that there is a very weak matter in the universe.
626000	628000	It's called dark matter.
629000	637000	Anyway, we found a lot of evidence from experiments or observations.
637000	640000	So dark matter is not just an evidence.
640000	643000	Its evidence is very overwhelming.
643000	651000	Since we believe in the existence of dark matter, we want to measure some of its data.
651000	654000	At present, according to our so-called cosmological standard model.
654000	657000	We just talked about the standard model of gravitational physics.
657000	659000	There is a standard model of cosmology.
659000	663000	Under that model, we do the measurement.
663000	668000	We found that the current energy ratio of the universe is like the picture.
668000	670000	This is what you see on the screen right now.
670000	674000	We generally call it cosmic pi.
675000	683000	We found that 70% of the universe's energy is contributed by dark energy.
683000	687000	Dark matter contributes about one-fourth.
687000	694000	Only 5% is contributed by the so-called barrier.
694000	698000	In other words, most of the universe can see the so-called stars.
698000	701000	It only accounts for 5% of the total energy.
701000	706000	Anyway, the focus of our speech today is on dark matter.
706000	711000	As long as you know that dark matter accounts for about one-fourth of the universe's energy.
711000	715000	What characteristics does dark matter need to meet?
715000	719000	First of all, I just said that we can't see it because of dark matter.
719000	722000	So it can't have a battery interaction.
722000	728000	Otherwise, we should be able to easily measure the signal with a device.
729000	733000	So this tells us that dark matter should be an electromagnetic.
733000	734000	It can't carry electricity.
734000	739000	Then again, its age must be older than the age of the universe.
739000	740000	Or it's very stable.
740000	744000	Otherwise, if it changes, like we know some basic examples.
744000	746000	It's not stable.
746000	748000	Uh, like the one on the screen just now.
748000	750000	In that standard model, it's called the second value.
750000	752000	For example, the second value can change to the electron.
752000	753000	Add some neutrons.
753000	755000	So some particles are not stable.
756000	759000	So if dark matter is not stable, it might change.
759000	761000	If I change, it might disappear.
761000	763000	Then we won't see it.
763000	766000	So basically, it has to be long enough for you.
766000	768000	In addition, from what I just said, this CMB.
768000	773000	And some early observations of the universe's nuclear fusion.
773000	776000	We found that it is a non-atomic substance.
776000	779000	It's not like the quarks we just talked about.
779000	781000	That kind of thing.
782000	785000	And finally, the so-called star structure is formed.
785000	788000	We estimate its movement speed.
788000	790000	In other words, particles should move in the universe.
790000	792000	Like the quarks I just mentioned.
792000	794000	It has its own velocity.
794000	797000	But the result of our observation is that our dark matter.
797000	799000	Its movement speed must be very small.
799000	801000	It's almost as small as the speed of light.
801000	802000	But to put it more directly.
802000	806000	It's almost as fast as the speed of light.
806000	808000	Compared to the speed of light.
809000	811000	This is easy to understand.
811000	814000	Do you know that dark matter itself has gravity?
814000	815000	If there is gravity.
815000	817000	They may continue to attract.
817000	819000	And form some kind of cluster feeling.
821000	824000	If the dark matter forms a cluster.
824000	826000	Other things like particles.
826000	829000	Some gravitational materials will also be attracted.
829000	830000	If you are attracted.
830000	832000	It will slowly form a star system.
832000	835000	Then this star system becomes what we are now.
835000	838000	That is to say, these stars are observed in the universe.
838000	840000	I found that most of the stars are large.
840000	843000	Most of the stars are large-diameter structures.
845000	848000	That means that the dark matter must move very slowly.
848000	850000	Because if the dark matter moves very fast.
850000	852000	It's hard to form a cluster.
852000	854000	If it's hard to form a cluster.
854000	856000	What we should see is.
856000	858000	A star with a relatively small-diameter structure.
858000	859000	Not large-diameter.
860000	862000	So the observation of large-diameter structures.
862000	864000	Dark matter moves very slowly.
864000	868000	This is basically the nature of dark matter.
869000	871000	Why is this nature important?
871000	873000	Because I just talked about the standard model.
873000	875000	There is no way to explain dark matter.
875000	879000	So it means that the standard model must be extended.
879000	881000	So you have to write some models.
881000	883000	When you write a model.
884000	886000	You have to make your model.
886000	888000	Some new substances.
888000	890000	New particles to meet these characteristics.
892000	896000	This is the basic knowledge we need to know when we do theory.
898000	900000	There is no problem here.
901000	903000	Does anyone want to know about dark matter?
905000	908000	It seems that everyone can accept it.
908000	910000	Then I will continue.
911000	913000	Since we just talked about modeling.
913000	915000	Our theorists.
915000	917000	Have to come up with some.
917000	919000	Models or scenarios to explain.
919000	921000	What is dark matter?
921000	923000	More popular is the so-called.
924000	926000	Weakly Interactive Massive Particle.
926000	928000	Generally referred to as WIMP.
931000	933000	Why is WIMP more popular?
933000	934000	Because.
935000	937000	If you use theory to estimate.
937000	939000	Find this kind of particle.
939000	941000	What about the effectiveness?
941000	944000	It's very close to what I just said in the first page.
945000	947000	At the same time, the quality is also very close.
947000	949000	So this WIMP will be very.
949000	951000	Close to the extent of our so-called circuit theory.
952000	954000	This is actually more likely to be experimentally.
955000	956000	Go.
956000	957000	Measure.
958000	959000	Of course, there are many.
959000	961000	This kind of example.
961000	963000	That's like the so-called supersymmetry theory.
964000	966000	That's like the so-called.
966000	969000	Some additional symmetry theory will also predict this kind of WIMP.
969000	970000	Candidate.
971000	973000	Then below me.
973000	976000	The blue part is.
976000	977000	Is.
977000	979000	Different from this kind of WIMP.
979000	980000	Candidate.
980000	982000	That's what I'm talking about today.
982000	984000	I'm talking about this hidden.
984000	986000	Basically, it's a.
986000	987000	Torque defect.
987000	989000	It's a topological defect.
990000	992000	It's very different from the general WIMP.
992000	994000	It's even in the early universe.
994000	995000	The mechanism is also very different.
995000	997000	I'll mention it a little bit later.
997000	999000	Simply put, I can simply say.
999000	1000000	WIMP is basically.
1000000	1002000	It was created by heat balance in the early days.
1002000	1005000	You can imagine that the universe was a big.
1005000	1007000	There are a lot of particles.
1007000	1009000	There are electrons and light.
1009000	1011000	Then these particles have high energy.
1011000	1013000	Then these high energy can hit some.
1013000	1014000	Heavier particles.
1015000	1017000	That's how WIMP was created in the early universe.
1018000	1019000	That's right.
1019000	1022000	So what about these torque defects?
1022000	1023000	What about the axis?
1023000	1025000	Its formation mechanism is not the same as WIMP.
1025000	1027000	Then I will explain.
1028000	1029000	Then I don't want blue.
1029000	1030000	It's because of these.
1030000	1033000	Particles are constantly mentioned in the back.
1033000	1035000	Like the axis and the invisible light.
1037000	1039000	I didn't particularly talk about what is HIDDEN.
1039000	1044000	HIDDEN is a sector of the visible world.
1044000	1046000	For example, I just talked about the role of the battery.
1046000	1048000	Then we can.
1048000	1050000	WIMP is very thematic.
1050000	1052000	I can say that there may be another.
1052000	1054000	A weaker battery.
1054000	1056000	Then I call it HIDDEN.
1057000	1059000	Electromagnetic.
1059000	1062000	Then you will naturally have HIDDEN photons.
1062000	1064000	Then there are a lot of candidates.
1064000	1065000	Like SIMP.
1065000	1070000	SIMP is Strongly Integrated Massive Particles.
1070000	1073000	I also sent a few papers on this work a few years ago.
1074000	1077000	It seems that my first TAL speech is about SIMP.
1078000	1080000	Then there are so-called Gravity Nodes.
1080000	1081000	There are a lot of things like this.
1081000	1083000	Basically, you can write a book.
1083000	1085000	Introduce these candidates of Fragment.
1086000	1089000	Anyway, I will focus on the blue part today.
1089000	1095000	Since there is a theory, of course there is also an experiment.
1095000	1098000	So there are a lot of people in the world right now.
1098000	1101000	Whether in Japan, the United States or Europe.
1101000	1105000	Maybe a lot of time wants to detect dark matter.
1105000	1109000	Basically, they don't want to detect the so-called WIMP.
1109000	1112000	Because WIMP has more people doing theoretical models.
1112000	1114000	More people are doing it.
1114000	1117000	They all assume that WIMP.
1117000	1118000	In fact, WIMP.
1118000	1123000	It may have some interaction with the nucleus.
1124000	1126000	Of course, these interactions are not direct.
1126000	1127000	It may pass through some media.
1127000	1129000	These media may be new physics.
1129000	1131000	Maybe it will pass through some.
1131000	1133000	Even like the fingertips I just mentioned.
1133000	1136000	Basically, this is the topic of my speech today.
1136000	1139000	Through some new.
1140000	1142000	New fermions or new bosons.
1142000	1143000	Particle to do media.
1143000	1144000	Then through this media.
1144000	1146000	Dark matter can interact with the nucleus.
1146000	1148000	Then we can go.
1148000	1150000	Do the theoretical calculation.
1150000	1152000	Then compare with the experiment.
1152000	1156000	The so-called experimental comparison is like the picture on the right.
1156000	1157000	It has.
1157000	1159000	There are some upper bound.
1159000	1162000	Like the one on the picture.
1162000	1163000	It is.
1163000	1166000	The three-color interface of WIMP and Nucleon.
1166000	1169000	Simply put, it's a three-color intensity.
1169000	1171000	The horizontal axis is the mass of WIMP.
1172000	1173000	Yes.
1173000	1175000	There are a lot of pictures on the Internet.
1175000	1176000	You see.
1176000	1179000	There are already a lot of things like COPE.
1179000	1180000	Xenon.
1180000	1181000	Like this.
1182000	1183000	Uh.
1183000	1185000	There was this a while ago.
1185000	1186000	Uh.
1187000	1190000	Xenon OneTown also released some new upper bound.
1190000	1191000	Like this.
1191000	1195000	Anyway, we have a lot of time to measure this dark matter.
1195000	1196000	Like this.
1196000	1198000	Okay, so this is the current.
1198000	1199000	Uh.
1199000	1201000	I'm just going to do the basic.
1202000	1203000	Background introduction.
1203000	1204000	There's nothing wrong with that.
1204000	1205000	I want to.
1209000	1210000	OK.
1211000	1212000	I have a question.
1212000	1213000	Good question.
1214000	1216000	But what you're showing now is.
1216000	1218000	It's almost.
1218000	1220000	One to 10,000.
1220000	1222000	10,000 GEV, right?
1222000	1223000	Yes.
1223000	1226000	Will you discuss it in this range today?
1226000	1227000	No, it's a good question.
1227000	1228000	No.
1228000	1229000	But.
1229000	1230000	I want to.
1230000	1231000	Yeah.
1231000	1232000	Yeah, because it's actually in.
1232000	1233000	You see.
1233000	1234000	You see.
1234000	1235000	Upper bound.
1235000	1236000	In the heavy part.
1236000	1237000	His.
1237000	1238000	The trend is always.
1239000	1241000	You can predict that it will continue to go up.
1241000	1242000	Extend.
1242000	1243000	That's because.
1243000	1244000	Because.
1245000	1246000	Uh.
1248000	1249000	But we know.
1249000	1250000	We can fix that.
1251000	1252000	Dark matter.
1252000	1253000	That event.
1253000	1254000	Is.
1254000	1255000	Can.
1256000	1257000	We can know.
1257000	1258000	We can press.
1258000	1260000	Then we can know this.
1260000	1261000	Strength.
1261000	1262000	So you can go.
1262000	1263000	To behave this.
1264000	1265000	He's in.
1265000	1267000	What's his behavior in the heavy part?
1267000	1268000	For example, we.
1268000	1270000	Basically, we're just doing an extension.
1272000	1274000	Then, of course, because we're talking about this today.
1276000	1277000	Monopole.
1277000	1278000	It's very heavy.
1278000	1279000	It's even more than 10.
1279000	1280000	So.
1280000	1281000	That's right.
1281000	1282000	But basically.
1282000	1284000	We just extend this upper bound.
1284000	1285000	And then do it like this.
1288000	1289000	Is that okay?
1289000	1290000	Okay.
1290000	1291000	Thank you.
1291000	1292000	Okay.
1293000	1294000	Okay.
1294000	1295000	Then I have no problem.
1295000	1296000	Let's just introduce our main character today.
1296000	1297000	The so-called hidden mobile.
1298000	1299000	So why do you have to study hidden mobile?
1299000	1300000	Because it's actually hidden mobile.
1300000	1301000	He is.
1302000	1304000	To put it bluntly, he's a pretty good candidate.
1304000	1305000	Why?
1305000	1306000	There are two very simple reasons.
1306000	1307000	That is.
1307000	1308000	He is.
1309000	1310000	If you are in the universe.
1310000	1311000	Early.
1311000	1313000	If there are some changes.
1313000	1314000	That is.
1314000	1315000	It can be very natural.
1315000	1316000	Okay.
1316000	1318000	I have a simple picture.
1318000	1319000	To explain this.
1320000	1321000	That's right.
1321000	1322000	You can think of it before the change.
1322000	1323000	That is.
1323000	1324000	I.
1324000	1325000	I.
1325000	1326000	The square on this picture.
1326000	1327000	This rectangle.
1327000	1329000	I'm talking about the universe.
1329000	1330000	Of course.
1330000	1331000	It's not just empty.
1331000	1332000	I'm just saying.
1332000	1333000	Before the change.
1333000	1334000	His.
1334000	1335000	This.
1335000	1336000	The shape of a factory is.
1336000	1337000	It's zero.
1337000	1338000	He's got nothing.
1338000	1339000	That's it.
1339000	1341000	And then after the change.
1341000	1342000	Maybe.
1342000	1343000	Well.
1343000	1344000	Some blocks in the universe.
1344000	1345000	Will.
1345000	1346000	There will be some new ones.
1346000	1347000	Maybe some.
1348000	1349000	New scalar field.
1349000	1350000	He will send.
1350000	1351000	There will be some vacuum expectations.
1352000	1353000	And then this scalar field.
1353000	1354000	There will be some random directions.
1355000	1356000	That's because the universe.
1356000	1357000	The universe is.
1358000	1360000	Do you know that the universe is a cause and effect ratio?
1360000	1362000	So we'll have some domains.
1363000	1364000	That these domains are.
1364000	1365000	Cause.
1365000	1366000	Causality connection.
1366000	1367000	Connected.
1367000	1368000	That is.
1368000	1369000	It has a cause and effect relationship.
1369000	1370000	So in different domains.
1370000	1371000	His.
1371000	1372000	The direction may be different.
1372000	1373000	This is a bit like you.
1373000	1374000	Maybe.
1375000	1376000	Electrical engineering or some.
1376000	1377000	It's your magnet.
1377000	1378000	There will be some.
1378000	1379000	That domain phenomenon is very similar.
1380000	1381000	Anyway.
1381000	1382000	So.
1382000	1383000	In the following.
1383000	1383000	
1383000	1384000	I seem to have a typo below.
1384000	1385000	It should be after the change.
1385000	1386000	That's not before the change.
1386000	1387000	I just changed it.
1387000	1388000	Yeah.
1388000	1389000	So there's this random direction.
1389000	1391000	Then you might have a certain chance.
1391000	1392000	It's just like.
1392000	1393000	In this picture.
1394000	1395000	The four in the lower right corner.
1396000	1397000	He just formed a radiation.
1397000	1398000	There is no.
1398000	1399000	That's the radiation.
1399000	1400000	It's like our battery factory.
1401000	1402000	That.
1402000	1403000	Since there's a battery factory.
1403000	1404000	We can find the center.
1404000	1405000	So you can say.
1405000	1406000	What about this center?
1406000	1407000	It can be identified.
1407000	1408000	It's a.
1408000	1409000	Maybe it's a kind of.
1409000	1410000	Something with a magnet.
1411000	1412000	Yeah.
1412000	1413000	In our example.
1413000	1414000	It's a magnet.
1414000	1415000	It's got a flux.
1415000	1416000	Yeah.
1416000	1417000	So there's this magnet.
1417000	1418000	It will produce.
1418000	1419000	It will produce this magnetic field.
1419000	1420000	So.
1420000	1421000	For example, if there is a change.
1421000	1422000	These.
1423000	1424000	These.
1424000	1426000	These objects will naturally occur.
1426000	1427000	That's the red dot on the picture.
1427000	1428000	That's it.
1428000	1429000	Then we can estimate.
1429000	1430000	This number density.
1431000	1432000	I'm on the screen.
1433000	1434000	Uh.
1434000	1435000	The data is written.
1435000	1436000	It's this nm.
1436000	1437000	It's this.
1437000	1438000	The number density of the monopole.
1438000	1439000	It will.
1440000	1441000	It will be equal to this.
1441000	1442000	1 divided by this.
1443000	1444000	Horizontal size of this.
1445000	1446000	The three-dimensional.
1446000	1447000	It's the volume.
1447000	1448000	That is to say, roughly.
1448000	1449000	It's probably an average one.
1449000	1450000	In a.
1451000	1452000	This British law.
1452000	1453000	Connected.
1453000	1454000	In this volume.
1454000	1455000	It will produce a.
1455000	1456000	Magnetic field.
1456000	1457000	That's it.
1457000	1458000	Yeah, that's it.
1458000	1459000	This.
1459000	1460000	This.
1461000	1462000	This dh.
1462000	1463000	This horizon distance.
1463000	1464000	It's roughly.
1465000	1466000	It's about the same as this.
1466000	1467000	This.
1467000	1468000	This.
1468000	1469000	Negative three-dimensional.
1469000	1470000	That's it.
1470000	1471000	Then we can estimate.
1471000	1472000	This number density.
1472000	1473000	It's h.
1473000	1474000	Negative three-dimensional.
1474000	1475000	Then we can estimate.
1475000	1476000	It's this.
1476000	1477000	The density.
1477000	1478000	I have a question.
1478000	1479000	Good question.
1479000	1480000	My question is.
1480000	1481000	That is.
1481000	1482000	My question is.
1482000	1483000	The main thing is that molecule.
1483000	1484000	Is 1.
1484000	1485000	That is to say.
1485000	1486000	If you are in a causal.
1486000	1487000	Connected horizon.
1487000	1488000	There is more than one.
1488000	1489000	It doesn't look like.
1489000	1490000	It's a monopole.
1490000	1491000	It looks like.
1491000	1492000	It's a dipole.
1492000	1493000	Or a multipole.
1493000	1494000	Right?
1494000	1495000	Yeah, there's a lot of.
1495000	1496000	Yeah, yeah.
1496000	1497000	But.
1497000	1498000	So.
1498000	1499000	I see.
1499000	1500000	So.
1500000	1501000	You would say.
1501000	1502000	It's one over.
1502000	1503000	Horizon size.
1503000	1504000	Because.
1504000	1505000	Basically.
1505000	1506000	You have to.
1506000	1507000	Usually.
1507000	1508000	Write a P.
1508000	1509000	P is probability.
1509000	1510000	Uh-huh.
1510000	1511000	But.
1511000	1512000	I didn't go.
1512000	1513000	To see how to calculate.
1513000	1514000	That depends on model.
1514000	1515000	Yeah.
1515000	1516000	But I'm just giving it a scale.
1516000	1517000	Yeah.
1517000	1518000	Like my paper here.
1518000	1519000	It's just.
1519000	1520000	It's just a number.
1520000	1521000	I can't.
1521000	1522000	It's not that I can't.
1522000	1523000	I didn't really go.
1523000	1524000	Calculate so carefully.
1524000	1525000	Because the reason is simple.
1525000	1526000	Because.
1526000	1528000	You know, there are a lot of experiments.
1528000	1529000	Yeah.
1529000	1530000	Hahaha.
1530000	1531000	Sorry.
1531000	1532000	Yeah.
1532000	1533000	Yeah.
1533000	1534000	Yeah.
1534000	1535000	Yeah.
1535000	1536000	Yeah.
1536000	1537000	Yeah.
1537000	1538000	Yeah.
1538000	1539000	Yeah.
1539000	1540000	Yeah.
1540000	1541000	Yeah.
1541000	1542000	Yeah.
1542000	1545000	How much density should this monopole have?
1545000	1546000	Or is it just density?
1546000	1547000	Because we know that density.
1547000	1549000	That's the mass density.
1549000	1551000	That's the mass density.
1552000	1554000	So it's going to be very natural in the universe.
1554000	1555000	If there's a change.
1555000	1556000	Yeah.
1556000	1557000	That's actually.
1557000	1558000	You know, there's a lot of change in the universe.
1558000	1559000	So it's very natural.
1559000	1560000	It's a natural thing.
1560000	1562000	If there's the same thing in this hidden sector.
1562000	1563000	Then this level 13.
1563000	1565000	This hidden level 13 can be produced by itself.
1565000	1566000	It's very natural.
1567000	1568000	And then there's him.
1568000	1569000	Because he's Thorpe.
1569000	1570000	Thorpe.
1570000	1571000	Thorpe.
1571000	1572000	Thorpe.
1572000	1574000	So he has a kind of his own.
1574000	1575000	The nature of Thorpe.
1575000	1578000	I don't know if you're familiar with Thorpe.
1578000	1580000	Like Thorpe, which is usually used to talk about Thorpe.
1580000	1581000	That's Mark Bay.
1581000	1582000	You know, Mark Bay.
1583000	1586000	It's the same as the field circle.
1586000	1587000	Thorpe is the same.
1587000	1588000	Yeah.
1588000	1589000	It's a more mathematical language.
1589000	1590000	That is to say, this kind of Thorpe.
1590000	1592000	Thorpe's object has its own.
1592000	1593000	This is quantum number.
1594000	1595000	That's quantum number.
1595000	1596000	If it's.
1596000	1597000	If it's not destroyed.
1597000	1599000	It's a very good hand.
1599000	1601000	So if it's a hand, it means.
1601000	1604000	If this model has this quantum number.
1604000	1606000	It's a very stable thing.
1607000	1609000	That chemical reaction is not electrical.
1609000	1610000	You can't.
1610000	1611000	Before and after the reaction.
1612000	1613000	Before the reaction, it's very.
1613000	1614000	Total charge is.
1614000	1615000	It's positive and negative.
1615000	1616000	And then you get negative after the reaction.
1616000	1617000	Something like that.
1617000	1618000	Yeah.
1618000	1619000	That can explain the dark matter.
1619000	1620000	This hidden model.
1620000	1621000	Why is it stable?
1621000	1622000	Yeah.
1622000	1623000	Because he can't detect some particles.
1623000	1624000	It also has the same Thorpe.
1625000	1626000	This number.
1626000	1627000	So anyway.
1627000	1629000	So this is two basic reasons.
1629000	1630000	That's the hidden model.
1631000	1632000	Good.
1632000	1633000	Of course.
1633000	1634000	Uh.
1634000	1635000	I'm in the hidden model.
1635000	1637000	So basically there are some.
1637000	1639000	Of course, some studies of the same theory.
1639000	1640000	Like what.
1640000	1641000	Su5 theory.
1641000	1643000	They naturally have some models.
1643000	1644000	But what about these models?
1645000	1648000	If you calculate it, you'll find it.
1649000	1650000	It's going to be a lot.
1650000	1651000	Yeah.
1651000	1652000	That's going to lead to.
1653000	1655000	It's going to be the same as we observe.
1655000	1656000	It's going to be different from what we observe.
1656000	1658000	Because we're in the universe right now.
1658000	1660000	The universe has no evidence of any particles.
1661000	1662000	And then that's going to lead to another question.
1662000	1663000	That's what this is.
1664000	1665000	Why isn't the universe like this?
1665000	1667000	There's no such thing as a general model.
1667000	1669000	Well, that might have to be generally explained by inferential.
1669000	1670000	Yeah.
1670000	1671000	Well, this is another one.
1671000	1674000	The bottom line is that the early universe will explode.
1674000	1677000	And then it's going to suck up the density of this model.
1677000	1678000	Yeah.
1678000	1680000	And here, it's not the same as my hidden model.
1680000	1681000	Yeah.
1682000	1683000	Even if I'm in the dark matter.
1683000	1684000	So.
1685000	1687000	It's going to have a lot of density.
1688000	1690000	Yeah, basically, it's supposed to be.
1690000	1692000	It has to be produced after this explosion.
1692000	1694000	If it's produced before the explosion,
1694000	1696000	It's going to be sucked up, too.
1696000	1697000	OK.
1697000	1698000	Good.
1699000	1701000	That's what I was trying to do.
1701000	1703000	You have a wrong notation.
1704000	1705000	That DH is.
1705000	1708000	Equal to H or equal to H minus.
1709000	1710000	Minus.
1710000	1711000	It should be minus.
1711000	1712000	Minus.
1712000	1714000	Because you don't seem to be right about these two, do you?
1714000	1715000	I might be writing.
1715000	1716000	I might be typing.
1716000	1717000	Yeah, I might have a short time.
1717000	1718000	Yeah.
1718000	1719000	Which one is the title?
1720000	1721000	Yeah, it's supposed to be three-dimensional.
1721000	1722000	You're talking about that.
1722000	1723000	Yeah.
1723000	1724000	Three-dimensional.
1724000	1725000	OK.
1725000	1726000	Good.
1726000	1727000	Thank you.
1727000	1728000	Good.
1728000	1729000	that.
1730000	1731000	I just mentioned the experiment.
1731000	1732000	That is to say, we.
1733000	1735000	Can we measure this?
1735000	1738000	This model can measure this hidden model.
1738000	1740000	The answer is no.
1740000	1741000	Because I just said.
1741000	1743000	If you're this dark matter.
1743000	1744000	Really with.
1745000	1746000	What about the effect of this box?
1746000	1747000	I need some media.
1748000	1749000	So if it's just a.
1750000	1751000	Hidden model, this model.
1751000	1752000	Maybe there's no way.
1752000	1753000	There's this connection.
1753000	1754000	So I don't have to.
1754000	1755000	Do some extra extension.
1755000	1757000	That is to say, you have to add extra particles.
1757000	1758000	Yeah.
1759000	1761000	Let this model and this box.
1761000	1762000	There's a connection.
1763000	1764000	Good.
1764000	1765000	There are a few possibilities.
1767000	1768000	Good.
1768000	1769000	The first one is the Higgs portal.
1769000	1770000	That is to say.
1770000	1772000	In the middle, they rely on Higgs particles to make media.
1773000	1774000	That's a simple estimate.
1774000	1775000	I'm not going to explain it.
1775000	1777000	That is, I found this prediction.
1777000	1778000	This.
1778000	1779000	The war front is very small.
1781000	1783000	There's another one that wants to go through this vector.
1783000	1784000	For example, the middle is.
1785000	1786000	The media is a kind of light.
1786000	1787000	These things.
1788000	1789000	That.
1789000	1790000	That.
1790000	1791000	Sorry.
1791000	1792000	I don't study because of this.
1793000	1794000	Toppling is very small because.
1794000	1795000	This kind of vector.
1796000	1798000	It's been limited by a lot of experiments.
1799000	1800000	So it's usually this.
1800000	1801000	It's not big enough.
1801000	1802000	So our research theme today is.
1802000	1803000	This action.
1803000	1804000	You mean.
1805000	1807000	This media is made by action.
1808000	1810000	That action is the most primitive.
1810000	1813000	The first reason is that he solved it.
1813000	1814000	Just maybe.
1815000	1817000	I didn't get this strong CP problem.
1818000	1820000	Yeah, and then in this hypothesis.
1820000	1821000	Or some super-symmetry.
1821000	1824000	It's natural to predict this kind of action particle.
1825000	1826000	Yeah, so.
1826000	1829000	The action particle may exist in the intelligent world.
1829000	1832000	Well, actually, as long as you know the action, it's a simple one.
1833000	1835000	There's no, it's a, it's a pure particle.
1835000	1836000	That's it.
1836000	1837000	It's not self-selected.
1838000	1839000	It's a spin-zero particle.
1840000	1842000	And then it's a pseudo-scalar at the same time.
1842000	1845000	The so-called pseudo means that it's in this mirror symmetry.
1845000	1846000	It's got a symbol.
1847000	1848000	I mean.
1848000	1849000	Uh.
1849000	1850000	So.
1850000	1852000	If it's a normal scale, it won't be like Higgs.
1852000	1854000	Higgs is just a normal scale.
1854000	1855000	It's in.
1855000	1857000	But the parity is in the mirror symmetry.
1857000	1859000	It doesn't have a minus sign in the mirror symmetry.
1859000	1862000	Yeah, anyway, so, anyway, so action is a.
1863000	1864000	It's a pseudo-scalar.
1865000	1867000	So, basically, what I'm doing today is assuming.
1868000	1869000	This hidden multiple.
1871000	1875000	With this, uh, uh, with the middle of the nucleus through this action to make a connection.
1875000	1876000	Oh.
1880000	1882000	Well, then it's a more complex model.
1882000	1883000	Then this side.
1883000	1885000	Maybe a lot of people don't understand.
1885000	1887000	Yeah, I'll talk about it a little bit.
1887000	1888000	The earliest.
1889000	1890000	Uh, put it out.
1891000	1893000	That is to say, a theory is very natural to have multiple.
1893000	1894000	It's this one.
1894000	1898000	He's also a theoretical physicist.
1898000	1899000	He's in the Netherlands.
1900000	1902000	And then he has a Nobel Prize.
1903000	1905000	Then he proposed this so-called SU2.
1906000	1909000	SU2 is basically a standard symmetry.
1909000	1912000	Well, to put it simply, people are more familiar with this battery.
1912000	1914000	It's a U1 symmetry.
1915000	1916000	That U1, it's a.
1918000	1920000	It's a non-exchange group symmetry.
1920000	1921000	The so-called exchange is to say.
1922000	1925000	So, as you know, people have learned to be more familiar with rotation.
1925000	1927000	Basically, the three-dimensional rotation is a.
1929000	1932000	The role of a non-exchange group symmetry.
1932000	1935000	Because you, you first turn from the y-axis and then from the z-axis.
1935000	1938000	You can turn from the z-axis and then from the y-axis.
1938000	1939000	It's different.
1939000	1940000	Yeah.
1940000	1942000	That's why U1 is an exchange.
1942000	1944000	The exchange is that it's a flat rotation.
1944000	1946000	Flat rotation is an exchangeable.
1947000	1948000	That.
1948000	1950000	Yeah, he proposed a SU2.
1950000	1952000	This non-exchange group symmetry.
1952000	1953000	The theory.
1953000	1955000	And then he added three of these.
1956000	1957000	New scale.
1957000	1958000	For example, you can see this in the picture.
1958000	1959000	Phi 1, phi 2, phi 3.
1959000	1962000	What about the structure of this theory?
1962000	1963000	What if this happens?
1963000	1964000	This self-reliance.
1964000	1965000	What about the destruction?
1965000	1967000	It will be very natural to produce this.
1967000	1969000	That he was a long time ago.
1969000	1971000	With another one.
1971000	1972000	This.
1972000	1973000	This.
1973000	1974000	This.
1974000	1976000	They didn't cooperate before.
1976000	1978000	They both came up with this idea.
1978000	1979000	That's it.
1979000	1980000	Yeah, and then down here is this.
1980000	1982000	The screen is some of the equations.
1982000	1983000	You don't really need to.
1984000	1985000	To understand.
1985000	1988000	You just need to know that I'm using pink to mark this.
1988000	1989000	Like EH.
1989000	1991000	EH is similar to our battery.
1991000	1992000	The battery.
1992000	1994000	Just because it's a hidden sector.
1994000	1996000	So I add an H to mark it.
1996000	1998000	It's different from our average.
1998000	1999000	This.
1999000	2000000	The size of the battery.
2001000	2002000	And then VH.
2002000	2003000	On the right.
2003000	2004000	The VH on the right is this.
2004000	2006000	The vacuum expectation value of the storage plant.
2006000	2007000	That he will.
2007000	2009000	It's related to this.
2009000	2010000	Yeah.
2010000	2012000	Anyway, it's a model.
2012000	2014000	That he will naturally have this.
2017000	2018000	That's it.
2018000	2019000	You don't have to look at it.
2019000	2020000	Of course, it's what I just said.
2020000	2021000	This model.
2021000	2023000	If there is a self-reliance.
2023000	2025000	Self-reliance destruction.
2025000	2027000	Then it will produce U1.
2028000	2029000	That U1 will become.
2029000	2030000	Simply put.
2030000	2031000	That is to say.
2031000	2033000	The role of our average battery is.
2033000	2034000	It's U1.
2034000	2035000	U1 symmetry.
2035000	2036000	So if he has a U1H.
2036000	2037000	It's natural to have one.
2037000	2039000	In the hidden sector.
2039000	2040000	This battery.
2041000	2042000	What about this alpha H?
2042000	2043000	This is the red one.
2043000	2044000	This alpha H is.
2044000	2046000	It should be the economic structure parameter.
2046000	2047000	Yeah.
2047000	2048000	That's the same.
2048000	2049000	He's in the hidden sector right now.
2051000	2052000	Oh.
2052000	2053000	Look at the time.
2053000	2054000	About 20 minutes.
2054000	2055000	Good.
2055000	2056000	That's what I just said.
2056000	2057000	If this model.
2058000	2059000	If you assume this model.
2059000	2060000	He's this.
2060000	2061000	Energy is self-reliance.
2061000	2062000	That is to say.
2062000	2063000	If his energy is finite.
2063000	2064000	That will naturally be a.
2064000	2065000	Very stable.
2065000	2066000	This.
2066000	2068000	This state solution.
2068000	2070000	It's like the solution of Soliton.
2070000	2071000	He's a model.
2073000	2075000	And then there's some of this model.
2076000	2077000	Some new particles.
2077000	2078000	That's the first one.
2078000	2080000	Gamma H is hidden photon.
2080000	2081000	Of course, hidden photon.
2081000	2082000	It's not qualitative.
2082000	2083000	It's not electronic.
2083000	2084000	It's not.
2084000	2085000	It's not.
2085000	2086000	There's no magnetic field.
2086000	2087000	Yeah.
2088000	2089000	And then this alpha.
2089000	2090000	This.
2090000	2091000	This is what I just said.
2091000	2092000	Some of this model.
2092000	2093000	Scalar like this.
2093000	2094000	That's a lot of mass.
2094000	2095000	But he didn't.
2096000	2097000	There's no electric field.
2097000	2098000	There's no magnetic field.
2098000	2099000	And then the third one.
2099000	2100000	This is.
2100000	2101000	Standard symmetrical example.
2101000	2102000	We usually call it W.
2102000	2103000	The government.
2104000	2105000	He's actually talking to us.
2105000	2106000	The first page of that standard model.
2106000	2107000	That W is very similar.
2107000	2108000	That's the same.
2108000	2109000	He's in the hidden sector.
2110000	2111000	That.
2111000	2112000	That's natural.
2112000	2113000	He's going to have an electric field.
2113000	2114000	Yeah.
2114000	2115000	And then the last one, M.
2115000	2116000	That's our protagonist.
2116000	2117000	That's the model.
2117000	2118000	That's natural.
2118000	2119000	It has to be qualitative.
2119000	2120000	And then since it's a model.
2120000	2122000	Of course, it has to have magnetic field.
2122000	2123000	It's magnetic charge.
2125000	2126000	Of course.
2126000	2128000	There's a question here.
2128000	2129000	That is to say.
2129000	2130000	If it is.
2130000	2131000	He's a.
2131000	2132000	If it's a model.
2132000	2134000	Why does he have an electric field?
2134000	2135000	It's kind of weird.
2137000	2140000	That's a very interesting theory.
2140000	2142000	He was in Princeton a long time ago.
2143000	2144000	Now in Princeton.
2144000	2145000	This Witten.
2145000	2146000	A.
2146000	2148000	It's one of the most powerful.
2148000	2150000	It's supposed to be the top linguist.
2151000	2152000	He was a long time ago.
2152000	2153000	The so-called Witten effect.
2155000	2157000	For example, through this Witten effect.
2157000	2158000	This monopole.
2158000	2159000	It will also have.
2159000	2160000	This electric field.
2160000	2161000	This is quite interesting.
2161000	2162000	This is when I first learned it.
2162000	2163000	I think it's amazing.
2163000	2164000	And it's very simple.
2165000	2166000	Okay, so.
2166000	2167000	So why is there this.
2167000	2168000	Electric field?
2170000	2171000	So if you say.
2171000	2172000	If you today.
2172000	2173000	As I just said.
2173000	2174000	If you have one now.
2174000	2176000	The theory of this one.
2176000	2178000	Basically, we can also write it on the screen.
2178000	2179000	This equation.
2179000	2180000	This Lagrangian.
2182000	2183000	Okay, so back to the front.
2183000	2184000	You see this.
2185000	2187000	The Lagrangian has a cth.
2187000	2188000	That's cth.
2188000	2190000	It's called cth.
2190000	2191000	For example, we.
2191000	2192000	We can write this.
2192000	2194000	And then it won't violate anything.
2197000	2198000	No, no, no, no, no.
2198000	2199000	There's no reason.
2199000	2200000	It doesn't exist.
2200000	2201000	So we can write it down.
2201000	2202000	Yeah.
2202000	2203000	Okay.
2203000	2204000	Well, usually this term is.
2204000	2206000	We don't consider it because.
2207000	2208000	It can be written as a whole.
2209000	2210000	And in the whole.
2210000	2212000	Basically, it doesn't have any physical effect.
2212000	2214000	Yeah, maybe you're not familiar with it.
2214000	2215000	Then I'll mention it a little bit.
2216000	2218000	So when will this term have a physical effect?
2218000	2219000	That's if you have it today.
2219000	2220000	You have this.
2220000	2221000	Monopole background.
2222000	2224000	If you have a monopole background today.
2224000	2225000	Plus this cth term.
2226000	2228000	You can find out that this monopole.
2228000	2230000	It also has a background.
2232000	2234000	Well, usually I put this kind of thing with a background.
2234000	2235000	It's called Dayong.
2235000	2236000	Yeah.
2236000	2238000	But we're talking about this today.
2238000	2240000	Or just call it monopole.
2240000	2241000	Yeah.
2241000	2242000	So simply put.
2242000	2244000	If you have this cth term today.
2244000	2246000	If you have this monopole at the same time.
2246000	2247000	Yeah, because I just said.
2247000	2248000	I just said.
2248000	2249000	In this series.
2249000	2250000	In this series.
2250000	2251000	There's always going to be a monopole.
2251000	2252000	Yeah.
2252000	2254000	So you have this cth term and monopole.
2254000	2255000	Then you calculate it.
2255000	2257000	You'll find that it should have a monopole at the same time.
2257000	2258000	Well, since there's a monopole.
2258000	2259000	It's going to have a monopole.
2260000	2261000	OK, so his monopole is in.
2262000	2265000	The shape of the red part in the lower right corner.
2265000	2266000	Yeah.
2266000	2268000	So that you can get a feel for it.
2268000	2269000	I'm going to show you some calculations.
2269000	2270000	Yeah, like this.
2271000	2273000	For example, you just got out of this Lagrangian.
2273000	2275000	You can write down its equation motion.
2275000	2277000	It's the one on the top left.
2277000	2278000	The one in the upper left corner.
2278000	2279000	The yellow equation.
2280000	2283000	And through our definition of this battery voltage.
2283000	2286000	It's in the upper right corner.
2286000	2287000	Like what?
2287000	2288000	FJ 0 equals EJ.
2288000	2289000	This kind of thing.
2289000	2290000	E is the power plant.
2290000	2291000	And then B is the power plant.
2292000	2293000	You can get that.
2294000	2296000	We're most familiar with the Maxwell equation.
2296000	2297000	Like that.
2297000	2298000	You know, the frequency.
2298000	2299000	The power plant.
2299000	2301000	If it's usually 0.
2301000	2302000	Well, if it's usually 0.
2302000	2304000	If there's no power consumption, it should be 0.
2305000	2306000	Yeah.
2306000	2307000	So we can say this.
2307000	2308000	This Maxwell equation.
2309000	2311000	So if you're today.
2311000	2313000	Through this Maxwell equation.
2313000	2314000	If you have a multiple.
2315000	2316000	You can do the same thing.
2316000	2317000	Calculate this voltage.
2317000	2318000	Okay.
2318000	2319000	So if you're interested.
2319000	2320000	You can.
2320000	2321000	After the lecture.
2321000	2322000	You can take a closer look at this.
2322000	2323000	It's actually pretty simple.
2324000	2325000	OK.
2325000	2327000	So you can just look at this theta H.
2327000	2329000	This theta H is in this.
2329000	2330000	In the micro-division.
2330000	2331000	In this.
2331000	2332000	In the delta dot.
2332000	2333000	So that means theta.
2333000	2334000	It's basically.
2334000	2335000	It can also be a.
2336000	2337000	Space function.
2338000	2339000	Yeah.
2339000	2340000	Because I'm going to extend it later.
2340000	2341000	It's an action.
2341000	2342000	Action.
2342000	2343000	It's a.
2343000	2344000	It's a.
2344000	2345000	It's a factory.
2345000	2346000	That factory.
2346000	2347000	It's a space function.
2347000	2348000	That is to say.
2348000	2349000	If you enter today.
2349000	2350000	It's not just theta.
2350000	2351000	It's a.
2351000	2352000	It's an action.
2352000	2353000	Then this.
2353000	2354000	This.
2354000	2355000	What about the voltage?
2355000	2356000	It's not going to be at the origin.
2356000	2357000	That.
2357000	2358000	That origin.
2358000	2359000	It's going to be in space.
2359000	2360000	Through this action.
2360000	2361000	It will.
2361000	2363000	It will be carried by this action field.
2364000	2365000	OK.
2365000	2366000	Okay.
2366000	2367000	Is there any problem here?
2367000	2368000	Although it's a bit difficult.
2370000	2372000	Yes, I have a question.
2372000	2374000	So basically you.
2374000	2376000	Model will be coupled to dark photon.
2376000	2377000	But it's with.
2377000	2378000	It's you.
2378000	2380000	The coupling of monopole and dark photon.
2380000	2382000	You have to argue now.
2382000	2383000	It's like saying.
2383000	2385000	Its coupling is dependent on.
2385000	2386000	One.
2386000	2388000	A field that can change with space.
2388000	2389000	That's the theta.
2389000	2390000	And then.
2390000	2391000	You said that.
2391000	2392000	That theta.
2392000	2393000	You think.
2393000	2394000	It's a field.
2394000	2395000	So you said it.
2395000	2396000	OK.
2396000	2397000	It's x.
2397000	2398000	Is that so?
2398000	2399000	No.
2399000	2400000	That is.
2400000	2401000	You can repeat.
2401000	2402000	For example, look at me.
2402000	2403000	I'm not writing a theta.
2403000	2404000	Like this.
2404000	2405000	I can change this theta.
2405000	2406000	It's a time and space function.
2406000	2407000	You can.
2407000	2408000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2408000	2409000	So this thing is your x.
2409000	2410000	Yeah.
2410000	2411000	Yeah.
2411000	2412000	But.
2412000	2413000	That is to say.
2413000	2414000	You are now.
2414000	2415000	It's basically you.
2415000	2416000	It's his.
2416000	2417000	That.
2417000	2418000	That monopole charge.
2418000	2419000	So he basically.
2419000	2420000	You and.
2420000	2421000	Dark photon.
2421000	2422000	The coupling is.
2425000	2426000	Basically, I'll write it down.
2426000	2427000	It's him.
2427000	2428000	Do you know what he looks like?
2428000	2429000	Or what?
2432000	2433000	Is that what you mean?
2433000	2435000	Undensity.
2436000	2437000	Um.
2438000	2439000	What did you say?
2439000	2440000	I didn't hear it.
2442000	2443000	Hello.
2445000	2446000	Hello.
2446000	2447000	Hello.
2449000	2450000	Um.
2450000	2451000	Did you hear that?
2451000	2452000	Did you hear that?
2456000	2457000	Hello.
2461000	2462000	I heard his voice.
2463000	2464000	Zhang Yong.
2466000	2467000	Zhang Yong is missing.
2467000	2468000	Why?
2472000	2473000	Did the others hear my voice?
2476000	2477000	Have.
2477000	2478000	Zhang Yong is missing.
2479000	2480000	No.
2482000	2483000	Wait a minute.
2483000	2484000	He is.
2486000	2487000	Is he online?
2489000	2490000	Have.
2490000	2491000	Have.
2491000	2492000	But no sound.
2494000	2495000	Yeah.
2495000	2496000	Wait a minute.
2496000	2497000	I don't know what's going on.
2506000	2507000	I have.
2510000	2512000	I'm going to send him a message.
2534000	2535000	I pressed it, didn't I?
2535000	2536000	Wait a minute.
2541000	2542000	He's gone.
2547000	2548000	So I should keep talking and wait for him.
2555000	2556000	You have to wait for him.
2557000	2558000	Have you seen my screen?
2558000	2559000	Have you seen my screen?
2559000	2560000	No.
2560000	2561000	No?
2561000	2562000	I just pressed share.
2565000	2566000	Have you seen my screen?
2569000	2570000	Have you seen my screen?
2572000	2573000	He's gone.
2573000	2574000	He's gone.
2576000	2577000	I'm still recording.
2578000	2579000	Then I'll continue.
2579000	2580000	Because...
2580000	2581000	Yeah.
2581000	2582000	I'll talk to him later.
2582000	2583000	Yeah.
2584000	2585000	I have a question.
2586000	2589000	Is the charge
2589000	2592000	the same as our EM charge?
2592000	2593000	No.
2593000	2594000	It's different.
2594000	2595000	It's different.
2595000	2596000	So you're basically
2596000	2599000	copying the EM wave again.
2599000	2600000	Yeah, it's very simple.
2600000	2601000	It's a very small coupling
2601000	2603000	to our whole world.
2608000	2609000	It doesn't have to be big or small.
2609000	2611000	It's all right.
2611000	2613000	But the main thing is that we can't
2613000	2614000	get close to it.
2615000	2616000	Yeah, basically...
2616000	2617000	I'll talk about it later.
2617000	2619000	In fact, the coupling is quite large.
2619000	2620000	That is to say...
2620000	2622000	I don't know if I'm using EH now.
2622000	2624000	I'm using the electron structure constant.
2624000	2626000	Like I just said, alpha H.
2626000	2627000	Like I'm in the back.
2627000	2628000	The numerical study is about
2628000	2629000	close to 1.
2629000	2630000	But the general...
2630000	2631000	You know, the general electron
2631000	2632000	effect electron structure constant
2632000	2633000	is about
2633000	2634000	10 to the power of 2
2634000	2636000	divided by 137 or something.
2636000	2637000	Yeah.
2639000	2640000	I'm back.
2640000	2641000	I'm sorry.
2641000	2642000	If you just answered
2642000	2643000	and I skipped it completely,
2643000	2644000	it doesn't matter.
2644000	2645000	Just ignore me.
2645000	2646000	I'm sorry.
2646000	2647000	Yeah.
2647000	2648000	We can discuss it later.
2649000	2650000	OK.
2650000	2651000	Let's continue.
2651000	2653000	Anyway, this is actually quite simple.
2653000	2654000	You can see the video later.
2654000	2656000	You can push it yourself.
2656000	2657000	If I were a professor,
2657000	2658000	I would ask this question.
2658000	2659000	It's really simple.
2659000	2660000	OK.
2661000	2662000	This is my model here.
2662000	2664000	This is Benchmark Point.
2664000	2665000	Yeah.
2665000	2666000	In fact, this model has already
2666000	2667000	done some detailed research.
2667000	2668000	But so far,
2668000	2670000	no one has really considered
2670000	2671000	how this multiple
2671000	2672000	and
2672000	2674000	the numerical effect through action.
2674000	2675000	But we're...
2675000	2676000	My boss is the first one
2676000	2677000	to come up with this idea.
2677000	2679000	Then he asked me to do the calculation.
2679000	2681000	So you can see this on the picture.
2681000	2683000	This picture is made by someone else.
2683000	2684000	Yeah.
2684000	2687000	I put the credit in the upper right corner.
2687000	2688000	For example,
2688000	2690000	you can see this tangent axis on the picture.
2690000	2693000	This is the size of the energy structure.
2693000	2696000	The horizontal axis is the size of the positive and negative expectant.
2696000	2700000	It corresponds to the value of this multiple.
2700000	2701000	Yeah.
2701000	2702000	That's the red part.
2702000	2704000	That's the red part.
2704000	2706000	We're going to consider this.
2706000	2708000	Consider the red part on the picture.
2708000	2709000	The red part on the picture.
2709000	2710000	That is to say.
2712000	2713000	I forgot to say something.
2713000	2714000	In this model,
2714000	2715000	in addition to this multiple,
2715000	2717000	you can do dark matter.
2717000	2720000	The one in the table.
2720000	2721000	W.
2721000	2723000	W positive can also do dark matter.
2723000	2724000	Yeah.
2724000	2725000	Why is this model?
2725000	2726000	It considers
2726000	2727000	I'm 100%
2727000	2729000	This dark matter is contributed by multiple.
2729000	2730000	Yeah.
2730000	2732000	So consider maybe 10% or 35% like this.
2732000	2735000	Then we use its result directly.
2735000	2736000	To do the analysis.
2736000	2737000	Yeah.
2737000	2738000	But anyway, in principle,
2738000	2741000	we can reproduce its results.
2741000	2742000	Yeah.
2742000	2744000	But our paper here is mainly.
2744000	2745000	As long as.
2745000	2747000	Estimate a number level.
2747000	2748000	Yeah.
2748000	2750000	We use its result directly.
2750000	2751000	Okay.
2751000	2752000	Then we assume that this.
2752000	2754000	Dark matter is contributed by 35%.
2754000	2755000	Dark matter is.
2755000	2758000	35% of it is contributed by this multiple.
2758000	2759000	Okay.
2759000	2760000	In this case,
2760000	2761000	the average is about 0.7.
2761000	2763000	Then this multiple is very heavy.
2763000	2765000	About 200 TeV.
2766000	2767000	Yeah.
2767000	2768000	That's for reference.
2768000	2769000	Like the one just now.
2769000	2770000	I asked before.
2770000	2771000	Is that.
2771000	2772000	The experiment of WIMP.
2772000	2775000	It's going to be 10 to the power of 4.
2775000	2776000	So 10 to the power of 4.
2776000	2778000	It's only about 10 TeV.
2778000	2779000	So it's probably still.
2779000	2780000	This is still.
2780000	2783000	Ten times heavier than the average experiment.
2783000	2784000	Above.
2784000	2785000	It can even be heavier.
2785000	2786000	Okay.
2786000	2787000	Anyway.
2788000	2790000	Then I'm going to do it again.
2790000	2791000	Our work is very simple.
2791000	2792000	Is that we.
2792000	2793000	Consider the graph on the right.
2793000	2794000	On the left.
2794000	2795000	With this.
2795000	2797000	The idea is that M is multiple.
2797000	2799000	Then N is Neutron.
2799000	2800000	Then through the middle.
2801000	2802000	This action.
2802000	2803000	No border.
2803000	2804000	That.
2804000	2806000	This action and this Neutron.
2806000	2807000	The last one is.
2807000	2808000	It's easier.
2808000	2809000	Just assume there's a.
2809000	2810000	Yukai.
2810000	2811000	Yukai interaction.
2811000	2812000	You know this theory.
2812000	2813000	Right.
2813000	2814000	Yukai should be quite famous.
2814000	2815000	It's Japan.
2815000	2817000	It's a theoretical science.
2817000	2818000	Yeah.
2818000	2819000	Yeah.
2819000	2820000	What's more difficult is.
2820000	2822000	How to calculate multiple.
2822000	2823000	With this action.
2823000	2824000	This interaction.
2824000	2825000	That's it.
2825000	2826000	It's going to be.
2826000	2827000	The so-called winter effect.
2827000	2828000	That is to say.
2828000	2829000	You can imagine.
2829000	2830000	This.
2830000	2831000	Uh.
2831000	2832000	More.
2832000	2833000	More.
2833000	2834000	Uh.
2834000	2835000	How?
2835000	2836000	Because of that.
2836000	2837000	His.
2837000	2838000	If there is an action.
2838000	2839000	This charge.
2839000	2840000	It will.
2840000	2841000	It will spread in space.
2842000	2843000	In some sense.
2843000	2844000	It will.
2844000	2845000	It will affect this.
2845000	2846000	Uh.
2846000	2847000	Neutron.
2847000	2848000	For example.
2848000	2849000	If you have this.
2849000	2850000	If this is moving.
2850000	2851000	This.
2851000	2852000	Neutron.
2852000	2853000	He might feel this.
2853000	2854000	This.
2854000	2855000	This movement.
2855000	2856000	Yeah.
2856000	2857000	So.
2857000	2858000	Let's say they have an interaction.
2858000	2859000	Yeah.
2859000	2860000	Through this action.
2860000	2861000	That's pretty hard.
2861000	2862000	Because of this.
2862000	2863000	We can't just write this.
2863000	2864000	This action.
2864000	2865000	With mobile.
2865000	2866000	This interaction.
2866000	2867000	It's going to be through this.
2867000	2868000	Winter effect.
2868000	2869000	Yeah.
2869000	2870000	That's it.
2870000	2871000	Some of my boss's ideas.
2871000	2872000	Yeah.
2872000	2873000	That.
2873000	2874000	If we can calculate this.
2874000	2875000	These interactions.
2875000	2876000	What about it?
2876000	2877000	We can also calculate this process.
2877000	2878000	This color scheme.
2878000	2879000	Because you remember.
2879000	2880000	We were just in time.
2880000	2881000	You have to compare with the experiment.
2881000	2882000	That time.
2882000	2883000	They measured the color scheme.
2883000	2884000	With.
2884000	2885000	The same relationship.
2885000	2886000	Yeah.
2886000	2887000	As long as we calculate it.
2887000	2888000	You can do it.
2888000	2889000	Compare with time.
2889000	2890000	And then to our model.
2890000	2891000	Some parameters.
2891000	2892000	Constraint.
2892000	2893000	Good.
2893000	2894000	Well, since we're actually.
2894000	2896000	We also consider some other experiments.
2896000	2898000	Like the so-called experience.
2898000	2899000	Yeah.
2899000	2900000	And these.
2900000	2902000	This experiment is mainly to measure some.
2902000	2903000	More long life.
2903000	2904000	This.
2904000	2905000	Some particles.
2905000	2906000	Yeah.
2906000	2907000	That action.
2907000	2908000	It's one of the possibilities.
2908000	2909000	Yeah.
2909000	2910000	We also put this.
2910000	2911000	This time limit.
2911000	2912000	Also put it in this.
2912000	2913000	Yeah.
2913000	2914000	Analysis.
2914000	2915000	Yeah.
2915000	2916000	Okay.
2916000	2917000	There's a lot of time in this regard.
2917000	2918000	Like this.
2918000	2919000	On the left.
2919000	2920000	See this charm on the picture.
2920000	2921000	And ship.
2921000	2922000	Yeah.
2922000	2923000	And charm is already given.
2923000	2924000	Some upper bound.
2924000	2925000	Yeah.
2925000	2926000	Some restrictions.
2926000	2927000	And ship is.
2927000	2928000	Future perspective.
2928000	2929000	That's it.
2929000	2931000	There's also this FA on the picture.
2931000	2932000	FA is basically.
2932000	2933000	This.
2933000	2936000	The intensity of the interaction.
2936000	2937000	That is to say.
2938000	2939000	If you F is super big.
2939000	2941000	But this strength is weaker.
2941000	2942000	Yeah.
2942000	2943000	Yeah.
2943000	2945000	We can also see this FA.
2945000	2946000	That's this.
2946000	2948000	The strength of this action.
2948000	2949000	Probably.
2950000	2951000	It's related to this FA.
2951000	2953000	You'll see it later.
2953000	2954000	Okay.
2954000	2956000	Since this is the mother.
2956000	2957000	I'll bring it over soon.
2957000	2959000	Because this is too detailed.
2959000	2960000	I'll tell you the story.
2960000	2963000	The way to finish my theoretical computing work.
2963000	2964000	That's the same.
2964000	2965000	We have this model.
2965000	2966000	Write down this Lagrangian.
2968000	2969000	And then the last one.
2969000	2970000	What about this?
2970000	2971000	It's a constant.
2971000	2973000	Now, I'm going to do this.
2973000	2974000	Let's do it.
2974000	2976000	Promoted to a.
2976000	2977000	This one.
2977000	2978000	It's a dynamical.
2978000	2979000	The field.
2979000	2980000	Like this.
2980000	2981000	That's our action.
2983000	2984000	That's the action here.
2984000	2985000	But I'm normal.
2985000	2986000	By this FA.
2986000	2987000	That is to say.
2987000	2988000	What about this?
2988000	2989000	It's not a unit.
2989000	2990000	Yeah.
2990000	2991000	That.
2991000	2993000	Once we write down this Lagrangian.
2993000	2994000	We can solve it.
2994000	2995000	To solve this.
2995000	2996000	Motion equation.
2996000	2998000	That's the equation of motion.
2998000	2999000	That's the picture.
2999000	3000000	That's the picture.
3000000	3001000	This line below.
3001000	3002000	A little complicated.
3002000	3005000	And then we'll put in some boundary conditions.
3005000	3006000	That is to say.
3006000	3007000	We have to assume that this.
3007000	3010000	The energy of the system is limited.
3010000	3011000	It can't be infinite.
3011000	3012000	It's not going to happen.
3012000	3015000	So this action field is at the origin.
3015000	3016000	To go to zero.
3016000	3017000	And then at the same time.
3017000	3018000	It's infinite.
3018000	3019000	It's going to be.
3019000	3020000	Close to this.
3020000	3021000	A constant.
3021000	3023000	This constant is called Zeta 0.
3024000	3027000	With this equation of motion and boundary conditions.
3027000	3028000	We can solve.
3028000	3029000	Equation of motion.
3029000	3031000	Whether it's using numbers or some.
3031000	3033000	Uh, just solve it.
3035000	3036000	The picture is.
3036000	3038000	The picture is our result.
3038000	3039000	That green.
3039000	3040000	That's what.
3041000	3043000	The orange one is the result of our numbers.
3044000	3046000	Uh, that's what we're going to do.
3046000	3048000	Solve the original equation directly.
3048000	3050000	Of course, we have some mirroring.
3050000	3052000	The blue curve is the result of the number.
3052000	3053000	Then I found out that we.
3055000	3058000	The solution of the solution is very good.
3058000	3060000	Yeah, I didn't say that.
3060000	3061000	Because it's a little complicated.
3061000	3063000	Okay, so.
3063000	3065000	So you can see this action.
3066000	3068000	This, this, this distribution.
3069000	3070000	That's the picture.
3071000	3074000	It's the distance from the distance.
3074000	3076000	So the closer.
3076000	3078000	The closer to the left is the position of the model.
3078000	3079000	That's the zero part.
3080000	3081000	And then go.
3082000	3083000	To the right is.
3083000	3085000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, long distance.
3086000	3088000	So you can see when it's closer and closer.
3090000	3091000	This is this.
3092000	3094000	Well, it's not, it's not mobile.
3094000	3095000	It's the actual fuel.
3095000	3096000	The ratio of his one is getting smaller.
3096000	3098000	Well, that's kind of a simple reason.
3098000	3099000	Because I just saw.
3101000	3103000	This shop will.
3103000	3105000	The power plant will do this.
3106000	3108000	The value of this github has to do with.
3108000	3110000	So if you're getting closer and closer.
3110000	3113000	If you're far away, you're getting smaller and smaller.
3113000	3114000	You're going to send it.
3115000	3117000	Then you're going to blow up your system.
3117000	3119000	So it becomes that when you're getting closer and closer.
3119000	3120000	What about this city tower?
3120000	3121000	It's going to be close to zero.
3121000	3123000	That's how the system is going to be.
3123000	3126000	Yeah, that's the most basic reason.
3126000	3128000	So you can predict that he's somewhere.
3129000	3131000	This action, his size, he's somewhere.
3131000	3132000	To reduce.
3132000	3134000	Yeah, that's the reduction.
3134000	3135000	The location is probably.
3135000	3138000	Roughly in this part.
3139000	3140000	That's probably.
3141000	3142000	That's the one on the video.
3143000	3144000	The following definition.
3144000	3146000	Well, you don't really need to know this definition.
3146000	3147000	Why is that?
3148000	3149000	And then.
3150000	3152000	So we're basically going to end this.
3153000	3155000	The distribution of the action field near this model.
3157000	3159000	So we're going to take it as a three-dimensional interface.
3159000	3161000	That's the first one on the screen.
3161000	3163000	That's what I just said.
3163000	3164000	The action, yes.
3164000	3165000	For example, look at this one.
3165000	3167000	This is a x, a of x, which is action.
3168000	3169000	And then what's behind that?
3169000	3170000	That's the new curve.
3171000	3174000	This is a general way of doing long-term computing.
3174000	3176000	This is a familiar way of writing.
3176000	3177000	Yeah.
3177000	3178000	What about this?
3178000	3179000	Or what about the light?
3179000	3181000	We can go and calculate the probability of its color.
3181000	3183000	The color of this mp2.
3183000	3185000	Okay, so it's the shape.
3185000	3186000	Uh, his.
3186000	3189000	The result is the second line of the equation.
3189000	3191000	And then you can see that there's one in this equation.
3191000	3193000	There's a space for this x.
3193000	3194000	This kind of point.
3195000	3196000	That is to say, if we just.
3196000	3197000	We just got rid of his.
3198000	3199000	This space is distributed.
3200000	3202000	So it's natural to throw it into this point.
3202000	3203000	And then you can calculate this mp2.
3204000	3206000	And then you make the mp2 a square.
3206000	3207000	You can calculate this.
3207000	3208000	The three-color interface.
3208000	3209000	And then the result is.
3210000	3211000	The green part below, like this.
3213000	3215000	So this is the final, final, final, final theoretical calculation.
3215000	3216000	This is the result.
3216000	3217000	But after this result.
3217000	3218000	I have a question.
3218000	3219000	Okay.
3219000	3221000	My, my, my, my, actually, my question is quite general.
3221000	3222000	That is.
3222000	3226000	Ok, so you, now your monopuly charge.
3226000	3227000	And then we actually know.
3227000	3229000	Hello, the density seems to be how much.
3229000	3231000	So you can probably know.
3231000	3233000	It's your number density.
3233000	3234000	This bridge hundreds of TV.
3234000	3235000	Number density.
3235000	3236000	How much is it?
3236000	3238000	But they're all charging each other.
3238000	3243000	So.
3243000	3244000	So they can interact with each other through dark four times.
3244000	3246000	Or the repair is, you know, which is why you put together.
3246000	3249000	So you're not going to have a very strong constraint.
3249000	3252000	Is it from?
3252000	3255000	I put it in.
3255000	3258000	I'll give you a look at this.
3258000	3261000	In fact, the company has considered this.
3261000	3263000	Yeah, they're going to steal a black photon.
3263000	3265000	It's going to form, it's going to form.
3265000	3267000	What do you mean?
3267000	3269000	It's going to have a strong effect.
3269000	3271000	It's going to have a very strong effect.
3272000	3274000	Of course, we have that.
3274000	3276000	It's okay.
3276000	3278000	Yeah, okay, interesting.
3278000	3280000	Okay, thank you.
3280000	3282000	No, I didn't say too much.
3282000	3283000	So there is.
3283000	3285000	Good.
3285000	3287000	Anyway, it's very mathematical here.
3287000	3289000	That's it.
3289000	3290000	That's it.
3290000	3292000	I just finished talking about it.
3292000	3294000	It's just more technical stuff.
3294000	3296000	Okay, so we're going to figure out the result.
3296000	3297000	It's a three-color interface.
3297000	3300000	I just said that time is to look at the relationship between the three-color interface and the value.
3300000	3303000	Okay, so that's the result.
3303000	3305000	And I'm going to give you two examples here.
3305000	3307000	I'm going to pick two.
3307000	3309000	Okay, that's basically what I just did.
3309000	3311000	I just don't have that.
3311000	3314000	This one.
3314000	3316000	Yeah, this one.
3316000	3318000	His signature is F.A.
3318000	3320000	And then the horizontal axis is X.
3320000	3321000	That's the same.
3321000	3323000	You can look at this green one.
3323000	3325000	Do you happen to have these parameters?
3325000	3327000	Well, basically, there's no parameter that needs to be adjusted.
3327000	3328000	For example.
3328000	3330000	Uh.
3330000	3331000	Alpha H.
3331000	3333000	We've just been given the benchmark point.
3333000	3335000	And then M.N. is the value of the box.
3335000	3338000	We know that the box is about 1G.
3338000	3340000	And then C.T.A.0 is a parameter.
3340000	3341000	And then C.T.A.
3341000	3342000	C.T.A.N.
3342000	3345000	C.N. is probably some theoretical data.
3345000	3347000	Calculate it like this.
3347000	3348000	So we don't have a lot of parameters.
3348000	3349000	In this model.
3349000	3350000	Okay.
3350000	3352000	And then we can see the result.
3352000	3353000	So we're the same.
3353000	3355000	The horizontal axis is F.A.
3355000	3357000	And then the horizontal axis is X.
3357000	3359000	And then we pick two benchmark points.
3359000	3362000	And then the red and green on the graph.
3362000	3364000	There's already a time limit.
3364000	3366000	So I'm going to use the first one.
3366000	3367000	I'm going to use the first one.
3367000	3370000	And then the blue one is going to be in the future.
3370000	3371000	It's Pico 500.
3371000	3372000	It's the same.
3372000	3373000	It's the same.
3373000	3374000	It's the time of a dark matter.
3374000	3377000	It's going to be measured in the future.
3377000	3378000	That's it.
3378000	3381000	So you can see that this is about the size of F.A.
3381000	3383000	It's about 10 to the 7th square.
3383000	3384000	That's it.
3384000	3387000	Okay, so it's almost time.
3387000	3388000	It's about to upgrade.
3388000	3390000	Just a little bit about this.
3390000	3391000	It's pretty simple.
3391000	3393000	It's just preparing a pro.
3393000	3394000	Uh, a pro.
3394000	3396000	Or some experiments are done with Electron.
3396000	3398000	And then he's using Proton.
3398000	3399000	And then he's going to turn a target.
3399000	3402000	And then there's some reaction in this target.
3402000	3404000	And then there's a lot of these.
3404000	3405000	Some of these rings.
3405000	3408000	And then these rings might be able to get to a lot of.
3408000	3410000	I don't know about these unknown particles.
3410000	3411000	Maybe it's the action.
3411000	3412000	That's the action.
3412000	3414000	He might not be stable.
3414000	3417000	He might be in.
3417000	3419000	He's changed before he got to the tag.
3419000	3421000	Or to say.
3421000	3422000	It's changing after you leave.
3422000	3425000	Yeah, well, there's a possibility that he's changing inside the tag.
3425000	3427000	And then it might change into light.
3427000	3428000	Ah, electricity.
3428000	3429000	Ah, aim.
3429000	3430000	Then, of course, we're on the model side.
3430000	3433000	This light will change to Hilton Photon.
3433000	3435000	Yeah, that's the one down there.
3435000	3436000	Equation is this.
3436000	3438000	We should have to predict how many events we should see.
3438000	3439000	Yeah.
3439000	3442000	That's the only thing I'm going to change.
3442000	3443000	It's very simple to say.
3443000	3444000	Of course, it's a test.
3444000	3445000	You can see the particle.
3445000	3448000	It's like light, aim, or electricity.
3448000	3450000	Hidden Photon is invisible.
3450000	3451000	But because there's a hidden.
3451000	3453000	Because it's a hidden Photon.
3453000	3455000	So it's going to reduce.
3455000	3459000	Action to the probability of visible particles.
3459000	3461000	Yeah, so it's going to be.
3461000	3462000	Uh, it's going to be diluted.
3462000	3465000	So it's going to be a little bit weaker.
3465000	3467000	And then it's like, uh.
3467000	3469000	I'm going to show you this.
3469000	3471000	Like the one on the left.
3471000	3472000	You'll find that.
3473000	3474000	That Alpha H is zero.
3474000	3476000	Alpha H means there's no Hilton Photon.
3476000	3477000	It's just.
3478000	3480000	It's none of my business.
3480000	3481000	Constraint.
3481000	3482000	It's black.
3482000	3483000	The black part.
3483000	3485000	But if you have an introduction of Hilton Photon.
3485000	3486000	Then you'll find that this.
3486000	3488000	Constraint will be.
3488000	3489000	It's going to be weak.
3489000	3490000	It's going to shrink.
3490000	3492000	It's going to shrink.
3492000	3494000	Because there's a new channel.
3495000	3496000	Yeah, that's Trump.
3496000	3498000	And then the left and right is the future.
3498000	3499000	Yeah, we're the same.
3499000	3501000	Consider some of the same.
3501000	3503000	Uh, the possibility of Alpha H.
3503000	3506000	So we just had the result of the bin.
3506000	3507000	And then we have this.
3507000	3511000	Uh, the result of the direct observation.
3511000	3512000	And the result of the bin.
3512000	3514000	So we can simply combine them together.
3514000	3516000	Okay, so this is our final result.
3517000	3519000	Of course, it's a little complicated.
3519000	3521000	But let's take a look at the picture.
3522000	3523000	Back.
3523000	3525000	That's what the color counter is.
3525000	3526000	That's what the back color.
3526000	3528000	Shadow part is.
3528000	3530000	It's been excluded so far.
3531000	3532000	That's the only white part.
3532000	3533000	It's still allowed at the moment.
3534000	3538000	That's about about ten to the fourth.
3538000	3540000	Uh, ten to the fifth.
3540000	3542000	And it's about ten mv.
3542000	3543000	It's just around here.
3543000	3544000	This is the pin.
3544000	3545000	With this.
3546000	3548000	With this, uh, direct measurement.
3548000	3550000	There's an overlap.
3550000	3552000	Well, of course, we can say that in the future.
3552000	3553000	Maybe in this range.
3553000	3555000	To detect this model.
3555000	3557000	It's still value like this.
3557000	3559000	Okay, so this is our final result.
3559000	3562000	Okay, so I'm going to summarize it.
3562000	3565000	Uh, our research project is simply to study.
3565000	3566000	Uh, hidden motor.
3566000	3567000	Hidden motor and.
3568000	3570000	The nuclear, uh, through this action.
3570000	3571000	Uh, interaction.
3571000	3573000	And then we're going to calculate its three-color interface.
3573000	3575000	And then compare it with the experiment.
3575000	3577000	And then I found about two.
3577000	3580000	Two parameters space, it may be in the future.
3580000	3584000	This dark matter experiment and this ice cream experiment.
3584000	3586000	Uh, do the test.
3586000	3588000	Okay, so this is my speech today.
3588000	3589000	Thank you all.
3591000	3594000	Okay, so now I'd like to ask you to turn on the microphone.
3594000	3596000	So that we can hear our applause.
3596000	3598000	So let's give it up.
3598000	3600000	Thank you for your wonderful speech.
3607000	3608000	Um, okay.
3608000	3610000	Does anyone have any questions?
3612000	3613000	Uh, I have a question.
3613000	3614000	How do you decide this?
3614000	3616000	Uh, your input parameters.
3616000	3619000	Like, uh, and, uh, and, uh.
3619000	3620000	Oh, okay.
3620000	3621000	Okay.
3624000	3625000	It's just that.
3625000	3626000	For example, this side.
3626000	3627000	Oh, my God.
3627000	3628000	This is.
3630000	3631000	This one, this one.
3633000	3634000	Why is it?
3634000	3635000	That is, we can.
3635000	3636000	I just said we can estimate.
3637000	3638000	This dark matter.
3638000	3640000	Uh, this number density.
3640000	3641000	Right?
3642000	3644000	That's what I just said on the side of the photo.
3644000	3645000	A little bit.
3645000	3646000	Theoretical work.
3646000	3649000	Theoretically, we can estimate the number density of the dark matter.
3650000	3651000	And then we know it again.
3651000	3653000	Can we know its quality?
3654000	3655000	This is mn.
3655000	3657000	This is your mn times.
3657000	3659000	Your value times number density is.
3659000	3661000	Mass density.
3662000	3664000	That mass density will tell you.
3664000	3666000	How much of this dark matter should be in the universe?
3666000	3667000	This one.
3667000	3668000	How many potions?
3668000	3669000	Well, I just said at the beginning.
3669000	3670000	Dark matter.
3670000	3671000	He should be in the universe.
3671000	3672000	Uh.
3673000	3674000	One quarter of it.
3675000	3676000	So it becomes you.
3676000	3677000	You have a very strong limit.
3677000	3678000	So it's called fit.
3678000	3679000	That one.
3679000	3680000	This 25% of the words.
3680000	3681000	Your number.
3681000	3682000	Your alpha h and mn.
3683000	3684000	Can be fixed.
3686000	3687000	But the result of theory.
3688000	3689000	I see.
3689000	3690000	So in this model.
3690000	3692000	Exxon is not dark matter.
3692000	3693000	He is not.
3693000	3694000	But I know.
3694000	3695000	I know.
3695000	3696000	You also know that many people use.
3696000	3697000	Exxon is dark matter.
3697000	3698000	That side.
3698000	3700000	We mainly treat Exxon as a medium.
3700000	3702000	He will treat it as dark matter.
3703000	3704000	It can also be.
3704000	3705000	But his contribution should be very small.
3706000	3707000	It's almost negligible.
3707000	3708000	Compared to this.
3716000	3717000	Actually, I have one.
3717000	3718000	I have a similar.
3718000	3719000	The problem is.
3719000	3720000	So, okay.
3720000	3721000	So your halo is basically.
3721000	3722000	Or whatever.
3722000	3723000	Anyway, your.
3723000	3724000	That one.
3724000	3725000	Dark matter is monopole.
3726000	3727000	But he will still.
3728000	3729000	Couple Exxon.
3729000	3730000	That.
3730000	3731000	If today.
3731000	3732000	Really in.
3732000	3733000	For example, that kind of.
3733000	3735000	He has a very strong magnetic field.
3735000	3736000	Then he can.
3736000	3737000	It's like putting that.
3737000	3738000	Vacuum.
3738000	3739000	Exxon.
3739000	3740000	Is playing out.
3740000	3741000	A photon can resonate.
3741000	3742000	But such an effect.
3742000	3743000	Can it happen to you?
3743000	3744000	This model.
3744000	3745000	Just those side.
3745000	3746000	Exxon.
3746000	3747000	That you.
3747000	3748000	Here, because I'm here.
3748000	3749000	I'm actually not relying on the photon.
3749000	3750000	It's not a general photon.
3750000	3751000	It should.
3751000	3752000	It should be said that there is a couple.
3752000	3753000	But it should be.
3753000	3754000	Wait a minute.
3754000	3755000	Strength.
3755000	3756000	You see.
3756000	3757000	Through the general action.
3757000	3758000	With the photon.
3758000	3759000	That.
3759000	3760000	That.
3760000	3761000	That.
3761000	3762000	And then through that.
3762000	3763000	That.
3763000	3764000	That.
3764000	3765000	That.
3765000	3766000	That.
3766000	3767000	That.
3767000	3768000	That.
3768000	3769820	That's a very strong electrical field.
3769820	3772820	Then to generate exxon is not.
3772820	3773820	To be honest.
3773820	3774820	Yes, it is.
3774820	3775820	It's through a loop.
3775820	3776960	Then it becomes.
3776960	3778880	If you give him a photon.
3778880	3779880	Then it is.
3779880	3780880	Then you it through a loop.
3780880	3781880	Then it becomes a.
3781880	3783380	Uh, what is this.
3783380	3784380	It's a normal photon.
3784380	3785380	It's not a dark photon.
3785380	3786380	Yes, that's what it is.
3786380	3787380	I want to.
3787380	3788380	I want to have constraint.
3788380	3789380	But because of my action is.
3789380	3790380	It should be very.
3790380	3791380	You see, I'm actually quite heavy.
3791380	3792380	Your impression.
3792380	3793380	I see.
3793380	3794380	So, if you do.
3794380	3795380	So, because I'm actually quite heavy.
3795380	3796380	So, if you do.
3796760	3797760	Without using.
3797760	3798760	Oh, so you came out.
3798760	3799760	It's not even.
3799760	3800760	You come out.
3800760	3801760	It's a super.
3801760	3802760	That doesn't mean.
3802760	3803760	Ha ha ha ha ha.
3803760	3804760	I see I see.
3804760	3805240	OK.
3805240	3806240	Then everyone has a question?
3806240	3807240	Why don't you consider others?
3807240	3808240	Why didn't you consider others?
3808240	3809240	direct.
3809240	3810240	That.
3810240	3811240	This article is a.
3811240	3812240	Recreational learning field.
3812240	3813240	After the Selena Gavin memo like this.
3813240	3814240	Why don't you consider others?
3814240	3815240	direct.
3815240	3816240	Uh, that Darkmatt'lll also have time to say.
3816240	3817240	Can, can I.
3817240	3818240	Everyone, see you like me.
3818240	3819240	It's says I have this mother to.
3819240	3822080	It's said that this fact is then.
3822080	3823080	It's fixed.
3823080	3824980	Spin dependent right.
3825080	3826080	This is the first one.
3826080	3827080	Then there is.
3827080	3828080	We, we, of course, pick.
3828080	3829080	We, of course, pick this concentrate.
3829080	3830080	The strongest is probably.
3830080	3831080	I'm probably here.
3831080	3832080	I'm kidding.
3832080	3833080	Why spin dependent?
3833080	3834080	This, I'm a little bit missed.
3834080	3835080	Uh, actually, I didn't explain it.
3835080	3836080	But.
3836080	3837080	Let's put it this way.
3837080	3838080	This is more technical.
3838080	3839080	That is to say.
3839080	3840080	You see this equation.
3840080	3841080	This is the result.
3841080	3842080	If you're more familiar.
3842080	3843080	If you're more familiar with theory, you'll find out.
3843080	3844080	You find this section.
3844080	3845080	It's a bit of this.
3845080	3846080	Transfer momentum.
3846080	3847080	So, if you're more familiar with the theory.
3847080	3848080	You'll find that this section.
3848080	3849080	It's a bit of this.
3849080	3850080	It's a bit of this.
3850080	3851080	Transfer momentum.
3881180	3882180	Transfer momentum.
3887180	3888180	What did he say?
3891180	3892180	So, anyway.
3893380	3893380	
3893380	3896380	This momentum dependence.
3896380	3898380	Connection is generally spin level.
3898380	3903380	Yes, we have to consider this from the side.
3904180	3906180	So, so what you mean is.
3906180	3908180	Anyway, in general.
3908180	3910180	The result you calculated depends on spin level.
3910280	3913280	This is not an assumption or something you can decide first.
3913280	3914280	Is that right?
3914280	3916280	It should be said that we have this result.
3916280	3917280	We can.
3917280	3918280	Obviously, this result tells you.
3918280	3920280	It depends on this transfer momentum.
3920280	3922280	So it depends on spin.
3922280	3924280	Then we can find some.
3924280	3925280	Effect operator.
3926280	3927280	They.
3928280	3932280	The result they calculated is also spin dependent.
3932280	3934280	Then at the same time it depends on this transfer momentum.
3935280	3937280	Then we use its result to confirm this parameter.
3937380	3940380	But it doesn't mean that the transfer momentum has spin or something.
3943380	3946380	If it is spin independent.
3946380	3948380	You can also set some constraints, right?
3958380	3961380	You don't have to have spin.
3961380	3962380	Because.
3964380	3965380	Because it depends on momentum.
3965380	3966380	So.
3967380	3969380	Generally, spin independent seems.
3969380	3971380	It should be weaker.
3971380	3973380	You just said it's the next level.
3973380	3975380	This is a bit like.
3975380	3977380	This independent should have a leading order.
3977380	3978380	Is.
3978380	3979380	What is it?
3979380	3981380	Leading order and sub-leading order.
3981380	3984380	This kind of spin dependent should have very little contribution.
3989380	3991380	It's kind of S-wave, P-wave.
3992380	3993380	Very similar feeling.
3993480	3994480	In fact, I have a slide.
3994480	3996480	I talked about it in Dongda before.
3996480	3998480	I don't want to talk about this detail.
3998480	3999480	Let me see.
4000480	4002480	I talked about it in Dongda.
4002480	4004480	You can take a look.
4005480	4007480	Of course, there was more detail at that time.
4011480	4013480	For example, we have to consider this.
4015480	4016480	This effect operator.
4018480	4019480	Then obviously you see this effect.
4019480	4021480	Starting from this effect operator.
4021580	4023580	Now, for example, on this screen.
4023580	4025580	This Psi is the document.
4025580	4026580	Then Psi n is the new curve.
4026580	4028580	Then through this effect operator.
4028580	4029580	We can calculate its amplitude.
4029580	4031580	Then you can see that the amplitude depends on this.
4031580	4032580	This spin.
4032580	4034580	For example, that sigma is polymetric.
4034580	4036580	For example, this kind of thing is.
4038580	4039580	Spin dependent.
4039580	4040580	Then there is the same amplitude.
4040580	4042580	You can calculate its cross-section.
4042580	4044580	Then someone has already done this analysis.
4044580	4046580	So basically, I just put this equation.
4046580	4048580	For example, this yellow one.
4048680	4049680	The final result.
4050680	4052680	Then equal to the result we just calculated.
4052680	4054680	Then do the comparison like this.
4056680	4058680	So to be honest, we are a bit like.
4058680	4060680	Use other constraints to constrain our parameters.
4060680	4062680	We did not directly.
4062680	4064680	For example, you may want to do some.
4064680	4066680	More complicated calculations.
4066680	4068680	Because we haven't scored this cross-section yet.
4069680	4071680	We still have to consider some.
4071680	4073680	Neutron.
4075680	4077680	Recurrence.
4077780	4079780	Recurrence.
4081780	4083780	But I didn't really do a deep analysis.
4083780	4085780	We just put people's results.
4085780	4087780	To constrain.
4087780	4089780	This is someone else's upper bound.
4089780	4091780	We can just extract it.
4093780	4095780	I will ask this question because.
4095780	4097780	Axiom interaction is not limited to.
4097780	4099780	Spin dependent cross-section.
4099780	4101780	You can go straight to many experiments.
4101780	4103780	Measure the axiom.
4103780	4105780	Axiom can be absorbed.
4105880	4107880	So if you just look at.
4107880	4109880	The Fermi diagram.
4111880	4113880	You can consider.
4113880	4115880	Axiom is absorbed by your detector.
4115880	4117880	So you can use xenon.
4117880	4119880	Or LZ to measure.
4119880	4121880	That's right.
4125880	4127880	Are you measuring the axiom now?
4129880	4131880	Because you have to go through the axiom.
4131880	4133880	To measure your monopole.
4133980	4135980	Right?
4137980	4139980	Because it is a medium.
4139980	4141980	So.
4141980	4143980	So you go to your Fermi diagram.
4143980	4145980	Your left side of the Fermi diagram.
4145980	4147980	Monopole and axiom coupling.
4147980	4149980	Your right side is the axiom.
4149980	4151980	Coupling with Fibre.
4151980	4153980	Any coupling between the axiom and your detector.
4155980	4157980	So basically I think.
4157980	4159980	You should also have.
4159980	4161980	You can use other bigger detectors to measure.
4163980	4165980	Because they have already done.
4165980	4167980	A lot of axiom measurements.
4171980	4173980	But I don't know about the mass range.
4173980	4175980	Except for Bindan.
4177980	4179980	If you have this theory.
4179980	4181980	Other experiments can also do.
4181980	4183980	High energy axiom measurements.
4183980	4185980	They just don't have a good theory.
4185980	4187980	The reason is because the axiom is so high.
4187980	4189980	This high mass region.
4189980	4191980	His lifetime is very short.
4192080	4194080	So it can't be a dark matter.
4194080	4196080	Right.
4196080	4198080	So these direct dark matter experiments.
4198080	4200080	They won't consider.
4200080	4202080	This kind of axiom.
4202080	4204080	He will only consider KEV's axiom.
4204080	4206080	He won't consider.
4206080	4208080	GEV or NEV's axiom.
4208080	4210080	But if you set up this model.
4210080	4212080	They can consider GEV's axiom.
4212080	4214080	Because your axiom is not dark matter.
4214080	4216080	It's your monopole that's dark matter.
4216180	4218180	Yeah.
4218180	4220180	But I don't know what you just said.
4220180	4222180	Experiment.
4222180	4224180	LZ can be.
4224180	4226180	Unlox or Xenon.
4226180	4228180	They all have a lot of.
4228180	4230180	Bosonic dark matter measurement.
4230180	4232180	Basically.
4232180	4234180	Axiom in KEV to 100 KEV.
4234180	4236180	This range.
4236180	4238180	You can imagine the axiom.
4238180	4240180	Detected absorbed.
4240180	4242180	Just like the photon.
4242180	4244180	Then you can use this.
4244280	4246280	Then you can use this to consider the axiom.
4246280	4248280	That.
4248280	4250280	In the KEV range.
4250280	4252280	What about your model?
4252280	4254280	Basically, you can also consider the axiom.
4254280	4256280	NEV or GEV range.
4256280	4258280	It was absorbed by your detector.
4258280	4260280	Uh-huh.
4260280	4262280	Of course they may.
4262280	4264280	Their detector may have energy.
4264280	4266280	Threshold may not be able to GEV.
4266280	4268280	Maybe a few NEV.
4268280	4270280	I guess.
4270280	4272280	So maybe in this.
4272380	4274380	Maybe on the left side of your picture.
4274380	4276380	This place can be set up.
4276380	4278380	Uplimit.
4278380	4280380	Are you on the left side of the picture?
4280380	4282380	There are many NEV parts.
4282380	4284380	This is about 10 NEV range.
4286380	4288380	But there are other things here.
4288380	4290380	I didn't just say that.
4290380	4292380	Yes, there may be other things.
4292380	4294380	So I don't know.
4294380	4296380	Is it other.
4296380	4298380	These large dark matter experiments.
4298380	4300380	Can also be done.
4300480	4302480	What about the region on the left side of your picture?
4302480	4304480	Because I don't know.
4304480	4306480	Where is their energy threshold?
4306480	4308480	I am doing low mass.
4308480	4310480	But.
4310480	4312480	But I look at this picture.
4312480	4314480	I think it's actually a bit like.
4314480	4316480	High mass experiment.
4316480	4318480	Want to do low mass.
4318480	4320480	The place is probably on the right.
4320480	4322480	They can do a few GEV now.
4322480	4324480	Then do a low mass.
4324480	4326480	Just do it.
4326480	4328480	So in fact, I think this one.
4328580	4330580	A lot of people want to.
4330580	4332580	There are a lot of direct experiments.
4332580	4334580	You are not the same.
4334580	4336580	This is Exxon, not WIMP.
4336580	4338580	WIMP in GEV is low mass.
4338580	4340580	But in Exxon, GEV is high mass.
4342580	4344580	No, I'm talking about it now.
4344580	4346580	In general, if you can.
4346580	4348580	For example, you can couple to a.
4348580	4350580	U1 Bosonic dark matter.
4350580	4352580	So it actually includes this side.
4352580	4354580	So I think it can.
4354580	4356580	For example, if today.
4356680	4358680	They consider.
4358680	4360680	You can be in Xenon.
4360680	4362680	For example.
4362680	4364680	Analyzation signal.
4364680	4366680	Direct absorption.
4366680	4368680	They should be able to do 0.
4368680	4370680	It's 10 to 0 to 10 to 1.
4370680	4372680	If today is.
4372680	4374680	If it's a solid detector.
4374680	4376680	I think I can do it again.
4376680	4378680	So in fact, this picture is a big piece.
4378680	4380680	There should be data to look at.
4380680	4382680	So it's possible to see.
4382680	4384680	So you might have new concerns here.
4384780	4386780	If you consider those.
4388780	4390780	Giant dark matter experiment.
4392780	4394780	I'll take a look.
4396780	4398780	Tell me about it later.
4398780	4400780	I'm actually doing a little analysis here.
4402780	4404780	Because we're doing Marana now.
4404780	4406780	We're thinking about whether we can do this.
4406780	4408780	NEV Exxon experiment.
4408780	4410780	Measurement.
4410880	4412880	Because in general.
4412880	4414880	Exxon in NEV.
4414880	4416880	Lifetime is very short.
4416880	4418880	So Exxon can't be dark matter.
4418880	4420880	But if you are.
4420880	4422880	There is a dark sector.
4422880	4424880	Or a forever thing.
4424880	4426880	Through Exxon couple to your detector.
4426880	4428880	Then you.
4428880	4430880	Exxon's lifetime can be very short.
4432880	4434880	So in theory, you can set a constraint there.
4434980	4436980	That's it.
4440980	4442980	Sorry.
4442980	4444980	Do you have any other questions?
4444980	4446980	I think we.
4446980	4448980	If you want to discuss it later.
4448980	4450980	But do you have any other questions?
4450980	4452980	If not.
4452980	4454980	Let's applaud again.
4454980	4456980	Thank you.
4458980	4460980	Thank you all.
4460980	4462980	That's it for today.
4463080	4465080	That's it for today.
4465080	4467080	That's it for today.
