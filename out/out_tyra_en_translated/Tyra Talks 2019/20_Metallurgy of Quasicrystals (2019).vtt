00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taiwan Radar Talk.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.920
I am today's host, Shi-An Hong.

00:07.920 --> 00:11.200
I am currently a post-doctoral student at the University of Michigan.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.240
Today's speaker is Dr. Hwang Chung-Ren.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.400
He is currently a post-doctoral student at the University of Tokyo, Japan,

00:18.400 --> 00:26.960
and the Japan Research Institute for Human Materials and Materials.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.840
His research focuses on the application of crystalline materials and their structural characteristics.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.480
This is his main interest.

00:36.480 --> 00:42.320
It seems like you are about to get your Ph.D.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.320
Yes, I am a bit busy recently.

00:44.320 --> 00:49.680
Today's topic is the metallurgy of quasicrystals.

00:49.680 --> 00:56.400
So let's welcome Dr. Chung-Ren to give us a speech.

00:56.400 --> 01:05.680
Before we start, please remember to turn on your microphones so that the speaker can hear you.

01:05.680 --> 01:11.280
So let's give him a round of applause and let the speaker begin.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.280
Please remember to turn on your microphones.

01:19.920 --> 01:24.560
If we have any questions, can we interrupt you, Dr. Chung-Ren?

01:24.720 --> 01:26.720
Sure, no problem.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.720
I didn't prepare a good presentation today, so there might be some points that are not clear.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.720
You are welcome to interrupt.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.760
Okay, let's give Dr. Chung-Ren the microphone.

01:37.520 --> 01:42.400
Okay, first of all, thank you for the introduction.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.400
We have known each other for about a year, right?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.400
I think so. I've been a bit lazy lately.

01:46.400 --> 01:52.400
So what I'm going to talk about today is the metallurgy of quasicrystals.

01:52.480 --> 02:08.400
As you all know, in 2011, Dr. Dan Shepman discovered that he had won the Nobel Prize for violating the principles of traditional quasicrystals.

02:08.400 --> 02:16.400
So today I'm going to focus on the difference between quasicrystals and ordinary crystals.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.400
And why they are called the third state of solid matter.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.400
First of all, this is the first picture.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.400
As you can see, it's actually not a flower.

02:24.400 --> 02:34.400
When Dr. Dan Shepman discovered quasicrystals, he was in a quickly solidified aluminum alloy.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.400
But this thing was actually a big challenge at the time.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.400
Because this thing is not a stable quasicrystal.

02:42.400 --> 02:48.400
So this flower is what happens when it produces quasicrystals.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.400
At a low temperature, it will suck out a second phase.

02:52.400 --> 02:58.400
At that time, Linus Pauling also challenged Dr. Dan Shepman because of this.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.400
He said that there is no quasicrystals in this world, only Poseidon.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.400
So you can see that this is actually the original picture.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.400
This is a picture taken by a general SEM.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
And then it became like this after mapping.

03:10.400 --> 03:14.400
The reason why quasicrystals attract me so much is because it is really beautiful.

03:16.400 --> 03:24.400
As I just said, when Dan Shepman discovered quasicrystals, he was actually an Italian.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.400
He found that quasicrystals were actually discovered when he was doing sabbatical at NIST.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.400
In fact, he was very excited when he found this thing.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.400
Why does this kind of quasicrystals appear symmetrically?

03:36.400 --> 03:40.400
You can see this picture below.

03:40.400 --> 03:52.400
Someone used the aluminum-palladium-manganese alloy to make a STM picture of potential energy.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.400
We can see that it is really beautiful.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.400
And then you can see this pentagonal thing everywhere.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.400
This is when Dan Shepman was analyzing the structure of quasicrystals.

04:02.400 --> 04:08.400
He is a very famous thermo-mechanical master at NIST Sabbatical and John Kahn.

04:08.400 --> 04:14.400
But in fact, why can quasicrystals win the Nobel Prize?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.400
I really want to commemorate my boss.

04:16.400 --> 04:24.400
Unfortunately, he did not participate in our quasicrystals seminar this year because he was not in good health.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.400
He died instantly when he was on a business trip to Taiwan.

04:26.400 --> 04:42.400
Mr. Kahn's two most important contributions to quasicrystals were that he synthesized a thermo-mechanical stable quasicrystals in 1987.

04:42.400 --> 04:50.400
The synthesis of this thing led to the continued development of quasicrystals that have been around for more than 30 years.

04:50.400 --> 04:56.400
His second most important contribution was that he successfully produced a two-dimensional crystallography in 2000.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.400
What is so special about this two-dimensional crystallography?

05:00.400 --> 05:04.400
It can replace a lot of atoms in real space.

05:04.400 --> 05:10.400
This allows them to better observe the structure of the crystallography and make a more detailed real-space analysis.

05:10.400 --> 05:16.400
We actually have a workshop in Japan for quasicrystals.

05:17.400 --> 05:22.400
Everyone calls Mr. Kahn a god's hand.

05:22.400 --> 05:32.400
Because many stable quasicrystals have been synthesized by Mr. Kahn according to the rules of his doctoral class.

05:33.400 --> 05:51.400
Mr. Kahn's most important contribution was that he successfully analyzed 12 kinds of quasicrystals related to the 5-axis 20-dimensional system when he was an assistant professor in Northeast Asia.

05:51.400 --> 05:57.400
This is my outline today. I will briefly introduce what quasicrystals are and what quasicrystals are.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.400
How are quasicrystals discovered? Why are they quasicrystals? How do we define quasicrystals?

06:02.400 --> 06:08.400
Why can quasicrystals be stable? I will also briefly introduce the nature and current development of quasicrystals.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.400
I hope that today's speech will allow more people to join the research field of quasicrystals.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.400
I think it's beautiful, but many people may find it useless.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.400
First, let's talk about quasicrystals.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.400
Actually, I want to skip this part.

06:23.400 --> 06:30.400
Because I think everyone should have a basic common sense that quasicrystals must comply with Bragg's Law in quantum mechanics.

06:30.400 --> 06:36.400
But when we look at the electromagnetic microscope, there are two electromagnetic microscopes here.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
I'm so bad at talking like this.

06:38.400 --> 06:45.400
Anyway, in the case of 200kV, the lambda is very, very small.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.400
Then we can see...

06:47.400 --> 06:50.400
Oh, it's broken.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.400
Then we usually have an input wave here when we are radiating.

06:54.400 --> 07:00.400
It can be an electromagnetic wave, an X-ray, a medium-wave, a sum-house, anything.

07:00.400 --> 07:05.400
When we are radiating, it must be in line with the number of lambda.

07:05.400 --> 07:10.400
This is a very basic high school physics.

07:10.400 --> 07:15.400
But when we are radiating with an electromagnetic microscope, the input angle is very, very small.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.400
And at this time, it will produce a sphere.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.400
Because the radius of this sphere is very, very large, it can be regarded as a plane.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.400
So we can project its wave onto a plane.

07:26.400 --> 07:37.400
When its lambda value is less than d, sinθ can be close to c.

07:37.400 --> 07:44.400
This is the low value when we are at the bottom.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.400
This is a wave length of electromagnetic when we are at 200kV.

07:48.400 --> 07:56.400
This sinθ angle can be regarded as a distance from this origin to any location.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.400
According to this relationship, we call this thing the Euclidean space.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.400
Why is it called the Euclidean space?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
It is a completely opposite space.

08:04.400 --> 08:09.400
If the radius of these two planes is d, there will be a d star here.

08:09.400 --> 08:14.400
If we define this position, this big d is equal to 2π.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.400
There is a big d star here, which is in this position.

08:17.400 --> 08:23.400
It's obviously longer, but it's a little bit farther away.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
That's about it.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.400
Next is the difference between crystal and non-crystal.

08:29.400 --> 08:34.400
This should be the non-crystalline matter at the beginning of the definition.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
The crystal is obvious.

08:37.400 --> 08:42.400
When we know its position, it has some very standard surfaces.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.400
But in the crystal, we see that it is completely messy.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.400
It may have an average spread.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.400
When we sum up the definition of Bragg,

08:51.400 --> 08:55.400
we can get a crystal with a very obvious spot.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.400
We call it the color spot.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.400
But in the case of amorphous,

08:59.400 --> 09:00.400
in the case of non-crystalline,

09:00.400 --> 09:03.400
it may show some ring-shaped spots.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.400
Next is,

09:09.400 --> 09:11.400
if we list different atoms,

09:11.400 --> 09:15.400
what should it look like in the Euclidean space?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.400
We see that no matter where it is cut,

09:19.400 --> 09:23.400
its position is the same width.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.400
When we surround it,

09:24.400 --> 09:28.400
we may find that the arrangement of the crystal

09:28.400 --> 09:34.400
is very similar to that of the electron-surrounding group.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
But here,

09:35.400 --> 09:38.400
the above picture is a square.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
You may not see any difference here.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.400
It's all very obvious,

09:41.400 --> 09:43.400
almost the same geometric shape.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
But at the bottom,

09:45.400 --> 09:46.400
you will see that

09:46.400 --> 09:50.400
this is the arrangement of the crystal.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.400
Here, it's a hexagonal arrangement like this.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.400
But here, it turns 90 degrees.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.400
This is related to how to build a Euclidean space.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
I don't want to talk about it today.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
The most important thing is to talk about

10:04.400 --> 10:08.400
the periodicity of the arrangement of atoms.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
We can find a unit

10:10.400 --> 10:12.400
that can exist at the same time

10:12.400 --> 10:17.400
in its electron-surrounding group.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.400
If we want to meet this condition,

10:20.400 --> 10:23.400
there are two more important features.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
I forgot this thing.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.400
Anyway, we will find the same geometric shape

10:29.400 --> 10:33.400
in the Euclidean space as in the Euclidean space.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.400
In the crystal,

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
when we know an atom,

10:39.400 --> 10:40.400
as I just mentioned,

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
when we know where an atom is,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
we can infinitely deduce

10:44.400 --> 10:46.400
where the atom exists.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
Because the periodicity of each place is the same.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
I drew a line.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.400
I can continue to extend it.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
Of course, these constraints

10:55.400 --> 10:57.400
and geometric shapes are imagined

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
to make it easier for us to identify some things.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.400
Then it will slowly extend, extend, extend, extend.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.400
In other words,

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
knowing a place,

11:04.400 --> 11:06.400
we can know all the places.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.400
We can describe

11:08.400 --> 11:10.400
all the positions in the actual space.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
The second is

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
that if we only use one unit

11:16.400 --> 11:17.400
to fill it,

11:17.400 --> 11:19.400
like this place is square,

11:19.400 --> 11:21.400
it must meet this.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.400
I turned 90 degrees,

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
turned 90 degrees,

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
turned 90 degrees,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.400
it's still the same.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.400
It may not be so clear here,

11:29.400 --> 11:32.400
so I open another one.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
Can you see it?

11:37.400 --> 11:38.400
OK? OK.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.400
Suppose we turn now

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
to this triple axis.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.400
This is a cubic structure.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
This is a cubic structure.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
This is a L1-2 face structure.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.400
Then we turn it to the triple axis.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.400
We find that the light color is at the bottom,

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
and the dark color is at the top.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.400
Can you tell?

11:56.400 --> 11:57.400
This color is yellow.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
No, light blue.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
Lighter.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.400
Then we follow it at this time.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
This should be the triple axis.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
So when we turn 60 degrees,

12:09.400 --> 12:10.400
we will find

12:13.400 --> 12:14.400
pay attention to this position.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.400
It will be light, dark, light, dark, light.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
When we turn 120 degrees,

12:24.400 --> 12:27.400
it will be the same color moving.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
This is a symmetrical relationship.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.400
It's the same when we turn to the double axis.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
If we turn to the double axis,

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
we use 120 degrees to turn it.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.400
It's a mess.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.400
Use 90 degrees to turn it.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.400
It will run back and forth.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.400
This is a state

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
that we have to find that it meets

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
the whole symmetrical axis.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
So if we can only use

13:04.400 --> 13:05.400
one shape to arrange,

13:05.400 --> 13:06.400
we can see

13:07.400 --> 13:08.400
that if we only consider

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
each unit is square,

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
or we consider a rectangle,

13:11.400 --> 13:12.400
or we consider a rectangle,

13:12.400 --> 13:13.400
these things can be arranged

13:13.400 --> 13:15.400
into quadruple and quadruple.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.400
If we consider a triangle,

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
you will find that

13:19.400 --> 13:21.400
we can easily use one shape

13:21.400 --> 13:23.400
or a hexagon like this,

13:23.400 --> 13:24.400
we can fill the whole surface.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
What about octagon?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
Octagon is very similar to quadruple.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
I forgot to draw here today.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.400
If we try to connect here,

13:41.400 --> 13:43.400
if we try to connect here,

13:44.400 --> 13:45.400
this position,

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
this position,

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
this position,

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
this position,

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
when the line comes out,

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
the line comes out,

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
its point is different.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.400
Its point is different.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
It doesn't meet the so-called

13:57.400 --> 13:58.400
symmetrical axis.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
What about pentagon?

14:02.400 --> 14:03.400
When the pentagon comes out,

14:03.400 --> 14:04.400
it can't be arranged

14:04.400 --> 14:07.400
with a single shape.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
If you are sensitive to shape,

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
you may find that

14:10.400 --> 14:11.400
in this place,

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
the so-called naked places,

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
we can actually

14:13.400 --> 14:15.400
split it into other shapes

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
to describe it.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.400
I will continue to talk about it later.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
That is to say,

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
in traditional polygons,

14:20.400 --> 14:23.400
in various different polygons,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.400
it seems to have many possibilities,

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
but in fact,

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
in addition to the general

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
two-axis, three-axis, four-axis, six-axis,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
we can't just use one unit

14:32.400 --> 14:36.400
to fill the whole plane.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
So the so-called 5, 8, 10, 12

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
seems to be symmetrical,

14:39.400 --> 14:40.400
but in fact,

14:40.400 --> 14:41.400
it does not meet

14:41.400 --> 14:42.400
the conventional theorem of

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
traditional algebra.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
So,

14:47.400 --> 14:49.400
to sum up,

14:51.400 --> 14:52.400
according to the theory of the line of the pentagon,

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
the so-called conventional pentagon

14:54.400 --> 14:56.400
must have one-dimensional symmetry.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.400
That is,

14:57.400 --> 14:58.400
we know the position of an element,

14:58.400 --> 14:59.400
we can easily use

14:59.400 --> 15:01.400
a multiplication method

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
to describe the position of all elements.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
That is to say,

15:04.400 --> 15:06.400
if its D space is 1,

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
I may be 1D, 2D,

15:07.400 --> 15:09.400
3D, 4D, 5D, 6D,

15:09.400 --> 15:10.400
and so on,

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
to find the corresponding element.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
What is the second one?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.400
It only accepts

15:16.400 --> 15:20.400
the rotation operation of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 layers.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.400
Okay,

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
then we come to

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
the concatenation.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.400
In fact, the concatenation

15:26.400 --> 15:28.400
was not proposed

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
by Dan Shetman

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
at the beginning.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.400
The concatenation word

15:33.400 --> 15:34.400
is just a

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
long and interesting thing.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
However,

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
he just said

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
why there is a

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
completely

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
against

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
the concatenation of a

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
symmetrical existence.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
As I just mentioned,

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
if we can

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
find a

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
congruent graph

15:50.400 --> 15:51.400
in the

15:51.400 --> 15:52.400
electromagnetic graph,

15:52.400 --> 15:53.400
then we can

15:54.400 --> 15:56.400
connect in the actual space

15:56.400 --> 15:58.400
to find a

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
arrangement

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
with the same

16:00.400 --> 16:02.400
geometry.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.400
But this thing

16:03.400 --> 16:05.400
doesn't seem to be able to

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
completely fill

16:06.400 --> 16:07.400
the whole plane.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
So isn't it

16:10.400 --> 16:11.400
congruent?

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
But as we just mentioned,

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
if

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
the color spots are shown,

16:16.400 --> 16:17.400
when these color spots are shown,

16:17.400 --> 16:19.400
it seems to have to be congruent.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.400
So what the hell happened?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.400
Okay,

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
this is a

16:25.400 --> 16:26.400
electromagnetic graph

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
made by Dan Shetman.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.400
We use

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
a very traditional

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
algebraic way

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
to make it

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
according to its rotation angle

16:32.400 --> 16:34.400
to find all of its

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
symmetrical

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
directions.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.400
And finally,

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
it's possible that

16:40.400 --> 16:41.400
this is

16:41.400 --> 16:42.400
a form of

16:42.400 --> 16:43.400
icosahedron.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.400
This thing

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
has six pentagons,

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
ten triangles,

16:46.400 --> 16:47.400
and fifteen

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
quadrangles.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
The position of the quadrangles

16:49.400 --> 16:50.400
is in this position.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
We can see

16:51.400 --> 16:52.400
the zero position.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.400
The triangle is

16:54.400 --> 16:55.400
obviously the

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
position of this triangle.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.400
This is the position

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
corresponding to

16:58.400 --> 16:59.400
this triangle.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.400
The pentagon is

17:01.400 --> 17:02.400
the vertical

17:02.400 --> 17:03.400
from this point.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.400
Here are five

17:05.400 --> 17:06.400
triangles

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
combined into this position.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
Okay,

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
this thing is

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
very interesting.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.400
So,

17:15.400 --> 17:16.400
in fact,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.400
in 1976,

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
Penrose,

17:19.400 --> 17:20.400
a very famous

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
teacher,

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
was thinking

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
how to use

17:23.400 --> 17:24.400
the smallest set

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
to lay out

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
all the plane

17:26.400 --> 17:27.400
or how we

17:27.400 --> 17:28.400
can arrange

17:28.400 --> 17:29.400
all the polynomials

17:29.400 --> 17:30.400
into a plane.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.400
This is

17:32.400 --> 17:33.400
one of the

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
patterns of

17:34.400 --> 17:35.400
Penrose.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
In fact,

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
Penrose patterns

17:37.400 --> 17:38.400
have many

17:38.400 --> 17:39.400
different forms.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.400
Finally,

17:40.400 --> 17:41.400
this thing

17:41.400 --> 17:42.400
is the most

17:42.400 --> 17:43.400
similar to

17:43.400 --> 17:44.400
quadrangles.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.400
McKay

17:47.400 --> 17:48.400
also contributed

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
to quadrangles

17:49.400 --> 17:50.400
very well.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.400
He was doing this

17:51.400 --> 17:52.400
at the beginning.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.400
This is using

17:53.400 --> 17:54.400
Fourier transform

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
to transform

17:55.400 --> 17:56.400
from

17:56.400 --> 17:57.400
one of

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
Penrose patterns

17:58.400 --> 17:59.400
to another.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.400
If we go back

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
and see,

18:03.400 --> 18:04.400
it's a little bit

18:04.400 --> 18:05.400
similar to this pattern.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
In fact,

18:07.400 --> 18:08.400
they knew each other

18:08.400 --> 18:09.400
at that time.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
But

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
they didn't know

18:11.400 --> 18:12.400
each other.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.400
So,

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
no one could

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
use a reasonable

18:15.400 --> 18:16.400
mathematical model

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
to describe

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
what exactly

18:18.400 --> 18:19.400
Penrose's

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
tiling looks like.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
Is this

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
the way

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
to arrange the atoms?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
Then,

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
later,

18:27.400 --> 18:28.400
at that time,

18:28.400 --> 18:30.400
Paul Steinhardt

18:30.400 --> 18:31.400
was

18:31.400 --> 18:32.400
actually

18:32.400 --> 18:33.400
he kept

18:33.400 --> 18:34.400
claiming that

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
he thought

18:35.400 --> 18:36.400
it was the tiling he found.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.400
In fact,

18:37.400 --> 18:38.400
the term tiling

18:38.400 --> 18:39.400
was also defined by him.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.400
At that time,

18:40.400 --> 18:41.400
he was also inspired

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
by Penrose patterns.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.400
There has always been a theory.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.400
But

18:44.400 --> 18:45.400
until 1984,

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
there was no

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
material coming out,

18:47.400 --> 18:48.400
so he didn't publish it.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.400
In fact,

18:49.400 --> 18:50.400
when he published

18:50.400 --> 18:51.400
this article,

18:51.400 --> 18:52.400
it was only a little bit

18:52.400 --> 18:53.400
later than

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
Dan Shatman.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.400
As soon as he published it,

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
he sorted out

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
this article

18:57.400 --> 18:58.400
and threw it out.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.400
Pay attention to

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
the pattern

19:00.400 --> 19:01.400
of this pattern

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
in this article.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
This is from Dan Shatman.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.400
This is from Dan Shatman.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.400
This is a pattern

19:05.400 --> 19:06.400
in the fast-acting

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
aluminum alloy

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
in Dan Shatman's

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
article.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
This is very similar.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.400
Later,

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
Steinhardt

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
did not publish

19:13.400 --> 19:14.400
this article

19:14.400 --> 19:15.400
because

19:15.400 --> 19:16.400
he thought

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
it was the tiling

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
he found.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
This is

19:19.400 --> 19:20.400
the pattern

19:20.400 --> 19:21.400
in the

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
fast-acting

19:22.400 --> 19:23.400
aluminum alloy.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.400
The pattern

19:24.400 --> 19:25.400
is very similar

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
to the pattern

19:26.400 --> 19:27.400
in the

19:27.400 --> 19:28.400
fast-acting

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
aluminum alloy.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.400
Dan Shatman

19:30.400 --> 19:31.400
did several

19:31.400 --> 19:32.400
experiments on this

19:32.400 --> 19:33.400
and tried to observe

19:33.400 --> 19:34.400
these things.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
He did a very

19:35.400 --> 19:36.400
beautiful paper

19:36.400 --> 19:37.400
on the mathematical

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
model and

19:38.400 --> 19:39.400
this thing.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
From the theoretical

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
calculation

19:41.400 --> 19:42.400
to the actual

19:42.400 --> 19:43.400
arrangement,

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
he did

19:44.400 --> 19:45.400
everything

19:45.400 --> 19:46.400
he could

19:46.400 --> 19:47.400
in the

19:47.400 --> 19:48.400
experiment.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.400
But

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
at that time,

19:50.400 --> 19:51.400
there was no way

19:51.400 --> 19:52.400
to see

19:52.400 --> 19:53.400
where the

19:53.400 --> 19:54.400
original value

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
was.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.400
So at that time,

19:56.400 --> 19:57.400
most people

19:57.400 --> 19:58.400
used the

19:58.400 --> 19:59.400
mathematical model

19:59.400 --> 20:00.400
to see

20:00.400 --> 20:01.400
what the

20:01.400 --> 20:02.400
actual situation

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
was.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.400
But this article

20:04.400 --> 20:05.400
is really

20:05.400 --> 20:06.400
beautiful.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.400
If you are

20:07.400 --> 20:08.400
interested in

20:08.400 --> 20:09.400
this kind of

20:09.400 --> 20:10.400
calculation,

20:10.400 --> 20:11.400
you can

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
take a look.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.400
But

20:23.400 --> 20:24.400
before that,

20:24.400 --> 20:25.400
although

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
many people

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
made very

20:27.400 --> 20:28.400
difficult

20:28.400 --> 20:29.400
calculations

20:29.400 --> 20:30.400
and

20:30.400 --> 20:31.400
very good

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
electromagnetic

20:32.400 --> 20:33.400
graph,

20:33.400 --> 20:34.400
many people

20:34.400 --> 20:35.400
did not

20:35.400 --> 20:36.400
believe in

20:36.400 --> 20:37.400
this thing.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.400
Why?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.400
Because

20:39.400 --> 20:40.400
people thought

20:40.400 --> 20:41.400
they could

20:41.400 --> 20:42.400
not see

20:42.400 --> 20:43.400
the real

20:43.400 --> 20:44.400
thing.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.400
Because

20:45.400 --> 20:46.400
at that time,

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
it was

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
only possible

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
to make

20:49.400 --> 20:50.400
this kind

20:50.400 --> 20:51.400
of crystal

20:51.400 --> 20:52.400
structure

20:52.400 --> 20:53.400
in a

20:53.400 --> 20:54.400
fast

20:54.400 --> 20:55.400
way.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.400
Like

20:56.400 --> 20:57.400
you can

20:57.400 --> 20:58.400
rotate 36 degrees

20:58.400 --> 20:59.400
to form

20:59.400 --> 21:00.400
a small

21:00.400 --> 21:01.400
group

21:01.400 --> 21:02.400
and then

21:02.400 --> 21:03.400
it becomes

21:03.400 --> 21:04.400
a state

21:04.400 --> 21:05.400
that is

21:05.400 --> 21:06.400
symmetrical.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.400
Can you

21:07.400 --> 21:08.400
see

21:08.400 --> 21:09.400
that

21:09.400 --> 21:10.400
one

21:10.400 --> 21:11.400
on my

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
side?

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
Can you see

21:13.400 --> 21:14.400
it?

21:14.400 --> 21:15.400
Can you

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
see

21:16.400 --> 21:17.400
it?

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
Can you

21:18.400 --> 21:19.400
see

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
it?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.400
Can you

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
see

21:22.400 --> 21:23.400
it?

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
Can you

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
see

21:25.400 --> 21:26.400
it?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.400
Let me

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
mate it.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.400
I don't think it's too clear.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.400
Let's see.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.400
Mating.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
Mating.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
Lag.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.400
You see

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
it.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.400
Ah!

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
This is

21:50.400 --> 21:51.400
if we look

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
at this place

21:52.400 --> 21:53.400
.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.400
This is

21:54.400 --> 21:55.400
this is a direction

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
of the pentagon.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.400
It is

22:00.400 --> 22:01.400
along this thing

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
like this.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
Hey.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.400
Up five, down five.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.400
There is a positive five here.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.400
There is a negative five here.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
Then you

22:09.400 --> 22:10.400
I'm sorry to let you imagine.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
Just look at it from here.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
You will see

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
there are ten things.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
At that time, he felt

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
that he was

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
like this.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
A rotating

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
twin like this.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.400
Um.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.400
OK.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
Then at that time

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
until 1987

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
Professor Tsai An-pong

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
he was

22:44.400 --> 22:45.400
uh

22:45.400 --> 22:46.400
he was originally

22:46.400 --> 22:47.400
made of non-metallic alloy

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
and then made a picture

22:48.400 --> 22:49.400
Oh!

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
It seems

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
to look like gold.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.400
He started

22:52.400 --> 22:53.400
to think it was interesting

22:53.400 --> 22:54.400
because he thought it was beautiful.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.400
Why

22:55.400 --> 22:56.400
can you make so many spots?

22:56.400 --> 22:57.400
He saw a lot of points

22:57.400 --> 22:58.400
and he was very happy.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.400
Then he started to make gold.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.400
Then at the beginning

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
in fact, this alloy

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
this thing

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
he was very early

23:06.400 --> 23:07.400
very early

23:07.400 --> 23:08.400
very early

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
in the 1930s

23:09.400 --> 23:10.400
there was already an image.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
He was in a very quiet area.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.400
He did not

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
he wrote a question mark.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.400
Then he

23:14.400 --> 23:15.400
just tried it at that time.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.400
Just go around there

23:16.400 --> 23:17.400
and do it

23:17.400 --> 23:18.400
do it

23:18.400 --> 23:19.400
do it

23:19.400 --> 23:20.400
do it

23:20.400 --> 23:21.400
do it

23:21.400 --> 23:22.400
do it

23:22.400 --> 23:23.400
Then he thought

23:23.400 --> 23:24.400
what is it?

23:24.400 --> 23:25.400
Just

23:25.400 --> 23:26.400
Oh!

23:26.400 --> 23:27.400
It's done.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
Then heat treatment

23:28.400 --> 23:29.400
He started to do

23:29.400 --> 23:30.400
quench

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
is to do

23:31.400 --> 23:32.400
fast cooling

23:32.400 --> 23:33.400
and then

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
do the general

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
alloy

23:35.400 --> 23:36.400
and then

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
found that after the heat treatment

23:37.400 --> 23:38.400
Hey!

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
He is the same thing.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.400
So

23:40.400 --> 23:41.400
at that time

23:41.400 --> 23:42.400
it was called

23:42.400 --> 23:43.400
heat-stable

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
heat-stable crystal.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
Then we can see

23:45.400 --> 23:46.400
here

23:46.400 --> 23:47.400
he has a very beautiful

23:47.400 --> 23:48.400
Dodecahedron

23:48.400 --> 23:49.400
a shape

23:49.400 --> 23:50.400
This is

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
one of them

23:51.400 --> 23:52.400
Dodecahedron

23:53.400 --> 23:54.400
Then here we will see

23:54.400 --> 23:55.400
Generally in the index

23:55.400 --> 23:56.400
When quenching

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
We will use

23:57.400 --> 23:58.400
six indexes

23:58.400 --> 23:59.400
This is what I just said

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
Because quenching itself

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
has no cycle

24:01.400 --> 24:02.400
So we have to

24:02.400 --> 24:03.400
project it to the end

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
Do

24:04.400 --> 24:05.400
After using two indexes to describe it

24:05.400 --> 24:06.400
Go again

24:06.400 --> 24:07.400
Write it out

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
So here we are

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
We will know

24:13.400 --> 24:14.400
The definition of quenching

24:14.400 --> 24:15.400
There will be a few conditions

24:15.400 --> 24:17.400
It must have

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
Traditional quenching

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
non-existent

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
The first is

24:21.400 --> 24:22.400
The rotation property of the crystal

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
Then the second is

24:23.400 --> 24:25.400
It must be

24:26.400 --> 24:27.400
Have a

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
Quasi-periodic

24:28.400 --> 24:29.400
Ordered

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
This thing

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
Because it has a

24:31.400 --> 24:32.400
Very sharp

24:32.400 --> 24:33.400
Diffraction spots

24:34.400 --> 24:35.400
Then we describe

24:35.400 --> 24:36.400
When this quenching

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
We will at least

24:37.400 --> 24:38.400
Need to use

24:38.400 --> 24:40.400
Three axis of導之空間

24:40.400 --> 24:41.400
To describe it

24:42.400 --> 24:43.400
That

24:43.400 --> 24:44.400
The more interesting thing is

24:44.400 --> 24:45.400
In fact, if

24:45.400 --> 24:46.400
Uh

24:46.400 --> 24:47.400
For

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
The golden ratio is very interesting

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
This tau is the golden ratio

24:49.400 --> 24:50.400
Actually

24:50.400 --> 24:51.400
Uh

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
The pentagon

24:52.400 --> 24:53.400
This

24:53.400 --> 24:54.400
When it cuts

24:54.400 --> 24:55.400
We go to find it

24:55.400 --> 24:56.400
Some nodes

24:56.400 --> 24:57.400
Go to both sides

24:57.400 --> 24:58.400
When doing a subtraction

24:58.400 --> 24:59.400
Will get a golden ratio

24:59.400 --> 25:00.400
This is the thing

25:00.400 --> 25:01.400
That's why

25:01.400 --> 25:02.400
Quenching

25:02.400 --> 25:03.400
Will be like this in the array

25:04.400 --> 25:05.400
That

25:05.400 --> 25:06.400
I seem to have a structure later

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
I'll talk about it in detail

25:08.400 --> 25:09.400
Why is it like this

25:10.400 --> 25:11.400
Okay, everyone will be curious

25:11.400 --> 25:12.400
Quenching in actual space

25:12.400 --> 25:13.400
What will it be like

25:13.400 --> 25:14.400
In fact

25:14.400 --> 25:15.400
If we look at it from the second dimension

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
Its array is a

25:16.400 --> 25:17.400
Just

25:17.400 --> 25:18.400
This penrose

25:18.400 --> 25:19.400
This penrose pattern

25:19.400 --> 25:20.400
This is in

25:20.400 --> 25:21.400
Uh

25:21.400 --> 25:22.400
The two-dimensional state in space

25:23.400 --> 25:24.400
What about the three-dimensional state

25:24.400 --> 25:25.400
That's what I just said

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
In fact, we use it more often

25:26.400 --> 25:27.400
Is this

25:27.400 --> 25:28.400
Icosahedron

25:28.400 --> 25:29.400
In fact, so far

25:29.400 --> 25:30.400
The development of quenching

25:30.400 --> 25:31.400
There are already various

25:31.400 --> 25:32.400
Different clusters

25:32.400 --> 25:33.400
Various different forms

25:33.400 --> 25:34.400
Even

25:34.400 --> 25:35.400
Actually

25:35.400 --> 25:36.400
Linus Pauling

25:36.400 --> 25:37.400
Although the quenching

25:37.400 --> 25:38.400
Is not a

25:38.400 --> 25:39.400
The real

25:39.400 --> 25:40.400
Material state

25:42.400 --> 25:43.400
But its drive also tells

25:43.400 --> 25:44.400
Uh

25:44.400 --> 25:45.400
Another thing that comes out

25:45.400 --> 25:46.400
Is the so-called

25:47.400 --> 25:48.400
Quenching crystal

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
Everyone take a look

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
Can you see it?

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
Take a look

26:02.400 --> 26:03.400
These two things we can see

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
Top

26:04.400 --> 26:06.400
Let me compare the top ball

26:08.400 --> 26:09.400
This one

26:09.400 --> 26:10.400
Yes yes yes

26:10.400 --> 26:11.400
The big red cluster

26:12.400 --> 26:13.400
These two things

26:13.400 --> 26:14.400
It's actually the same thing

26:14.400 --> 26:15.400
But

26:15.400 --> 26:16.400
If you are in the case of quenching

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
It will be like this

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
Keep connecting

26:18.400 --> 26:19.400
Keep connecting

26:19.400 --> 26:20.400
That may be less connected here

26:20.400 --> 26:22.400
Only three and a half units are connected here

26:23.400 --> 26:24.400
When you keep extending

26:24.400 --> 26:25.400
You will see different situations

26:25.400 --> 26:27.400
If you are interested, you can come and visit

26:27.400 --> 26:28.400
We are

26:28.400 --> 26:29.400
On the platform

26:30.400 --> 26:31.400
Then the other one is

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
Pauling

26:32.400 --> 26:33.400
Pauling

26:33.400 --> 26:34.400
At that time

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
To quench

26:35.400 --> 26:36.400
He just thinks

26:37.400 --> 26:38.400
This is actually just a kind of

26:38.400 --> 26:39.400
Uh

26:39.400 --> 26:40.400
In the cubic

26:40.400 --> 26:41.400
A double crystal structure

26:41.400 --> 26:42.400
So your

26:42.400 --> 26:43.400
Uh

26:43.400 --> 26:44.400
Quenching crystal

26:44.400 --> 26:45.400
It will

26:45.400 --> 26:46.400
Uh

26:46.400 --> 26:47.400
It may exist in a certain position in its corner

26:47.400 --> 26:48.400
Then continue to combine

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
Combine

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
That

26:50.400 --> 26:51.400
This is actually

26:51.400 --> 26:52.400
We later

26:52.400 --> 26:53.400
It is a kind of

26:53.400 --> 26:54.400
Uh

26:54.400 --> 26:56.400
We call 110 quenching crystal

26:56.400 --> 26:57.400
Or 11 quenching crystal

26:57.400 --> 26:58.400
Or

26:58.400 --> 26:59.400
Uh

26:59.400 --> 27:00.400
32 quenching

27:00.400 --> 27:01.400
21 quenching crystal

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
Or 32 quenching crystal

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
That

27:03.400 --> 27:04.400
This is in the case of high-dimensional projection

27:04.400 --> 27:05.400
His

27:06.400 --> 27:08.400
Long-edged brush and short-edged brush

27:08.400 --> 27:09.400
A

27:09.400 --> 27:10.400
Convex state

27:10.400 --> 27:11.400
Then there is

27:14.400 --> 27:15.400
Uh

27:15.400 --> 27:16.400
It is

27:16.400 --> 27:17.400
A

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
Convex

27:18.400 --> 27:19.400
Convex

27:19.400 --> 27:20.400
Convex

27:20.400 --> 27:21.400
Convex

27:21.400 --> 27:22.400
Convex

27:22.400 --> 27:23.400
Then there is another state

27:23.400 --> 27:24.400
Is

27:24.400 --> 27:25.400
Purely 10-axis symmetrical

27:25.400 --> 27:26.400
This thing

27:26.400 --> 27:27.400
We call

27:27.400 --> 27:28.400
Uh

27:28.400 --> 27:29.400
Delta

27:29.400 --> 27:30.400
Um

27:30.400 --> 27:31.400
Decagonal type

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
That

27:32.400 --> 27:33.400
This thing will appear in

27:33.400 --> 27:35.400
Also appear in the aluminum convex crystal

27:35.400 --> 27:36.400
That

27:36.400 --> 27:37.400
This thing

27:37.400 --> 27:39.400
It will have a very strong

27:39.400 --> 27:40.400
Impression

27:40.400 --> 27:41.400
Because

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
We are from this

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
If our

27:44.400 --> 27:45.400
It will actually have a lot of

27:45.400 --> 27:46.400
Phonon drag

27:46.400 --> 27:47.400
With some

27:47.400 --> 27:48.400
Radiation

27:48.400 --> 27:49.400
Because it has more

27:49.400 --> 27:50.400
Phason

27:50.400 --> 27:51.400
Ah

27:51.400 --> 27:52.400
Phason can actually be understood as

27:52.400 --> 27:53.400
Uh

27:53.400 --> 27:54.400
A defect in the convex

27:54.400 --> 27:55.400
Or dislocation

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
The part

27:56.400 --> 27:57.400
Then it is here

27:57.400 --> 27:58.400
It is a very symmetrical

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
A symmetrical structure

27:59.400 --> 28:00.400
Uh

28:00.400 --> 28:01.400
So his side

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
Um

28:02.400 --> 28:03.400
That kind of radiation

28:03.400 --> 28:04.400
What

28:04.400 --> 28:05.400
Isolation rate

28:05.400 --> 28:06.400
Will be

28:06.400 --> 28:07.400
In

28:07.400 --> 28:08.400
Vertical

28:08.400 --> 28:09.400
That

28:09.400 --> 28:10.400
Very, very much

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
Um

28:12.400 --> 28:13.400
That

28:13.400 --> 28:14.400
This stable

28:14.400 --> 28:15.400
Stable convex crystal in thermodynamics

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400
Just for

28:16.400 --> 28:17.400
Our

28:17.400 --> 28:18.400
This

28:19.400 --> 28:20.400
The crystal brings a new definition

28:20.400 --> 28:21.400
Because in the past

28:21.400 --> 28:22.400
What I just said

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
The definition of the so-called convex crystal is

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Uh

28:26.400 --> 28:27.400
In a solid

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
Its atoms are all

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
Have a

28:29.400 --> 28:30.400
Stable

28:30.400 --> 28:31.400
Line

28:31.400 --> 28:32.400
And it can be

28:32.400 --> 28:33.400
Flat

28:33.400 --> 28:34.400
And it has a certain

28:34.400 --> 28:35.400
Rotational properties

28:35.400 --> 28:36.400
That

28:36.400 --> 28:37.400
What is the new definition

28:37.400 --> 28:38.400
Is

28:38.400 --> 28:39.400
We can all

28:39.400 --> 28:40.400
In

28:40.400 --> 28:41.400
That

28:41.400 --> 28:42.400
Causing the space to find

28:42.400 --> 28:43.400
Any symmetry

28:43.400 --> 28:44.400
When

28:44.400 --> 28:45.400
We will call it

28:45.400 --> 28:46.400
Is a kind of convex

28:46.400 --> 28:47.400
That this

28:47.400 --> 28:48.400
This is a new view of matter

28:48.400 --> 28:49.400
Ok

28:49.400 --> 28:50.400
Then I will now cut into

28:50.400 --> 28:51.400
The part of the eye is

28:51.400 --> 28:52.400
Uh

28:52.400 --> 28:53.400
Stability of the convex crystal

28:53.400 --> 28:54.400
In fact, this is

28:54.400 --> 28:55.400
At the beginning

28:55.400 --> 28:56.400
Mr. Tsai is doing this

28:56.400 --> 28:57.400
He also said

28:57.400 --> 28:58.400
He just wanted to say

28:58.400 --> 28:59.400
Ah

28:59.400 --> 29:00.400
Why can I make aluminum copper iron

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
Ah

29:01.400 --> 29:02.400
Other

29:02.400 --> 29:03.400
Is there any other way

29:03.400 --> 29:04.400
Can

29:04.400 --> 29:05.400
Uh

29:05.400 --> 29:06.400
So

29:06.400 --> 29:07.400
This

29:07.400 --> 29:08.400
This

29:08.400 --> 29:09.400
This

29:09.400 --> 29:10.400
You can use this

29:10.400 --> 29:11.400
It's all

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
Ah

29:36.400 --> 29:37.400
The third is

29:37.400 --> 29:38.400
Uh

29:38.400 --> 29:40.400
One of the more important points is

29:40.400 --> 29:41.400
His

29:41.400 --> 29:43.400
Average electronic density

29:43.400 --> 29:44.400
That

29:44.400 --> 29:47.400
In the aluminum alkyl

29:47.400 --> 29:48.400
We have one

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
More common E over A value

29:50.400 --> 29:51.400
We call E over A value

29:51.400 --> 29:53.400
Called 1.8

29:53.400 --> 29:54.400
Then we are in our circle

29:54.400 --> 29:56.400
We call magic number

29:59.400 --> 30:01.400
Then the second stability factor is

30:01.400 --> 30:03.400
We can start with this

30:03.400 --> 30:04.400
Average electronic density

30:04.400 --> 30:05.400
And our

30:05.400 --> 30:06.400
Uh

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
From that

30:08.400 --> 30:10.400
In the electromagnetic radiation space

30:10.400 --> 30:11.400
See his

30:11.400 --> 30:12.400
The amount of G

30:12.400 --> 30:13.400
We can assess

30:13.400 --> 30:14.400
Say his

30:14.400 --> 30:15.400
That

30:15.400 --> 30:16.400
Polycarbonate

30:16.400 --> 30:17.400
With

30:17.400 --> 30:18.400
Phenol

30:18.400 --> 30:19.400
Uh, our phenol

30:19.400 --> 30:20.400
In fact, it is a

30:20.400 --> 30:21.400
Phenol

30:21.400 --> 30:22.400
Because in fact, we can't really estimate it

30:22.400 --> 30:24.400
We just use a static value

30:24.400 --> 30:25.400
Go to him

30:25.400 --> 30:26.400
To solve him

30:26.400 --> 30:27.400
This thing can be seen

30:27.400 --> 30:28.400
He is

30:28.400 --> 30:30.400
It has something to do with his E over A

30:30.400 --> 30:31.400
Then

30:31.400 --> 30:32.400
We can get

30:32.400 --> 30:33.400
Such a relationship

30:33.400 --> 30:34.400
Then we see

30:34.400 --> 30:35.400
Aluminum alkyl

30:35.400 --> 30:36.400
Is

30:36.400 --> 30:37.400
This is the aluminum alkyl with the transition element

30:37.400 --> 30:38.400
Aluminum alkyl

30:38.400 --> 30:40.400
He will follow this relationship

30:42.400 --> 30:43.400
But in this aluminum alkyl of Cd

30:43.400 --> 30:44.400
His

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
E over A is actually equal to 2

30:46.400 --> 30:47.400
That

30:47.400 --> 30:48.400
This thing

30:48.400 --> 30:49.400
He later

30:49.400 --> 30:50.400
We have observed that he has a

30:50.400 --> 30:51.400
SPD track

30:51.400 --> 30:52.400
The effect of miscellaneous

30:52.400 --> 30:54.400
Will cause in that

30:56.400 --> 30:58.400
Near the aluminum alkyl

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
A widening of the track area

31:00.400 --> 31:01.400
Then this

31:01.400 --> 31:02.400
So currently actually

31:02.400 --> 31:03.400
Aluminum alkyl

31:03.400 --> 31:04.400
In this so-called E over A

31:05.400 --> 31:06.400
There is no one

31:06.400 --> 31:07.400
Better

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
Or more complete

31:08.400 --> 31:09.400
Regulation

31:09.400 --> 31:10.400
Then this is also one of our

31:10.400 --> 31:11.400
Challenge now

31:14.400 --> 31:15.400
That

31:16.400 --> 31:17.400
But this is a

31:17.400 --> 31:18.400
More controversial

31:18.400 --> 31:19.400
That is

31:19.400 --> 31:20.400
Generally we know that aluminum is

31:20.400 --> 31:21.400
Three elements

31:21.400 --> 31:22.400
Three elements

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
He wears three

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
The same normal

31:24.400 --> 31:25.400
He has an electrolyte

31:25.400 --> 31:26.400
Wear one

31:26.400 --> 31:27.400
Then why is the iron

31:27.400 --> 31:28.400
About negative 2.66

31:28.400 --> 31:29.400
This is

31:29.400 --> 31:30.400
In the previous

31:30.400 --> 31:31.400
Calculated one

31:31.400 --> 31:32.400
A

31:32.400 --> 31:33.400
The probability of splitting the track

31:33.400 --> 31:34.400
A probability

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
Iron in this system

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
He must be in

31:37.400 --> 31:38.400
Negative 2.66

31:38.400 --> 31:39.400
That this is also a

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
Very interesting place

31:40.400 --> 31:41.400
That is

31:41.400 --> 31:42.400
How do we use this

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
Full element

31:43.400 --> 31:44.400
Go

31:44.400 --> 31:45.400
Um

31:45.400 --> 31:46.400
Use elements of aluminum alkyl

31:46.400 --> 31:47.400
Go

31:47.400 --> 31:48.400
Adjust some of his features

31:48.400 --> 31:49.400
Is he

31:49.400 --> 31:50.400
DS

31:50.400 --> 31:51.400
Or his

31:51.400 --> 31:53.400
Some of the effects of track miscellaneous

31:53.400 --> 31:56.400
That time we went to iron

31:57.400 --> 31:58.400
Rutanium

31:58.400 --> 31:59.400
Then

31:59.400 --> 32:00.400
Oslim

32:00.400 --> 32:01.400
Sit down like this

32:01.400 --> 32:02.400
Find out

32:02.400 --> 32:03.400
They are in the same group

32:03.400 --> 32:04.400
Under the circumstances

32:04.400 --> 32:05.400
Their outermost

32:05.400 --> 32:06.400
Electrolyte state is the same

32:06.400 --> 32:07.400
These can be done

32:07.400 --> 32:08.400
Very stable nodule

32:08.400 --> 32:09.400
Then

32:10.400 --> 32:11.400
I made a mistake

32:11.400 --> 32:12.400
Ah

32:12.400 --> 32:13.400
I put the wrong side

32:13.400 --> 32:14.400
This TMG

32:14.400 --> 32:15.400
This line

32:17.400 --> 32:18.400
I'm sorry

32:18.400 --> 32:19.400
That

32:19.400 --> 32:20.400
It's about 1.8 here

32:20.400 --> 32:21.400
That

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
In this part

32:22.400 --> 32:23.400
More people are doing

32:23.400 --> 32:24.400
Is

32:24.400 --> 32:25.400
Developing towards hot metal

32:25.400 --> 32:26.400
Or

32:26.400 --> 32:27.400
They go

32:27.400 --> 32:28.400
Want to see

32:28.400 --> 32:29.400
Inside a cluster

32:29.400 --> 32:30.400
If he lacks a

32:30.400 --> 32:31.400
Will it lead him to the whole

32:31.400 --> 32:32.400
That

32:32.400 --> 32:33.400
Metal sword

32:33.400 --> 32:34.400
The price

32:34.400 --> 32:35.400
Ah

32:35.400 --> 32:36.400
A transfer phenomenon

32:36.400 --> 32:37.400
At present

32:37.400 --> 32:38.400
They use that

32:38.400 --> 32:39.400
That

32:41.400 --> 32:42.400
The way of man-made engineering

32:42.400 --> 32:43.400
In

32:43.400 --> 32:44.400
Make this prediction

32:44.400 --> 32:47.400
What is the element of half the number

32:47.400 --> 32:48.400
Um

32:48.400 --> 32:49.400
Some of you

32:49.400 --> 32:50.400
Composite

32:50.400 --> 32:51.400
What is that

32:51.400 --> 32:52.400
Composition

32:52.400 --> 32:53.400
What

32:53.400 --> 32:54.400
Ah

32:54.400 --> 32:55.400
This is actually

32:55.400 --> 32:56.400
His

32:56.400 --> 32:57.400
It's all 100

32:57.400 --> 32:58.400
It's all 100

32:58.400 --> 32:59.400
It's all 100

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
This is the original ratio

33:00.400 --> 33:01.400
Ah

33:01.400 --> 33:02.400
Then we will follow this original ratio

33:02.400 --> 33:03.400
Let's say

33:03.400 --> 33:04.400
Ah

33:04.400 --> 33:05.400
This aluminum is

33:05.400 --> 33:06.400
With three additives

33:06.400 --> 33:07.400
Multiply by 3

33:07.400 --> 33:08.400
Then this is multiplied by 1

33:08.400 --> 33:10.400
That 12 is multiplied by 2.66

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
Then finally it is a total of 100

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
Divide by 100

33:12.400 --> 33:13.400
We can calculate this

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
A value of 1 over a

33:14.400 --> 33:15.400
A value of 1 over a

33:17.400 --> 33:18.400
Um

33:18.400 --> 33:20.400
That this is currently a

33:20.400 --> 33:21.400
A more stable nodule

33:21.400 --> 33:22.400
A list

33:22.400 --> 33:23.400
If you are interested

33:23.400 --> 33:24.400
You can take a look

33:24.400 --> 33:25.400
Hey

33:25.400 --> 33:26.400
Maybe it's related to your

33:26.400 --> 33:27.400
Uh

33:27.400 --> 33:28.400
You can take it and do it

33:28.400 --> 33:29.400
There are some

33:29.400 --> 33:30.400
In the structure

33:30.400 --> 33:31.400
Some more

33:31.400 --> 33:32.400
Different or special

33:32.400 --> 33:33.400
Some things

33:33.400 --> 33:34.400
That is actually the easiest now

33:34.400 --> 33:35.400
Applied by the business

33:35.400 --> 33:36.400
Maybe it's this

33:36.400 --> 33:37.400
Aluminum and the transition element

33:37.400 --> 33:38.400
This part

33:38.400 --> 33:39.400
Because it also contains more

33:39.400 --> 33:40.400
The price is cheaper

33:40.400 --> 33:41.400
So

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
More suitable for mass production

33:42.400 --> 33:44.400
That if it is for

33:44.400 --> 33:45.400
Say

33:45.400 --> 33:46.400
Do basic research

33:46.400 --> 33:47.400
Will be more

33:47.400 --> 33:48.400
If you are interested

33:48.400 --> 33:49.400
Isn't this guess

33:49.400 --> 33:50.400
Teacher Cai

33:50.400 --> 33:51.400
Ah

33:51.400 --> 33:52.400
That this

33:52.400 --> 33:53.400
You can go from here

33:53.400 --> 33:54.400
He will

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
Can make

33:55.400 --> 33:56.400
More likely to make

33:56.400 --> 33:57.400
Two-dimensional nodules

33:57.400 --> 33:58.400
This thing

33:58.400 --> 33:59.400
Uh

33:59.400 --> 34:00.400
On the combination of nodules

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
The concept is a little different

34:05.400 --> 34:06.400
Then I will introduce a little bit

34:06.400 --> 34:07.400
Nodule

34:07.400 --> 34:08.400
It's in

34:08.400 --> 34:09.400
It's obviously made of metal

34:09.400 --> 34:10.400
That

34:10.400 --> 34:11.400
Oh, yeah, from the picture just now

34:11.400 --> 34:12.400
You can know

34:12.400 --> 34:13.400
Most nodules are made of metal

34:13.400 --> 34:14.400
That

34:14.400 --> 34:15.400
Let's take a look at it

34:15.400 --> 34:16.400
In

34:16.400 --> 34:17.400
Different

34:17.400 --> 34:18.400
Its hardness and its

34:18.400 --> 34:19.400
Uh

34:19.400 --> 34:20.400
Um

34:20.400 --> 34:21.400
Electrode

34:21.400 --> 34:22.400
When it's low temperature

34:22.400 --> 34:23.400
Uh

34:23.400 --> 34:24.400
In fact

34:24.400 --> 34:25.400
Nodule

34:25.400 --> 34:26.400
It is a

34:26.400 --> 34:27.400
Negative temperature factor

34:27.400 --> 34:28.400
It's a negative temperature factor

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
So you see

34:29.400 --> 34:30.400
That

34:30.400 --> 34:31.400
Iron, aluminum, copper

34:31.400 --> 34:33.400
When it's high temperature, the electrons rise

34:33.400 --> 34:35.400
It's obviously a combination of aluminum and copper and iron

34:35.400 --> 34:36.400
When it's high temperature

34:36.400 --> 34:37.400
It's a drop

34:37.400 --> 34:38.400
thing

34:38.400 --> 34:39.400
So

34:39.400 --> 34:40.400
In this place

34:40.400 --> 34:41.400
It's on the electromagnetic field

34:41.400 --> 34:42.400
It's closer to the semiconductor

34:42.400 --> 34:43.400
That

34:43.400 --> 34:44.400
It's not that it's all semiconductors

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
We usually call it metal

34:46.400 --> 34:47.400
That

34:47.400 --> 34:48.400
This thing

34:48.400 --> 34:49.400
Its attraction

34:49.400 --> 34:50.400
At the moment at high temperature

34:50.400 --> 34:52.400
Some people will target its phasing

34:52.400 --> 34:53.400
That's what I was talking about

34:53.400 --> 34:54.400
That

34:54.400 --> 34:56.400
In the so-called full space

34:56.400 --> 34:57.400
Some interactions

34:57.400 --> 34:58.400
The state

34:58.400 --> 34:59.400
They think it's like this

34:59.400 --> 35:01.400
There is no better explanation yet

35:01.400 --> 35:02.400
Interpretation

35:02.400 --> 35:03.400
That

35:03.400 --> 35:04.400
If you look at it from the age

35:04.400 --> 35:05.400
If you look at it from the age

35:05.400 --> 35:07.400
It's got a microscope

35:07.400 --> 35:08.400
That

35:08.400 --> 35:09.400
Only electrons can see that

35:09.400 --> 35:10.400
Microscope

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
It may block some of the effects

35:12.400 --> 35:13.400
Or let it jump

35:13.400 --> 35:14.400
Um

35:14.400 --> 35:16.400
In terms of hardness

35:16.400 --> 35:17.400
Uh

35:17.400 --> 35:18.400
This is the general

35:18.400 --> 35:19.400
Uh

35:19.400 --> 35:20.400
Steel is iron

35:20.400 --> 35:22.400
Iron alloy

35:22.400 --> 35:23.400
Then

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
Their hardness is very, very low

35:25.400 --> 35:27.400
It's very, very hard when it's combined

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
Ah

35:28.400 --> 35:30.400
If you look at it from the defect

35:30.400 --> 35:32.400
You can say that the whole body

35:32.400 --> 35:33.400
It's all defects

35:33.400 --> 35:35.400
It's very, very hard

35:35.400 --> 35:36.400
But on the contrary

35:36.400 --> 35:38.400
It's also very, very crisp

35:38.400 --> 35:40.400
That

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
This is currently more likely

35:42.400 --> 35:44.400
And possible applications

35:44.400 --> 35:46.400
In fact, there are quite a few

35:46.400 --> 35:47.400
That

35:47.400 --> 35:48.400
Because like I said

35:48.400 --> 35:49.400
It's very crisp

35:49.400 --> 35:51.400
So usually we use the way of the body

35:51.400 --> 35:52.400
To do

35:52.400 --> 35:53.400
Uh

35:53.400 --> 35:54.400
Some crystal products

35:54.400 --> 35:56.400
Or by coating

35:56.400 --> 35:58.400
Because we want to make the body smaller

35:58.400 --> 35:59.400
We can ignore it

35:59.400 --> 36:00.400
Some

36:00.400 --> 36:02.400
Some harder temperament

36:02.400 --> 36:03.400
That

36:03.400 --> 36:04.400
Like

36:04.400 --> 36:06.400
It's more interesting in this part of the blowing

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
Many people will use this crystal

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
Ah

36:09.400 --> 36:10.400
He went to do that

36:10.400 --> 36:12.400
Get rid of the aluminum in it

36:12.400 --> 36:14.400
That's like copper, iron

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
Copper itself for

36:16.400 --> 36:17.400
Uh, carbon dioxide

36:17.400 --> 36:18.400
It has the characteristic of blowing

36:18.400 --> 36:20.400
Its copper just happens to be on some specific

36:20.400 --> 36:21.400
Edge

36:21.400 --> 36:23.400
In the corner of the crystal

36:23.400 --> 36:24.400
At this time it will

36:24.400 --> 36:26.400
Because it has some special

36:26.400 --> 36:27.400
Uh

36:27.400 --> 36:28.400
Double crystal structure

36:28.400 --> 36:30.400
So it has a better impact on the blowing

36:30.400 --> 36:32.400
I think this part is more interesting

36:32.400 --> 36:34.400
That there is another part

36:34.400 --> 36:35.400
In that

36:35.400 --> 36:37.400
Metal

36:37.400 --> 36:39.400
The part of the metal compound

36:39.400 --> 36:41.400
Now the metal compound

36:41.400 --> 36:42.400
For the crystal

36:42.400 --> 36:43.400
There are mainly two directions

36:43.400 --> 36:44.400
One is mainly

36:44.400 --> 36:46.400
Put the crystal into

36:46.400 --> 36:47.400
Uh

36:47.400 --> 36:48.400
Aluminum alloy

36:48.400 --> 36:49.400
Lala

36:49.400 --> 36:50.400
Boil it up

36:50.400 --> 36:52.400
The other way is to use

36:52.400 --> 36:53.400
Aluminum alloy

36:53.400 --> 36:55.400
After making the aluminum alloy

36:55.400 --> 36:56.400
Then suck it out again

36:56.400 --> 36:57.400
And then at high temperature

36:57.400 --> 36:58.400
Rebound

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
Uh

36:59.400 --> 37:01.400
A high intensity effect

37:01.400 --> 37:02.400
That crystal

37:02.400 --> 37:03.400
Because the surface of the body is very low

37:03.400 --> 37:05.400
So it has a very low friction factor

37:05.400 --> 37:06.400
Then

37:06.400 --> 37:07.400
Also very brittle

37:07.400 --> 37:09.400
Then I will show you later

37:09.400 --> 37:10.400
Uh, some of the current

37:10.400 --> 37:11.400
Crystal products

37:11.400 --> 37:13.400
Ah, there seems to be a film

37:13.400 --> 37:14.400
Ah

37:14.400 --> 37:15.400
Ah

37:15.400 --> 37:17.400
Okay, how did the crystal come out?

37:17.400 --> 37:18.400
I just talked so much

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
How did the crystal come out?

37:19.400 --> 37:20.400
This is a

37:20.400 --> 37:21.400
More traditional

37:21.400 --> 37:22.400
The production of a crystal

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
Ah

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
A metal

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
The relationship of manufacturing

37:25.400 --> 37:26.400
That generally uses

37:26.400 --> 37:27.400
Uh

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
Metal steam or metal liquid

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
If you start with metal liquid

37:29.400 --> 37:30.400
If you start with metal liquid

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
Very reasonable

37:31.400 --> 37:32.400
Uh

37:32.400 --> 37:33.400
Very reasonable to understand

37:33.400 --> 37:34.400
Is like

37:34.400 --> 37:35.400
Casting ah

37:35.400 --> 37:36.400
Aluminum alloy ah

37:36.400 --> 37:37.400
These methods

37:37.400 --> 37:38.400
If we cool down quickly

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
Will get this

37:39.400 --> 37:40.400
Aluminum alloy

37:40.400 --> 37:41.400
Then we cool down slowly

37:41.400 --> 37:42.400
Will get the crystal

37:42.400 --> 37:43.400
In fact, thermodynamics

37:43.400 --> 37:44.400
Stable crystal

37:44.400 --> 37:45.400
In fact, when you cool down slowly

37:45.400 --> 37:47.400
It can also get a crystal

37:47.400 --> 37:48.400
Then I just talked about

37:48.400 --> 37:50.400
Extracted from aluminum alloy

37:50.400 --> 37:51.400
Stable crystal

37:51.400 --> 37:53.400
It's easy to get out of the treasure box

37:53.400 --> 37:55.400
Ah, the alloy of the treasure box

37:55.400 --> 37:56.400
Then use the method of actual effect

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
Let it suck it out

37:57.400 --> 37:58.400
This is

37:58.400 --> 37:59.400
From

37:59.400 --> 38:00.400
Uh

38:00.400 --> 38:01.400
A part of the crystal to the crystal

38:01.400 --> 38:02.400
That

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
From the non-crystal

38:03.400 --> 38:04.400
There is also this thing

38:04.400 --> 38:05.400
There will also be this thing

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
That is, Mr. Tsai

38:06.400 --> 38:07.400
Why did you start

38:07.400 --> 38:08.400
A reason for making a stable crystal

38:08.400 --> 38:09.400
That

38:09.400 --> 38:10.400
Like

38:10.400 --> 38:11.400
At present, someone will also use

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
That

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
PVD

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
PVD way to make a stable crystal

38:14.400 --> 38:15.400
But

38:15.400 --> 38:16.400
Uh

38:16.400 --> 38:17.400
In terms of the control of the treasure

38:17.400 --> 38:18.400
Or some conditions

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
In fact, to make a very high quality

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
Uh

38:21.400 --> 38:22.400
Stable crystal

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
Will be

38:23.400 --> 38:24.400
It's still a big challenge

38:24.400 --> 38:25.400
That

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
That

38:26.400 --> 38:27.400
That

38:27.400 --> 38:28.400
This is what I just summarized

38:28.400 --> 38:29.400
Uh

38:29.400 --> 38:30.400
The so-called processes just now

38:30.400 --> 38:31.400
In fact, this side is

38:31.400 --> 38:32.400
We are more common

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
Some

38:33.400 --> 38:34.400
Some methods of manufacturing stable crystals

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
Including

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
Just the general

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
Traditional casting

38:37.400 --> 38:38.400
There is also that

38:38.400 --> 38:39.400
High-speed cooling

38:39.400 --> 38:40.400
Uh

38:40.400 --> 38:41.400
Beat

38:41.400 --> 38:42.400
The cooling speed per second

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
It's probably more than 3000 degrees

38:43.400 --> 38:44.400
Very fast

38:44.400 --> 38:45.400
Then this

38:45.400 --> 38:46.400
This is also a very fast

38:46.400 --> 38:47.400
Cooling

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
Uh

38:48.400 --> 38:49.400
The latter two are relatively rare

38:49.400 --> 38:50.400
I just

38:50.400 --> 38:51.400
Another one is to use mechanical alloy

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
Is to put a bunch of elements

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
Put it together

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
And then it's high energy

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
Put it together

38:55.400 --> 38:58.400
It's like doing high-speed alloy

38:58.400 --> 38:59.400
Someone does it

38:59.400 --> 39:00.400
And then like that

39:00.400 --> 39:01.400
This is the general

39:01.400 --> 39:02.400
Uh

39:02.400 --> 39:03.400
PVD

39:03.400 --> 39:04.400
PVD like this

39:04.400 --> 39:05.400
But there is a very important point

39:05.400 --> 39:06.400
Is that

39:06.400 --> 39:07.400
If it is not processed

39:07.400 --> 39:09.400
It's actually very rare

39:09.400 --> 39:10.400
Very high quality

39:10.400 --> 39:11.400
Very high quality

39:11.400 --> 39:12.400
Very high quality

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
Very high quality

39:13.400 --> 39:14.400
Unless it is

39:14.400 --> 39:15.400
Certain

39:15.400 --> 39:16.400
Some very specific stable crystals

39:16.400 --> 39:18.400
Can get a better way

39:18.400 --> 39:19.400
Uh

39:19.400 --> 39:20.400
A better one

39:20.400 --> 39:21.400
Uh

39:21.400 --> 39:22.400
Structure

39:22.400 --> 39:23.400
Structure

39:23.400 --> 39:24.400
Structure

39:24.400 --> 39:25.400
That

39:25.400 --> 39:26.400
Finally, let me introduce

39:26.400 --> 39:27.400
We just mentioned so much

39:27.400 --> 39:28.400
Uh

39:28.400 --> 39:29.400
Uh

39:29.400 --> 39:30.400
The crystal will become

39:30.400 --> 39:31.400
Uh

39:31.400 --> 39:32.400
The crystal can run out of the stable crystal

39:32.400 --> 39:33.400
Uh

39:33.400 --> 39:34.400
This is a thin one

39:34.400 --> 39:35.400
And then

39:35.400 --> 39:36.400
Can we

39:36.400 --> 39:37.400
Let the crystal

39:37.400 --> 39:38.400
Directly become a stable crystal

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
This is our recent

39:39.400 --> 39:40.400
A

39:40.400 --> 39:41.400
A new discovery is that we can

39:41.400 --> 39:42.400
Indeed

39:42.400 --> 39:43.400
In a special way

39:43.400 --> 39:44.400
In a special way

39:44.400 --> 39:45.400
Uh

39:45.400 --> 39:46.400
Uh

39:46.400 --> 39:47.400
Make the crystal

39:47.400 --> 39:48.400
Make the crystal

39:48.400 --> 39:49.400
Gradually become a stable crystal

39:49.400 --> 39:50.400
Then we get a composite material

39:50.400 --> 39:51.400
Then

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
Here is a

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
The one I just saw

39:53.400 --> 39:55.400
One of the shapes of the dodecahedron

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
And here

39:56.400 --> 39:57.400
The composition may not be very good

39:57.400 --> 39:59.400
Just happened to take a pretty picture

39:59.400 --> 40:00.400
Just happened to take a pretty picture

40:00.400 --> 40:01.400
Ah

40:01.400 --> 40:02.400
Ah

40:02.400 --> 40:03.400
Next is

40:03.400 --> 40:04.400
The one I just mentioned

40:04.400 --> 40:05.400
Tolstien Hart

40:05.400 --> 40:06.400
He is

40:06.400 --> 40:07.400
He thinks

40:07.400 --> 40:09.400
Nobel Prize should be given to him

40:09.400 --> 40:10.400
Why didn't you give it to him

40:10.400 --> 40:12.400
He also wrote a letter to protest

40:12.400 --> 40:13.400
Anyway

40:13.400 --> 40:14.400
He is still very passionate

40:14.400 --> 40:15.400
He is

40:16.400 --> 40:17.400
In that

40:18.400 --> 40:20.400
In a meteorite pit in Russia

40:20.400 --> 40:22.400
Found the so-called natural dodecahedron

40:22.400 --> 40:24.400
This is a picture of a high-density

40:24.400 --> 40:26.400
You can see a very beautiful one

40:26.400 --> 40:28.400
A pattern of a dodecahedron

40:28.400 --> 40:29.400
Uh

40:29.400 --> 40:32.400
I just talked to Sol

40:32.400 --> 40:33.400
He still says

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
We were 45

40:35.400 --> 40:36.400
45 years ago

40:36.400 --> 40:38.400
You can find the dodecahedron

40:38.400 --> 40:39.400
It must be in the universe

40:39.400 --> 40:41.400
Tell us what the message is

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
Is it

40:42.400 --> 40:43.400
Dodecahedron is a

40:43.400 --> 40:45.400
A very common state in the universe

40:45.400 --> 40:46.400
But if you finish watching

40:46.400 --> 40:47.400
Just introduced the dodecahedron

40:47.400 --> 40:49.400
How did it come out

40:49.400 --> 40:51.400
You should be able to understand

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
Actually in the process of falling like this in the meteorite pit

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
It's a little bit like

40:54.400 --> 40:55.400
After melting quickly

40:55.400 --> 40:56.400
Quickly cool

40:56.400 --> 40:58.400
That is, it happens to be very likely

40:58.400 --> 40:59.400
A substance that will produce this

40:59.400 --> 41:00.400
I think it's pretty reasonable

41:00.400 --> 41:01.400
But

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
I also think he's right

41:02.400 --> 41:03.400
If we can

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
Understand whether the dodecahedron is in the universe

41:05.400 --> 41:06.400
Very stable

41:06.400 --> 41:07.400
Maybe for the future

41:07.400 --> 41:09.400
Application is a great help

41:10.400 --> 41:12.400
That may be in recent years

41:12.400 --> 41:13.400
In the dodecahedron

41:13.400 --> 41:15.400
A part that everyone pays more attention to

41:15.400 --> 41:17.400
Mainly in that

41:17.400 --> 41:18.400
In the dodecahedron

41:18.400 --> 41:20.400
Some of its special physical properties

41:20.400 --> 41:21.400
That includes

41:21.400 --> 41:23.400
I have found this

41:23.400 --> 41:26.400
Eterbium in that

41:26.400 --> 41:27.400
Quasi-crystal

41:27.400 --> 41:29.400
Uh, in the dodecahedron

41:29.400 --> 41:30.400
That one

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
Uh

41:32.400 --> 41:33.400
Additive ratio

41:33.400 --> 41:35.400
Then another one is

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
Magnetic connection

41:36.400 --> 41:38.400
Its magnetic and

41:38.400 --> 41:39.400
Magnetic connection

41:39.400 --> 41:40.400
It's also found in the dodecahedron

41:40.400 --> 41:42.400
And then there's the so-called

41:42.400 --> 41:44.400
The superconductive

41:44.400 --> 41:46.400
It's usually oxidized dodecahedron

41:46.400 --> 41:47.400
Superconductive

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
Then we are in a very low temperature

41:49.400 --> 41:50.400
Someone found a simple dodecahedron

41:50.400 --> 41:51.400
You can also find this thing

41:51.400 --> 41:52.400
Is that in the future we can also start

41:52.400 --> 41:53.400
The so-called

41:53.400 --> 41:55.400
In their research

41:55.400 --> 41:56.400
Use that so-called

41:56.400 --> 41:57.400
The dodecahedron and the dodecahedron

41:57.400 --> 41:58.400
Comparison together

41:58.400 --> 41:59.400
That is a

41:59.400 --> 42:00.400
Periodic

42:00.400 --> 42:01.400
A comparison of periodicity and periodicity

42:01.400 --> 42:03.400
Found this thing

42:03.400 --> 42:04.400
That's the last one

42:04.400 --> 42:05.400
I just talked about

42:05.400 --> 42:07.400
A product of our dodecahedron

42:07.400 --> 42:09.400
I'm not sure if I can see it

42:09.400 --> 42:10.400
That's the bottom

42:10.400 --> 42:12.400
This white part

42:12.400 --> 42:13.400
This is what we do

42:13.400 --> 42:14.400
A product of dodecahedron

42:14.400 --> 42:16.400
That we didn't add any oil

42:16.400 --> 42:18.400
I didn't add anything

42:18.400 --> 42:19.400
Just put the eggs on top

42:19.400 --> 42:20.400
Roasted

42:20.400 --> 42:21.400
Look at the top

42:21.400 --> 42:22.400
This

42:22.400 --> 42:24.400
The part of the oil has been covered

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
But the bottom is completely dry

42:28.400 --> 42:29.400
So we are doing dodecahedron now

42:29.400 --> 42:30.400
I hope

42:30.400 --> 42:32.400
There's no way to make a high-quality dodecahedron

42:32.400 --> 42:34.400
And then maybe in the near future

42:34.400 --> 42:36.400
Replace the dodecahedron as soon as possible

42:36.400 --> 42:38.400
In the entire national market

42:38.400 --> 42:40.400
Even in the shipping market

42:42.400 --> 42:44.400
This is what I did this year

42:44.400 --> 42:45.400
At the European conference

42:45.400 --> 42:47.400
We discussed a few questions

42:47.400 --> 42:48.400
We are not yet

42:48.400 --> 42:50.400
To discuss these things in depth

42:50.400 --> 42:52.400
But if you are interested in joining the dodecahedron in the future

42:52.400 --> 42:53.400
You can continue to do this

42:53.400 --> 42:54.400
Includes

42:54.400 --> 42:56.400
How to make a larger

42:56.400 --> 42:58.400
A better dodecahedron feed

42:58.400 --> 43:00.400
And then do a partial

43:00.400 --> 43:02.400
Electronic communication characteristics

43:02.400 --> 43:03.400
Exploration

43:03.400 --> 43:04.400
Because dodecahedron itself is a

43:04.400 --> 43:06.400
A lot of things

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
The other is

43:07.400 --> 43:09.400
This is the part that I didn't follow

43:09.400 --> 43:11.400
Is it

43:11.400 --> 43:13.400
Phenomenon or non-phenomenon

43:13.400 --> 43:15.400
There's really a phenomenon

43:15.400 --> 43:16.400
So we've been talking about

43:16.400 --> 43:17.400
Dodecahedron surface

43:17.400 --> 43:18.400
Dodecahedron surface

43:18.400 --> 43:19.400
But he really has

43:19.400 --> 43:20.400
This is

43:20.400 --> 43:22.400
Because we use a lot of dodecahedron models

43:22.400 --> 43:24.400
This thing is a

43:24.400 --> 43:25.400
In

43:25.400 --> 43:26.400
Mathematics may be more

43:26.400 --> 43:27.400
Challenging thing

43:27.400 --> 43:28.400
The last one is me

43:28.400 --> 43:29.400
I always feel like

43:29.400 --> 43:31.400
We should go find a

43:31.400 --> 43:33.400
New dodecahedron

43:33.400 --> 43:34.400
New dodecahedron

43:34.400 --> 43:35.400
Because now the dodecahedron is actually

43:35.400 --> 43:36.400
Relatively low melting point

43:36.400 --> 43:37.400
Since it's so good at high temperature

43:37.400 --> 43:38.400
We can't find

43:38.400 --> 43:39.400
A higher temperature dodecahedron

43:39.400 --> 43:41.400
This thing may be for the future

43:41.400 --> 43:43.400
Whether it's on the aircraft

43:43.400 --> 43:44.400
Or on the ship

43:44.400 --> 43:46.400
Will be better help

43:46.400 --> 43:48.400
Then I will make a concluding remark

43:48.400 --> 43:49.400
Is

43:49.400 --> 43:52.400
Yes, dodecahedron is the third kind of solid matter

43:52.400 --> 43:53.400
Then its thermal stability

43:53.400 --> 43:55.400
In fact, compared to the general

43:55.400 --> 43:56.400
High entropy

43:56.400 --> 43:58.400
Alloy or

43:58.400 --> 43:59.400
Amorphous

43:59.400 --> 44:01.400
It has better thermal stability

44:01.400 --> 44:02.400
That

44:03.400 --> 44:04.400
Dodecahedron

44:04.400 --> 44:06.400
It can be found in many nuclei

44:06.400 --> 44:08.400
And even in the universe

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
That

44:11.400 --> 44:12.400
The following is

44:12.400 --> 44:13.400
In fact, the most important thing is this

44:13.400 --> 44:14.400
How are we going to

44:14.400 --> 44:15.400
From dodecahedron

44:15.400 --> 44:16.400
We can understand

44:16.400 --> 44:18.400
What is the definition of a new structure

44:18.400 --> 44:19.400
Are we going to define it in three dimensions

44:19.400 --> 44:20.400
Or in

44:20.400 --> 44:21.400
Causing space to define it

44:21.400 --> 44:22.400
Or we can define it in six dimensions

44:22.400 --> 44:24.400
This is a very worthwhile question

44:24.400 --> 44:25.400
That's the last

44:25.400 --> 44:26.400
Thank you for listening

44:26.400 --> 44:28.400
Then we can take a look

44:28.400 --> 44:29.400
The picture on the right

44:29.400 --> 44:30.400
I chose

44:30.400 --> 44:31.400
The picture on the left is not very good

44:31.400 --> 44:32.400
I picked a little bit

44:32.400 --> 44:33.400
In fact, it looks like

44:33.400 --> 44:34.400
It looks like a dodecahedron

44:34.400 --> 44:35.400
But if we put

44:35.400 --> 44:36.400
After all the lines are drawn

44:36.400 --> 44:37.400
Will find

44:37.400 --> 44:38.400
Hey

44:38.400 --> 44:39.400
This thing is what we just saw

44:39.400 --> 44:40.400
That penrose pattern

44:40.400 --> 44:41.400
Is exactly the same

44:41.400 --> 44:43.400
So sometimes our eyes

44:43.400 --> 44:45.400
Can't see the real situation

44:45.400 --> 44:46.400
But electrons can be our eyes

44:46.400 --> 44:47.400
Let us see

44:47.400 --> 44:48.400
Hey

44:48.400 --> 44:50.400
What does the real atom look like

44:50.400 --> 44:51.400
That

44:51.400 --> 44:52.400
Today

44:52.400 --> 44:53.400
It's almost time

44:53.400 --> 44:54.400
Thank you all

44:54.400 --> 44:55.400
If you have any questions

44:55.400 --> 44:56.400
Welcome to discuss

45:01.400 --> 45:02.400
Applause

45:02.400 --> 45:04.400
Ok

45:04.400 --> 45:05.400
Hello everyone

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
Thank you

45:06.400 --> 45:07.400
Hey

45:09.400 --> 45:10.400
OK

45:10.400 --> 45:12.400
Is there anything you want to ask

45:12.400 --> 45:13.400
Any questions

45:13.400 --> 45:14.400
For those of you

45:18.400 --> 45:20.400
who want to know

45:21.400 --> 45:22.400
Hi

45:22.400 --> 45:23.400
Just

45:23.400 --> 45:24.400
Hello

45:24.400 --> 45:25.400
Well

45:25.400 --> 45:26.400
I want to know

45:26.400 --> 45:27.400
Is that you

45:27.400 --> 45:29.400
How do you define

45:29.400 --> 45:31.400
Its three-dimensional structure

45:31.400 --> 45:33.400
How do you define its

45:33.400 --> 45:34.400
Defects

45:34.400 --> 45:35.400
For example

45:35.400 --> 45:36.400
Dislocation

45:36.400 --> 45:37.400
Or stacking fault

45:37.400 --> 45:38.400
Or grain boundary

45:40.400 --> 45:41.400
Oh

45:41.400 --> 45:42.400
This thing

45:42.400 --> 45:43.400
Is

45:43.400 --> 45:45.400
In fact, we are now

45:45.400 --> 45:47.400
I don't know how to discuss

45:47.400 --> 45:48.400
Yes

45:48.400 --> 45:49.400
But

45:49.400 --> 45:51.400
This is the general whole

45:51.400 --> 45:53.400
A situation of actual atomic array

45:53.400 --> 45:54.400
In fact

45:54.400 --> 45:56.400
It is difficult for us to find a complete cut

45:56.400 --> 45:57.400
You see, it seems to be flat here

45:57.400 --> 45:58.400
It seems to be flat

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
But it's broken

46:01.400 --> 46:02.400
So we usually define

46:02.400 --> 46:03.400
When it comes to accuracy

46:03.400 --> 46:04.400
Let's look at that defect

46:04.400 --> 46:05.400
Look at this

46:07.400 --> 46:08.400
This two fat

46:08.400 --> 46:09.400
One is fat

46:10.400 --> 46:11.400
That rhombohedron

46:11.400 --> 46:13.400
And the other one is flatter

46:13.400 --> 46:14.400
That

46:14.400 --> 46:15.400
Hey

46:15.400 --> 46:16.400
Can I use the performance

46:16.400 --> 46:17.400
No

46:17.400 --> 46:18.400
Usually we

46:18.400 --> 46:20.400
When it comes to the defect of accuracy

46:20.400 --> 46:22.400
It's that the origin is always moving

46:22.400 --> 46:23.400
It's always changing

46:23.400 --> 46:24.400
But it's always

46:24.400 --> 46:25.400
The form of stable accuracy

46:25.400 --> 46:26.400
No matter how it alternates

46:26.400 --> 46:27.400
It's always

46:27.400 --> 46:29.400
A form of stable accuracy

46:29.400 --> 46:32.400
I'll give you an example of a cluster

46:32.400 --> 46:33.400
It's like

46:33.400 --> 46:35.400
It's got a very strong polarity

46:35.400 --> 46:36.400
It's a very strong polarity

46:36.400 --> 46:37.400
It's a very strong polarity

46:37.400 --> 46:39.400
How do we define dislocation

46:39.400 --> 46:40.400
It's actually a bit difficult

46:40.400 --> 46:41.400
But we can use it

46:41.400 --> 46:42.400
If

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400
If

46:43.400 --> 46:44.400
Hey

46:44.400 --> 46:45.400
Today

46:45.400 --> 46:47.400
One of the fatter things

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
This

46:49.400 --> 46:50.400
This thing

46:50.400 --> 46:53.400
It's a relatively big thing

46:53.400 --> 46:54.400
If it suddenly

46:54.400 --> 46:56.400
These two yellow ones go this way

46:56.400 --> 46:58.400
This green one goes this way

46:58.400 --> 47:01.400
We will only define such a defect

47:01.400 --> 47:03.400
We call it a defect of phasing

47:03.400 --> 47:06.400
So if it's dislocation or

47:06.400 --> 47:07.400
Uh

47:07.400 --> 47:09.400
Stack and fold

47:09.400 --> 47:12.400
We don't have a clear definition

47:25.400 --> 47:28.400
Hello

47:28.400 --> 47:29.400
Hello

47:35.400 --> 47:36.400
Hello

47:45.400 --> 47:46.400
Hello

47:46.400 --> 47:49.400
Hello

47:49.400 --> 47:52.400
Sorry, can I ask a question now?

47:52.400 --> 47:55.400
But the first one seems to be

48:00.400 --> 48:02.400
Hi, welcome

48:02.400 --> 48:05.400
Okay, so my question is actually very simple

48:05.400 --> 48:07.400
You just said

48:07.400 --> 48:09.400
Most of the clusters are in

48:09.400 --> 48:10.400
Intermetallic

48:10.400 --> 48:11.400
Found in the middle

48:11.400 --> 48:13.400
That's the reason

48:13.400 --> 48:15.400
Is there a possibility that

48:15.400 --> 48:17.400
Uh, for example, in oxidized materials

48:17.400 --> 48:18.400
Or other substances

48:18.400 --> 48:20.400
Found in clusters

48:20.400 --> 48:21.400
Oh

48:21.400 --> 48:23.400
In fact, this is also a very interesting topic

48:23.400 --> 48:24.400
In fact, in 2008

48:24.400 --> 48:26.400
A lot of people in that

48:26.400 --> 48:27.400
In the clusters

48:27.400 --> 48:29.400
Found the so-called seven symmetries

48:29.400 --> 48:31.400
With some special

48:31.400 --> 48:32.400
Inexplicable symmetries

48:32.400 --> 48:34.400
Do you have this?

48:34.400 --> 48:35.400
Yes

48:35.400 --> 48:37.400
But is it really so intermediate?

48:37.400 --> 48:39.400
We can go and see

48:43.400 --> 48:46.400
This pentagonal intermediate array

48:46.400 --> 48:48.400
It can be so full

48:48.400 --> 48:50.400
It's because it happens to be able to use two

48:50.400 --> 48:52.400
Symmetry to put it up

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
In fact, this

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
This pentagonal intermediate array

48:54.400 --> 48:56.400
It has many ways to fight

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
If you say

48:57.400 --> 49:00.400
Is it possible to happen in ceramics?

49:00.400 --> 49:01.400
But you have to think about ceramics

49:01.400 --> 49:04.400
It has a stronger

49:04.400 --> 49:06.400
So it might be more

49:06.400 --> 49:08.400
Forced to be in a certain

49:08.400 --> 49:10.400
In an agglomerated position

49:10.400 --> 49:11.400
So I'm not sure if it's going to form

49:11.400 --> 49:13.400
That kind of framework

49:13.400 --> 49:14.400
But if it's a high-density

49:14.400 --> 49:16.400
It's true that someone found out

49:18.400 --> 49:19.400
I don't seem to have answered the question

49:19.400 --> 49:20.400
Thank you

49:20.400 --> 49:22.400
Did I answer your question?

49:22.400 --> 49:23.400
Sorry

49:23.400 --> 49:25.400
No problem

49:25.400 --> 49:27.400
I'm just curious about the reason

49:27.400 --> 49:29.400
Because it's yours

49:29.400 --> 49:31.400
Is the size of your atom the same?

49:31.400 --> 49:35.400
Or is it related to the metal ring itself?

49:35.400 --> 49:37.400
You mean why?

49:37.400 --> 49:38.400
I don't quite understand what you mean

49:38.400 --> 49:39.400
You can talk about it again

49:39.400 --> 49:41.400
That's what you just said

49:41.400 --> 49:43.400
Your answer is more biased

49:43.400 --> 49:45.400
Just because your

49:45.400 --> 49:47.400
The size of the atom must be biased

49:47.400 --> 49:49.400
So it can fill this

49:49.400 --> 49:51.400
That's the edge

49:51.400 --> 49:53.400
Is that what you mean?

49:53.400 --> 49:55.400
No, because your atom is too big

49:55.400 --> 49:56.400
Just keep pushing it

49:56.400 --> 49:57.400
Push, push, push

49:57.400 --> 49:59.400
It doesn't necessarily push

49:59.400 --> 50:00.400
What you want

50:00.400 --> 50:02.400
But most importantly

50:02.400 --> 50:03.400
If the atom is too big

50:03.400 --> 50:04.400
It can't fit in at all

50:04.400 --> 50:05.400
We're going to put it in today

50:05.400 --> 50:07.400
In a specific space

50:07.400 --> 50:10.400
We

50:10.400 --> 50:12.400
In general, we have to say

50:12.400 --> 50:14.400
Because like here

50:14.400 --> 50:18.400
It has an atom

50:18.400 --> 50:19.400
Atomic Size Factor

50:19.400 --> 50:23.400
The size of the atom

50:23.400 --> 50:24.400
If this thing

50:24.400 --> 50:26.400
When the radius is too big

50:26.400 --> 50:27.400
It's a little bit

50:27.400 --> 50:29.400
It's going to form a very large force field

50:29.400 --> 50:30.400
This force field may make it

50:30.400 --> 50:33.400
The whole structure will collapse

50:33.400 --> 50:34.400
I see

50:34.400 --> 50:35.400
Like there's a fat guy

50:35.400 --> 50:37.400
There's a fat guy going to the cinema

50:37.400 --> 50:38.400
The people next to him were knocked over

50:38.400 --> 50:40.400
He just didn't feel well

50:40.400 --> 50:41.400
I see

50:41.400 --> 50:43.400
So how did he get sick?

50:43.400 --> 50:45.400
It's kind of like the law of physics

50:45.400 --> 50:46.400
Oh

50:48.400 --> 50:49.400
I see

50:49.400 --> 50:51.400
Then you have a

50:51.400 --> 50:54.400
What is the density of the atom

50:54.400 --> 50:56.400
Does this have anything to do with 1 and 3?

50:56.400 --> 50:58.400
Or

50:58.400 --> 51:00.400
1 and 3 themselves

51:00.400 --> 51:01.400
There is no absolute relationship

51:01.400 --> 51:03.400
Because this is actually the third point

51:03.400 --> 51:05.400
We got it from the experiment

51:05.400 --> 51:06.400
A

51:06.400 --> 51:08.400
Experienced

51:08.400 --> 51:09.400
If you look here

51:09.400 --> 51:11.400
It's true that we're in this kind of

51:11.400 --> 51:12.400
Green

51:12.400 --> 51:13.400
In the three-dimensional solution

51:13.400 --> 51:15.400
It will meet this condition

51:15.400 --> 51:16.400
But if you are in the second dimension

51:16.400 --> 51:17.400
Or some

51:17.400 --> 51:18.400
In the case of fractured orbit

51:18.400 --> 51:19.400
Or in

51:19.400 --> 51:21.400
It will have some

51:21.400 --> 51:22.400
It's a separate experience

51:22.400 --> 51:23.400
It's a separate experience

51:23.400 --> 51:25.400
But you have to meet three at the same time

51:25.400 --> 51:26.400
What's the second one?

51:26.400 --> 51:28.400
The second one is that the density can't be too big

51:28.400 --> 51:29.400
Otherwise, the atomic property will be too strong

51:29.400 --> 51:31.400
How to quantify too much

51:31.400 --> 51:32.400
How to quantify too much

51:32.400 --> 51:33.400
It's really a good question

51:33.400 --> 51:35.400
Um

51:35.400 --> 51:36.400
In fact, we usually say

51:36.400 --> 51:39.400
Don't exceed

51:39.400 --> 51:42.400
Density of 20% or more

51:42.400 --> 51:43.400
1 and 3 is also the density

51:43.400 --> 51:44.400
No, the second one is the density

51:44.400 --> 51:46.400
The second one is the density

51:46.400 --> 51:48.400
I thought it was some kind of formula

51:48.400 --> 51:49.400
In fact, I also want to say

51:49.400 --> 51:51.400
We've been discussing it before

51:51.400 --> 51:53.400
Right right right

51:58.400 --> 51:59.400
Hi

52:02.400 --> 52:03.400
Oh, I see someone

52:03.400 --> 52:04.400
I'm here

52:04.400 --> 52:05.400
Um

52:05.400 --> 52:07.400
Decagonal products are less

52:07.400 --> 52:08.400
Is there any reason?

52:08.400 --> 52:10.400
Because I only listed it today

52:10.400 --> 52:12.400
Um

52:12.400 --> 52:14.400
Stable

52:14.400 --> 52:15.400
Oxide crystal

52:15.400 --> 52:17.400
So decagonal is less

52:17.400 --> 52:19.400
Because most of the decagonal

52:19.400 --> 52:21.400
It's more like

52:21.400 --> 52:22.400
Metastable

52:22.400 --> 52:25.400
It's a stable state

52:25.400 --> 52:26.400
That

52:26.400 --> 52:28.400
In fact, we have been discussing in the past few years

52:28.400 --> 52:29.400
One of the more important points is that

52:29.400 --> 52:31.400
We know how to make stable accuracy

52:31.400 --> 52:33.400
We know how to make stable accuracy

52:33.400 --> 52:35.400
But we still don't know

52:35.400 --> 52:37.400
Why is the accuracy stable?

52:37.400 --> 52:39.400
What is its origin?

52:39.400 --> 52:40.400
We still can't design

52:40.400 --> 52:43.400
A better experiment to verify

52:43.400 --> 52:45.400
Why is the accuracy stable?

52:54.400 --> 52:56.400
Sorry to go back to that question

52:56.400 --> 52:58.400
You said that you still can't determine

52:58.400 --> 53:00.400
Why is the accuracy stable?

53:00.400 --> 53:02.400
From this point, there is no way to do

53:02.400 --> 53:04.400
DFT or quantum chemistry

53:05.400 --> 53:07.400
Go from the structure of the generation

53:07.400 --> 53:09.400
Or the electrical structure to understand

53:09.400 --> 53:11.400
Why is it stable?

53:11.400 --> 53:13.400
Oh, I think this question is good

53:13.400 --> 53:14.400
But usually we have to do DFT

53:14.400 --> 53:16.400
Or when you do this

53:16.400 --> 53:17.400
We have a very important thing

53:17.400 --> 53:19.400
Your wave function must have periodicity

53:19.400 --> 53:20.400
but

53:20.400 --> 53:23.400
Yes, yes, periodic boundary conditions

53:23.400 --> 53:24.400
Yes, yes, yes, yes

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
But the accuracy, it has a periodicity

53:26.400 --> 53:27.400
This accurate periodicity

53:27.400 --> 53:29.400
It's a magnetic fraction

53:29.400 --> 53:31.400
So you can't do DFT

53:31.400 --> 53:32.400
But we are also in the current stage

53:32.400 --> 53:33.400
There are some advanced ways to do

53:33.400 --> 53:35.400
We put the accuracy

53:35.400 --> 53:37.400
In a specific cubic structure

53:37.400 --> 53:39.400
It will be very similar

53:39.400 --> 53:41.400
It has a very similar symmetry

53:41.400 --> 53:44.400
You can do it in this case

53:44.400 --> 53:47.400
But so why is it actually a magnetic fraction

53:47.400 --> 53:50.400
It's easier to find than accuracy

53:50.400 --> 53:52.400
A lot of people have been like this recently

53:52.400 --> 53:53.400
Yes

53:53.400 --> 53:56.400
Then if it's because like DFT

53:56.400 --> 53:59.400
Periodic boundary conditions are very important

53:59.400 --> 54:02.400
What if it's a quantum chemistry method?

54:02.400 --> 54:03.400
For example, Gaussian

54:03.400 --> 54:06.400
Or it doesn't need periodic boundary conditions

54:06.400 --> 54:07.400
It is directly

54:07.400 --> 54:08.400
It's not using pseudo-potential

54:08.400 --> 54:11.400
It is directly using the real atomic orbital

54:11.400 --> 54:15.400
Then calculate some of its

54:15.400 --> 54:18.400
It's the electromagnetic wave function

54:18.400 --> 54:22.400
It does not consider the periodic brogue wave

54:22.400 --> 54:25.400
Oh

54:25.400 --> 54:26.400
Because of this part

54:26.400 --> 54:27.400
I didn't follow it so carefully

54:27.400 --> 54:29.400
We can discuss it in private later

54:29.400 --> 54:30.400
Okay, thank you

54:30.400 --> 54:31.400
I think this is quite interesting

54:31.400 --> 54:33.400
But I remember someone did it

54:33.400 --> 54:35.400
But it seems like I'm not sure

54:35.400 --> 54:37.400
I might have to go back and look at the information

54:37.400 --> 54:39.400
Because I remember someone did it

54:46.400 --> 54:48.400
Can I ask a question?

54:48.400 --> 54:50.400
Please say

54:50.400 --> 54:51.400
I want to ask

54:51.400 --> 54:54.400
I remember

54:54.400 --> 54:55.400
Linus Pauling

54:55.400 --> 54:58.400
He had a big argument before

54:58.400 --> 54:59.400
That is to say

54:59.400 --> 55:03.400
This quantum or an approximate

55:03.400 --> 55:09.400
Will all produce a similar electromagnetic brogue wave

55:09.400 --> 55:10.400
Yes

55:10.400 --> 55:14.400
How do you actually distinguish these two things?

55:14.400 --> 55:16.400
Ta-da

55:18.400 --> 55:21.400
In fact, the main thing is

55:21.400 --> 55:26.400
When the quantum is in the inner circle

55:26.400 --> 55:27.400
There must be

55:27.400 --> 55:31.400
For example, if we see a pentagon here

55:31.400 --> 55:34.400
There will be a negative pentagon inside

55:34.400 --> 55:37.400
But we see a pentagon here

55:37.400 --> 55:41.400
But it's a cubic structure inside

55:41.400 --> 55:46.400
This is the main thing we can see on the diffraction pattern

55:46.400 --> 55:52.400
Quasi-crystal and approximate difference

55:52.400 --> 55:53.400
This is because now

55:53.400 --> 55:54.400
If we can make better feed

55:54.400 --> 55:57.400
Or better electronic microscope resolution

55:57.400 --> 55:58.400
I can see it

55:58.400 --> 56:00.400
After all, like the earlier

56:00.400 --> 56:03.400
If you take this pattern

56:03.400 --> 56:04.400
You will find that you can see it

56:04.400 --> 56:07.400
But its spots are not so beautiful

56:07.400 --> 56:09.400
What did he just ask you?

56:09.400 --> 56:11.400
Quasi-crystal and approximate

56:11.400 --> 56:12.400
Linus Pauling

56:12.400 --> 56:14.400
He argued at that time

56:14.400 --> 56:19.400
If I put some specific pentagons in the cubic

56:19.400 --> 56:21.400
Then make a double gold

56:21.400 --> 56:24.400
I will get the same 10-fold diffraction pattern

56:24.400 --> 56:26.400
But the two structures

56:26.400 --> 56:30.400
The folding is different

56:30.400 --> 56:31.400
But its periodic is different

56:31.400 --> 56:35.400
So they must have different symmetry

56:35.400 --> 56:38.400
Or you can just look at this diffraction pattern

56:38.400 --> 56:40.400
Yes, so these two pictures show

56:40.400 --> 56:42.400
It's the difference on the diffraction pattern

56:42.400 --> 56:43.400
Should be able to distinguish

56:43.400 --> 56:44.400
Yes, yes, yes

56:44.400 --> 56:46.400
Now it's easier to distinguish

56:46.400 --> 56:48.400
It was harder at that time

56:48.400 --> 56:49.400
And the most important thing is

56:49.400 --> 56:51.400
There is no stable crystalline at that time

56:51.400 --> 56:54.400
So it will be an argument point

56:54.400 --> 56:58.400
Oh, there is another follow-up question

56:58.400 --> 57:02.400
That is, has anyone tried to do it under low temperature

57:02.400 --> 57:04.400
Similar structural analysis

57:04.400 --> 57:06.400
Because in this case

57:06.400 --> 57:10.400
You are less affected by the phaseon

57:10.400 --> 57:11.400
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

57:11.400 --> 57:14.400
This is someone doing this thing

57:14.400 --> 57:18.400
Because I'm not following the low temperature side

57:18.400 --> 57:20.400
Just look at its physics

57:20.400 --> 57:22.400
So if you are interested in this

57:22.400 --> 57:23.400
We can also discuss it in person

57:23.400 --> 57:25.400
I didn't follow so much

57:25.400 --> 57:28.400
But I'm sure someone is doing this part

57:28.400 --> 57:31.400
OK, thank you

57:33.400 --> 57:36.400
I want to know about its electricity

57:36.400 --> 57:39.400
That's why you just said

57:39.400 --> 57:43.400
This thing is actually more like a semiconductor

57:43.400 --> 57:44.400
Yes

57:44.400 --> 57:46.400
Then why is it

57:46.400 --> 57:48.400
It looks like metal added

57:48.400 --> 57:49.400
Why does it become a semiconductor

57:49.400 --> 57:51.400
Generally, metal is added casually

57:51.400 --> 57:53.400
It won't be like this if you participate in a magazine

57:53.400 --> 57:54.400
Yes

57:54.400 --> 57:57.400
This is also why crystalline is so interesting

57:57.400 --> 58:00.400
Usually we can have a few points to think about

58:00.400 --> 58:01.400
Because it's actually a bit complicated

58:01.400 --> 58:03.400
The first one is that it contains

58:03.400 --> 58:05.400
Posi-periodicity

58:05.400 --> 58:07.400
Will it cause its electronic

58:07.400 --> 58:10.400
Frequency

58:10.400 --> 58:12.400
Let's say we consider today

58:13.400 --> 58:15.400
In micro-spatial motion

58:15.400 --> 58:17.400
Its posi-periodicity

58:17.400 --> 58:19.400
It will make its wave function

58:19.400 --> 58:22.400
There will be a lot of destructive interference

58:22.400 --> 58:24.400
It can't transmit very well

58:24.400 --> 58:25.400
But at high temperature

58:25.400 --> 58:26.400
Is it because of this energy

58:26.400 --> 58:28.400
Because of pseudo-gap C

58:28.400 --> 58:29.400
There is a second point

58:29.400 --> 58:30.400
This point is one of them

58:30.400 --> 58:32.400
The second point I think is more common

58:32.400 --> 58:34.400
Because pseudo-gap itself

58:34.400 --> 58:37.400
It's an energy state that can only be seen by electrons

58:37.400 --> 58:40.400
In fact, when I was doing X-ray recently

58:40.400 --> 58:42.400
Because the resolution is not enough

58:42.400 --> 58:44.400
You have actually found some special phenomena recently

58:44.400 --> 58:46.400
But there is no way to see the pseudo-gap

58:46.400 --> 58:47.400
Did it actually change

58:47.400 --> 58:49.400
When this temperature rises

58:49.400 --> 58:52.400
This temperature dependence will make

58:52.400 --> 58:54.400
Electrons jump through this pseudo-gap

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
So it makes the oscillation better

58:55.400 --> 58:57.400
This is also one of the main reasons

58:59.400 --> 59:01.400
Wait a minute, can you explain

59:01.400 --> 59:04.400
Why is there a pseudo-gap in this thing?

59:04.400 --> 59:06.400
How did the pseudo-gap come

59:07.400 --> 59:11.400
Is this the same thing as the pseudo-gap of superconductivity?

59:12.400 --> 59:14.400
Sorry, let me think about it again

59:15.400 --> 59:17.400
The word pseudo-gap

59:17.400 --> 59:22.400
It's usually a word that appears in high-temperature superconductors

59:26.400 --> 59:28.400
You just found a gap

59:28.400 --> 59:30.400
So you call it pseudo-gap

59:32.400 --> 59:33.400
You can say that

59:33.400 --> 59:34.400
But in fact, this pseudo-gap

59:34.400 --> 59:36.400
The most important thing is that

59:36.400 --> 59:38.400
When we stabilize the crystallized compound

59:38.400 --> 59:40.400
The so-called

59:40.400 --> 59:42.400
Because we went to see the bandgap structure

59:42.400 --> 59:44.400
In fact, it is

59:48.400 --> 59:50.400
What is the combination?

59:50.400 --> 59:52.400
I forgot

59:52.400 --> 59:54.400
Anyway, its gap

59:54.400 --> 59:58.400
The most important thing is that it has something to do with Fermi sphere

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.400
We found that the pseudo-gap

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.400
Do you think it has anything to do with high-temperature superconductivity?

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
I don't think it doesn't matter

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.400
Because we are now

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400
Because I'm not doing this specifically

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.400
But the author will usually mention

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.400
I only know the reason for the pseudo-gap

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.400
But I don't know

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.400
Does it have anything to do with the pseudo-gap of high-temperature superconductivity?

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.400
Your pseudo-gap refers to

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400
The pseudo-gap in the bandgap structure

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400
OK

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400
In its structure

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.400
There is a gap in the bandstructure

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
Yes, there is a low energy point

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400
OK

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.400
So it actually

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.400
Anyway, you said

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400
Anyway, the result of the calculation

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.400
There is a gap

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400
So it looks like

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400
It's a bit like a semiconductor

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400
How big is the gap?

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400
How big is the gap?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400
Because each is not the same

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400
And in fact, the pseudo-gap of high-temperature superconductivity cannot be calculated

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.400
What I just said

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400
The so-called pseudo-gap is all from the near-term solution

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.400
How much is the near-term result?

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.400
I didn't remember this

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.400
I'll send you the data later

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400
This is quite interesting

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.400
Sorry, I just talked about

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400
You talked about the pseudo-gap

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400
This should be able to use

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400
Apex to measure

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400
You can measure the bandstructure

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400
I really want to measure it, but I have no chance

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400
Because

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400
As you said, the pseudo-gap cannot be calculated

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400
In fact, the best way is to use Apex

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400
But

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400
I think if there is a chance to make better data

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400
It is indeed a point to try

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400
Because I recently found

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400
The pn-reverse phenomenon in the pseudo-gap

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.400
This phenomenon may be with

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400
Because its structure has not changed at all

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.400
But its

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.400
Eoverlay has not changed

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400
But it has a very obvious pn-transition

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400
So

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400
If you can use Apex, please tell me

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400
No, no way

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400
I really want to do it

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.400
Because I think

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400
Because there is no way to do it directly

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.400
Apex usually can only measure

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.400
Measure the valence band, right?

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400
You can tell me

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.400
To be honest

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.400
I have never done Apex

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.400
I saw a lot of

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400
Data is

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400
Bandstructure

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400
Apex seems to be able to measure

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400
I'm not very sure

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400
Because I don't have it

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.400
Usually need to move

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400
I see

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400
So you can see this thing

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.400
Yes

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.400
But

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400
In fact, it is not very accurate

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.400
Because of the problem of feed processing

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400
If you don't do it very well

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400
Just for reference

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.400
I see

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400
Can this material be used for doping?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400
This question is really good

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400
Because we thought about it before

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400
Try to do doping

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.400
But you know

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.400
This thing is already three-dimensional

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.400
If you do doping

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.400
The structure may be broken, it will be too complicated

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.400
Someone wanted to say before

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400
This structure looks like a lot of defects

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.400
Is it possible to put cyan in it?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400
It's not really doping

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.400
But it's a new material

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.400
But after entering, you will find that its structure will collapse

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.400
So now we are less

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400
Really do doping

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400
Is it really doping?

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400
Is also a problem

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400
Because you can't make it go very smoothly

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400
There is too much difference in each place

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400
Then the second point is

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.400
If we talk about doping

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.400
We will only use substitution at most

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400
Maybe substitution

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.400
We assume to add a substitution

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.400
A certain element in the cluster

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400
To change its nature

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400
There is no way to do

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.400
Really do doping

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.400
Because the structure may collapse

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400
Is its doping

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400
More like BCS?

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400
Or is it exotic?

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400
Its doping is actually super bad

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400
Just have that phenomenon

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400
It just found this phenomenon

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.400
There is no breakthrough in the weather

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.400
Just because it doesn't

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.400
Interfere with anything

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400
But I saw this phenomenon

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.400
But the temperature is super low

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.400
So there is no application value

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400
But it's interesting to study

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.400
Why don't we use anything

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400
It has this feature

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400
Most of the metal

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.400
Will have BCS doping

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.400
Yes, that's right

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.400
So this thing

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.400
I'm curious about this thing

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400
Because it's metal

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.400
So it may be a BCS doping

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.400
You said it looks like ceramic

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.400
Like semiconductor

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400
It may not be normal doping

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.400
Yes, it's not normal

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.400
It's not normal

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.400
They don't particularly study

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.400
Does it match BCS?

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.400
They are just mentioning a phenomenon

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.400
Because if it can be mentioned

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.400
It should not only be communication

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.400
So they just test it

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.400
Because like I just said

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.400
Our final challenge

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.400
How to make a better test

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.400
For a smaller area

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.400
Because what is it

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.400
It's really a little bit difficult

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.400
Because it's not that easy to control

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.400
You have to make a big one

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.400
A lot of phasing

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.400
A lot of defects

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.400
It's easy, but you have to do it

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400
It's a little bit difficult

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.400
Do you have any other questions?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.400
Okay, let's thank Zong

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400
For bringing us a wonderful speech

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.400
And a great Q&A

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400
Thank you

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400
Thank you

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.400
If you have any questions

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.400
If you are really interested in BCS

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.400
Because my speech is not very good

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.400
If you are interested

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400
You can come back to me

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400
I think

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.400
It's a little bit difficult

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.400
Because it's a little bit difficult

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.400
If you are interested

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.400
You can come back to me

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.400
I think it makes me think a lot of questions

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.400
I hope everyone

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.400
If you are interested

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.400
You can join this field

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.400
You see so many people in front

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.400
Cosmology

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.400
Actually it's ok

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.400
I will turn off the recording now
