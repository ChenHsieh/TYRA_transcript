00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Jason Hong.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm the host for today.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today, we're honored to have two postdocs from the Japanese Institute of理化學研究所, RIKEN.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
One is the founder of TAIRA, Ted Chang.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The other is Xu Chengxuan.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ted Chang is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Emerging Sciences.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
His research focuses on the interaction between light and light-emitting ions.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Chengxuan focuses on theory.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:16,000
His research focuses on the interaction between spin-orbital interaction and Latin geoliquid effects on nanostructure.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're honored to have them here today.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Today's topic is 2-Dimensional Electron Gas, 2DEC, Electronic and Application.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'd like to ask Ted Chang to introduce 2-Dimensional Electron Gas.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Can you hear me?

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Most of the audience is muted.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you have any questions, please turn on the microphone.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's a line on the right side of the screen, which means you're muted.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can also leave a comment in the chat box on the right.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hello, I'm Ted Chang.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Today I'm going to talk about 2DEC.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
2DEC stands for 2-Dimensional Electron Gas.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We use semiconductors to generate different heterostructure materials.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We can also do some interesting experiments by adding some processes.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Later on, Ted Chang will talk about how to use 2DEC to generate heterostructure materials.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm going to talk about how to generate 2DEC.

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We're going to talk about how to generate quantum dots.

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In quantum dots, we can trap a single electron.

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In this experiment, we're going to measure the direction of polarization of light.

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The result is a single electron.

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We can also generate entangled photons.

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is a technology that has been around for 20 years.

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We can generate entangled photons and spins.

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's talk about 2DEC.

33
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why do we want to enter 2DEC?

34
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In fact, in 3D life, the phenomenon is different in 2D.

35
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is a very special example.

36
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,000
In 2D space, it is not possible for an animal to live in 2D space.

37
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

38
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because this dog will be separated by its digestive tract.

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Dogs in 2D space are not likely to exist in 2D space.

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because the physical conditions in 2D space are different, there will be different phenomena.

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What method do we use to observe 2DEC?

42
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's talk about how 2DEC is generated.

43
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We will also introduce some basic characteristics of 2DEC.

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If we have different semiconductor materials, which phenomenon is the most important to characterize the good or bad of these materials?

45
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:35,000
From 2DEC, we will introduce how to control the production of electrons or even a single electron in the material.

46
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How does 2DEC interact with a single electron?

47
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is a diagram of 3 different materials.

48
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The left bottom corner is the material of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide.

49
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The band structure of these two materials is different.

50
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The band structure on the left is the material of gallium arsenide, and the band structure on the right is the material of aluminum gallium arsenide.

51
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When the two materials are stacked together, a quantum well is generated.

52
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:06,000
In the middle of the quantum well, the Fermi energy, which occupies the highest electromagnetic field, can be adjusted.

53
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The material of gallium arsenide can move freely in the 2D space.

54
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
At the same time, different materials can be used to make similar 2DEC.

55
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Later on, we will introduce gallium arsenide.

56
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In our lab, we are also working on silicon and silicon germanium, which are also heterostructures.

57
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
In this material, we will focus on the characteristics of gallium arsenide.

58
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The main thing is that we hope that its mobility is basically the higher the better.

59
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mobility is also related to a lot of things.

60
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Usually, the mean free path is very long, and the scheduling time is very short.

61
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In this material, we will focus on the phase coherence lab, which is the interaction between electrons.

62
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We hope that the interaction between electrons will be better and better.

63
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Of course, it is different for different materials.

64
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But basically, our main concern is mobility, mean free path, and scheduling time.

65
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Gallium arsenide is a very mature technology.

66
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now it can grow to tens of millions, which is no problem.

67
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Of course, there are many limitations in other materials.

68
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The impurities in the middle of each layer may not match.

69
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So in this aspect, its mobility will be reduced.

70
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
In contrast, its mean free path and scheduling time are not so good.

71
00:10:39,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Next, we will talk about how to use mature manufacturing technology to make special components from 2DEC.

72
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This picture looks very old.

73
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Indeed, this is a paper published in 1996.

74
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It uses gallium arsenide with a similar structure.

75
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So it has gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide, and gallium arsenide, which are different doping materials.

76
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It can add electrons up and down.

77
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So it has a dot in the middle, which is a 2D artificial atom.

78
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because its electrons can only be confined to this layer,

79
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
we used to think that our electronic architecture has a lot of S, P, and D domain.

80
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But it is S, P, D, and L in three-dimensional space.

81
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But in 2D, its S, P, D, and L, its orbital angular number is different.

82
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Because of the discovery of 2D artificial atom,

83
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:46,000
we created a periodic table for 2D artificial atoms.

84
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The elements in this table are very interesting.

85
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It is named after the person who discovered this phenomenon.

86
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Our group, Tarucha, is in the upper left corner of the periodic table.

87
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There are many famous people in this table.

88
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This is one of the researchers of Mariana Fermi.

89
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
In addition to using the H method to describe different elements,

90
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
there is another method that is commonly used now.

91
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It is to put an electrode on it.

92
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
For example, in 1988, they started to put an electrode on 2D.

93
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The current from the left to the right is a quantized conductance.

94
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
When passing through the channel, the wave function can only be confined to these directions.

95
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So the conductance is quantized.

96
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This is a picture of its side.

97
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
When you apply voltage to the electrode below,

98
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
the lower the voltage, the narrower the channel below.

99
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
At the same time, it also controls the height of the level.

100
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is how it produces quantized conductance.

101
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sorry, sometimes it doesn't work.

102
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, yes, quantized conductance.

103
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Next, we will slowly enter the topic.

104
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Recently, everyone has been discussing quantum computing.

105
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
How to use quantum dot or quantum confine in the direction of quantum,

106
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and how to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.

107
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This paper was written by Chen Xuanhui's boss in 1998.

108
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
How to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.

109
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Basically, the concept is that when we apply voltage to the electrode above,

110
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
there are some electrons below that can only stay in this area.

111
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is because it is confined to one end, so it is in quantum dot.

112
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.

113
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Apply different voltages to the gate in the middle,

114
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
so that the interaction between electrons becomes stronger or weaker.

115
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So that it has the effect of exchange.

116
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Next, let's move on to my real experiment.

117
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is our dilution fridge.

118
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Our components are placed on a chip on the dilution fridge.

119
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The real size is about 1cm x 1cm.

120
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
As long as you apply voltage to the electrode above,

121
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
you can control the production of quantum dot.

122
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
For example, this is an SEM graph.

123
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The quantum dot produced here is produced in the electrode confined here.

124
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Its size is about 100nm.

125
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
In addition to producing double quantum dot,

126
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the same device can also produce single quantum dot.

127
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
When the voltage in the middle is not so high,

128
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the whole space can let the electrons stay in the middle.

129
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
In this place, we can measure its conductance.

130
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It is like a horizontal line.

131
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
When the voltage in the middle increases,

132
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it produces a stability diagram.

133
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Next, I will talk about how our experiment is going.

134
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The optical part is producing entangled photons in the left half of the graph.

135
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Entangled photons are basically two different nonlinear crystals.

136
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
One is producing double quantum dot,

137
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and the other is producing entangled photons.

138
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
When we measure the polarization of the photon on one side,

139
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
we measure the spin of the electron on the other side.

140
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Is the electron spinning up or down?

141
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This is a work from five years ago.

142
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
When a single electron is produced,

143
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it is related to the direction of polarization of the photon.

144
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
When you produce a circular polarization with different velocities,

145
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:19,000
it produces different traces of electrons.

146
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Next, we will talk about how to use the irradiated light

147
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
to produce a single electron.

148
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How do we measure the direction of the electron's spin?

149
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Next, we will measure the direction of the electron's spin from horizontal to spin up or vertical to spin down.

150
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This is to use the electron and hole pair produced.

151
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We use the light hole instead of the heavy hole.

152
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This method allows us to produce different spin directions from horizontal to vertical.

153
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How to do spin readout?

154
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We use a method called spin-to-charge conversion.

155
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We hope that the spin-up and spin-down are different.

156
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
How do we do this?

157
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
We use a phenomenon called Pauli Spin Blockade.

158
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If you know the Pauli Exclusion Principle,

159
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you will know that if the electron spins up or down on both sides,

160
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
it will not be able to move from the left to the right.

161
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This is our basic way of doing it.

162
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In the experiment, we let the quantum dot on the right have an electron.

163
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The blue star represents 0 and 1.

164
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
0 and 1 represent the charge state of different quantum dots.

165
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:30,000
When another electron is produced, it will enter 1 or 0.2.

166
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
If the electron is produced in the opposite direction,

167
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
it will spin left and right.

168
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
When the electron is produced in the opposite direction,

169
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
it will spin left and right.

170
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When the electron is produced in the opposite direction,

171
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
it will spin left and right.

172
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is how we measure the direction of single spin.

173
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.

174
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If it is in a different direction of spin,

175
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
its trace will be different.

176
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.

177
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.

178
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
How do we produce an entangled photon?

179
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is a very mature technology.

180
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Because the quantum dot moves,

181
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
the light in the two circles will move in the opposite direction.

182
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The light in the two circles will move in the opposite direction.

183
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
If you measure the polarization of the light in the two circles,

184
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If you measure the polarization of the light in the two circles,

185
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
it will be an entangled state.

186
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
it will be an entangled state.

187
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Next, we measure the light.

188
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Next, we measure the light.

189
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Next, we measure the light.

190
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:59,000
If the light receives the two signals at the same time,

191
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
it means that we have an entangled photon and an entangled spin.

192
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is the result of our experiment last year.

193
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It produces an entangled photon and an entangled spin.

194
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It produces an entangled photon and an entangled spin.

195
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This is the end of the main experiment.

196
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Here I explain how 2D Electron GANs is formed.

197
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Here I explain how 2D Electron GANs is formed.

198
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Usually, the quantum dot is produced differently.

199
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Some products are self-assembled quantum dots,

200
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
because the structure of the golden frame

201
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
has a defect, and this defect becomes a quantum dot.

202
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Compared to us, we use predetermined electrons

203
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
to apply different voltages to produce a single dot, a double dot.

204
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So these are very controllable things.

205
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Next, I will talk about how to measure the direction of the single electron.

206
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We will also talk about how to change the direction of the light

207
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
from a different bias to a different direction of the electron.

208
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Finally, we will talk about how to use the entangled photon

209
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
to produce different directions of the electron,

210
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and how to produce entangled photons and spin pairs.

211
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That's all for today.

212
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Our lab is the Quantum Functional System Research Group

213
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
at the Institute of Physics and Chemistry.

214
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Our main PI is Harucha,

215
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and we have other partners,

216
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
such as Chenxuan and Loss,

217
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and OIWA, a group from Osaka University.

218
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Our wafers are provided by a German school and organization.

219
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's all for today.

220
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Thank you.

221
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Thank you, Ted, for the wonderful talk.

222
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
If you have any questions,

223
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
please feel free to ask.

224
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If not, I will ask a question.

225
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You mentioned that mobility is very important.

226
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Where does mobility and phase coherence time affect quantum computing?

227
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Why are these properties important?

228
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Phase coherence time limits the size of the quantum dot.

229
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The phase coherence length and mean free path of a quantum dot

230
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
can reach tens of microns.

231
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The requirements for the process are less than 1 micron.

232
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Silicon is much smaller, about 10 times smaller.

233
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Therefore, it is more difficult for us to experiment or process.

234
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The size of the quantum dot must be at least 100 nanometers or less.

235
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What we are doing now is to control the electron in this area.

236
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
If there are still some phenomena in this area,

237
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
this is not ideal.

238
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Basically, mobility, mean free path, and phase coherence length

239
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
affect the size of the component process.

240
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Of course, there are different difficulties.

241
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
For example, if my SEM graph shows that

242
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
the size of a dot is about 200 to 300 nanometers.

243
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So a dot is about 200 nanometers or less.

244
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Silicon is super difficult to make, so it will be more difficult.

245
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But the Galien Arsenide you show has a coherence length of 40 microns.

246
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So even if you make it less than 40 microns,

247
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you can still make it.

248
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It doesn't matter if it's less than 1 micron.

249
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
1 micron is already very easy to make.

250
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Basically, photolithography can be done.

251
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Do you have any questions?

252
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We are very informal, so you can ask as many questions as possible.

253
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Hello, can you hear me?

254
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Can you hear me?

255
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I have a question.

256
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Do you know how long the coherence time can be less?

257
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What is the relaxation time after entanglement?

258
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
For electrons, it's very small.

259
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Because it's in the Galien Arsenide, it's about 100 nanoseconds.

260
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I see.

261
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So it's still limited by the time of entanglement.

262
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Basically, in the Galien Arsenide, there are many different nucleons.

263
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,000
These nucleons will interact with electrons.

264
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So it can be about a few hundred nanoseconds.

265
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
In the Galien Arsenide, it's very short.

266
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But in silicon, it's about 20 milliseconds.

267
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Because silicon can be purified,

268
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
silicon can be purified, and silicon can be purified.

269
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Thank you.

270
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Any other questions?

271
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,000
If not, let's invite Chenxuan to give the next speech.

272
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay, thank you.

273
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Hello, everyone.

274
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Can you see my slides now?

275
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes.

276
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Thank you, Jason.

277
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Thank you, Ted, for the invitation.

278
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
My name is Chenxuan Xu.

279
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.

280
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.

281
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.

282
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
In my research, I focus on spin-orbital coupling.

283
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So I'll start by introducing spin-orbital coupling in nanostructure.

284
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Then I'll talk about why we're interested in very strong spin-orbital coupling.

285
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then I'll talk about why we're interested in very strong spin-orbital coupling.

286
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
This is our recent theoretical research.

287
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
When you have a very strong spin-orbital coupling in nanowire,

288
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
what will happen to your charge transport, current, or inductance?

289
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay, let's start our introduction.

290
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
In nanostructure, we usually have inversion symmetry breaking.

291
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
These inversion symmetry breaking are equivalent to a circuit.

292
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
When electrons move in these inversion symmetry breaking,

293
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
there is a magnetic field in its inversion symmetry breaking.

294
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This magnetic field, of course, will be coupled with its spin coupling.

295
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
In our experimental inversion symmetry breaking,

296
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
it looks like its spin and momentum will be coupled.

297
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Because momentum is related to its orbital motion,

298
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
we call this coupling spin-orbital coupling.

299
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
In nanostructure, there are mainly two kinds of symmetry breaking.

300
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The first one is what Ted just introduced.

301
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because we're going to form two decks, we'll have some heterostructure.

302
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So in the z-direction, there's a magnetic field.

303
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This magnetic field will cause this spin-orbital coupling.

304
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Then we call it rush-button coupling.

305
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
In addition to this structure,

306
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
our material is usually made up of 3-5 sets of semiconductors.

307
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So in its crystal, there's usually inversion symmetry breaking.

308
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
This inversion symmetry breaking will give us another phase.

309
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We call it Dresselhaus turn.

310
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'll give you two examples.

311
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What kind of effect does this coupling have in nanostructure?

312
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
One of the effects is that

313
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
when we continue to confine this two-deck to a dot,

314
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
which is one of the applications Ted just talked about.

315
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Usually, after we form a common dot,

316
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
if we want to do some further spin qubits experiments,

317
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
we usually add a magnetic field.

318
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
We found that if you have a magnetic field

319
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
coupled with spin-orbital coupling,

320
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
you'll change the G-factor in the dot.

321
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The G-factor is important here

322
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
because it affects Zeeman splitting.

323
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Of course, it affects the nature of the dot electron.

324
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So we have a paper in our group

325
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
discussing this nature.

326
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's the effect.

327
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The second example is related to the topic I'm going to talk about today.

328
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If your two-deck later forms a wire,

329
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
usually your wire won't have...

330
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
your cross-section won't be zero.

331
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So you'll have some finite width.

332
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
This is the so-called quasi-1D.

333
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This is what I call quasi-1D.

334
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
In this case, we found that

335
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
spin-orbital coupling will form some

336
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
bend-distortion properties.

337
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm going to talk a little bit more about this.

338
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
First of all, in a common experiment,

339
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
we'll add some magnetic fields.

340
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So the situation I'm going to discuss next,

341
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the experiment is that

342
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
the launch button is far greater than the tracer host.

343
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So I'll just look at the launch button next.

344
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
In the case of quasi-1D,

345
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
we know that there will be kinetic energy

346
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
along the direction of the wire.

347
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So that's the term.

348
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
In the y-direction, I'll have some confinement.

349
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I can take this part of the energy spectrum quantized.

350
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So it's equivalent to this kind of energy splitting.

351
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So this is my sub-bend term.

352
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
The launch button will result in

353
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the mixing of these two parts.

354
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I just mentioned that

355
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the launch button spin-orbital coupling

356
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
can have these two terms.

357
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Let's look at the first term,

358
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
which is the term related to Kx.

359
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's related to the momentum along the wire.

360
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So the effect of this term is that

361
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
in the energy spectrum,

362
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
it splits the quadratic dispersion

363
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
of the upper and lower order.

364
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So there's this shift.

365
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
If I add the second term of

366
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
the launch button spin-orbital coupling,

367
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
this term will couple these two states

368
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
in this little green circle.

369
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So it splits the different sub-bends

370
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
with the opposite spin-orbital coupling.

371
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
If I add these two terms,

372
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll find that the energy spectrum

373
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
of my quantum wire will be distorted.

374
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This means that

375
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
if I have a Fermi energy here,

376
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
we'll find that the energy spectrum

377
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
of branch A and branch B,

378
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
which is the red and blue energy spectrum,

379
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the Fermi velocity will be different.

380
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So I call this bend-distortion.

381
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
This is another effect of

382
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the launch button spin-orbital coupling.

383
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Another one is that it may mix

384
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the upper and lower order.

385
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Mainly because of the spin-orbital coupling,

386
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
your spin is no longer a good quantum number.

387
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We have some simple calculations here.

388
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
The left side is the energy spectrum.

389
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
If I have a chemical potential,

390
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
assuming that the chemical potential

391
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
is slowly tuned from the bottom to the top,

392
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
the graph on the right is equivalent to

393
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
from left to right.

394
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
We're calculating the spin expectation value

395
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
of these four different states.

396
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We'll find that because of the spin-orbital coupling,

397
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
the spin will change with the chemical potential.

398
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
This is one effect.

399
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The second effect is what I just said.

400
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Because these two energy bands

401
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
have different velocities,

402
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
we can also calculate their velocities

403
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and find that they are also related to the chemical potential.

404
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Here is a brief introduction

405
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
of these effects.

406
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Now, I'd like to go back to the beginning

407
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and ask why we're interested in

408
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
spin-orbital coupling.

409
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
This question is equivalent to asking

410
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
why spin-orbital coupling is so important.

411
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Is it because it can be eaten?

412
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
If you're in Kalucha's group,

413
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
you'll find that they can make

414
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
a double nanowire cake.

415
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
If you're a good friend of their group,

416
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
you can eat this delicious double nanowire cake.

417
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But apart from being edible,

418
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the most important thing for us is

419
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that if you have spin-orbital coupling,

420
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
you can use it to achieve Majorna bond states.

421
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
This is a relatively popular material

422
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
in the field of spin-orbital coupling.

423
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Next, I'd like to introduce

424
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
what Majorna bond states are.

425
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
This is more than 80 years ago.

426
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Majorana was an Italian physicist.

427
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
He proposed that

428
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
in the Dirac equation,

429
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
there is a real solution.

430
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The solution is called Majorna fermions.

431
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
They are their own antimatter.

432
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The reason why we're interested in

433
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
condensers and solid-state physics

434
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
is because we later found that

435
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Majorna fermions may not be able to

436
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
or we may not be able to

437
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
verify that they are elementary particles.

438
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But they may be able to be realized

439
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
in solid-state physics,

440
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
especially in the last 10 years.

441
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The paper by Ulrich and Dasama

442
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
tells you that

443
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
if you want to achieve Majorna fermions,

444
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
you only need some easy-to-do setups.

445
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You just need some spin-orbital nanowires

446
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to achieve Majorna bond states.

447
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Because of the appearance of these two papers,

448
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
people started to notice

449
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
that we may be able to achieve Majorna bond states.

450
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Of course, Majorna bond states

451
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
are very popular.

452
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The other reason is that

453
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
they are thought to provide

454
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
some topological quantum computation.

455
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So you can use them to do quantum computing.

456
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
This is one of the reasons

457
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
why people are interested in them.

458
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Because of this nature,

459
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
you may be able to do quantum computation.

460
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
People want to know

461
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
if they can really do it.

462
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Let me introduce the most

463
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
well-known or

464
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
carefully studied setup,

465
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that is, using single-wire.

466
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
As I said, if you convert an electron

467
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
into a single-wire,

468
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
and if the material has a strong spin-orbital coupling,

469
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
for example,

470
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
you can use indium arsenide or indium montmorillonide.

471
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
As you know,

472
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
these materials have a strong spin-orbital coupling.

473
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
If you have these materials,

474
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and you add some magnetic field

475
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
along the direction of the wire,

476
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
basically,

477
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
you can have this effect.

478
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
If you have large-spin-orbital coupling,

479
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
as I said,

480
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
the dispersion will be shifted.

481
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
If you add another magnetic field,

482
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
it will open a Zeeman gap

483
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
at the zero-momentum point.

484
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
If your chemical potential

485
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is fine-tuned to this area,

486
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
you will have helical modes.

487
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Helical modes are the electrons

488
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
on the right and on the left

489
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
with different spin,

490
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
which is called helical modes.

491
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
If you put such a wire

492
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
on a superconductor,

493
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
you will find that

494
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
at the zero-momentum point,

495
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
the system gap is determined by two parameters.

496
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
One is the pairing gap,

497
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and the other is the Zeeman gap.

498
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
This means that you have two gap openings

499
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
competing against each other.

500
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Both gaps want to open,

501
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
but their opening signs are opposite.

502
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So the system gap

503
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
means that

504
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
if I put my wire on the superconductor,

505
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
my pairing gap will be fixed.

506
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
If I slowly open my magnetic field,

507
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
the system gap,

508
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
the gap of the entire energy spectrum,

509
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
will shrink,

510
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
and it will be closed at a certain point.

511
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
If I continue to open my magnetic field,

512
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
it will be reopened.

513
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Here we find a topological phase transition.

514
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
In this area on the right,

515
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
we find that the band is inversed.

516
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Because of this band inversion,

517
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
we find that in this area,

518
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
you can achieve Majorna bond state.

519
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You can see that

520
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the elements needed here

521
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
sound quite simple.

522
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
As long as you have a magnetic field,

523
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
a superconductor,

524
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and strong enough spin-over coupling,

525
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you can achieve Majorna bond state.

526
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It sounds quite convenient,

527
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
so we put a lot of effort

528
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
into studying this setup.

529
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But there is a difficulty.

530
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Because you need a magnetic field,

531
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
the magnetic field tends to disrupt the superconductor.

532
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
In other words,

533
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
your entire gap is usually affected by the magnetic field.

534
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
In other words,

535
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
your Majorna bond state

536
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
is usually in the middle of the gap.

537
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
The smaller the gap,

538
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
the weaker the protection.

539
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So you don't need a magnetic field.

540
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
This makes people,

541
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
especially those who do theoretical research,

542
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
wonder if there are other mechanisms.

543
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
As mentioned earlier,

544
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
we need the so-called gap opening

545
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to open the gap

546
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and achieve Majorna bond state.

547
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
If we look at it the other way around,

548
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
if we look at it the other way around,

549
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
before the pairing gap,

550
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
my energy spectrum

551
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is equivalent to

552
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a spin-selected gap in my energy spectrum.

553
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That is, the gap opening

554
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
between the upper and lower branches

555
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
is different in the momentum space.

556
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Is it possible

557
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
to have a spin-selected gap?

558
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
People later found out that

559
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
if you have a wire

560
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and feel the rotating magnetic field,

561
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
you can achieve a spin-selected gap.

562
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
you can achieve a spin-selected gap.

563
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
People later found out that

564
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
in the case of a single-wire,

565
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
the conduction electron has a so-called RKKY coupling.

566
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
This RKKY coupling

567
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
can achieve a very special spin order.

568
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
can achieve a very special spin order.

569
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
This spin will automatically

570
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
generate a rotating order.

571
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
This order can be used to achieve

572
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
the very special gap we just mentioned.

573
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
That is, if you have this RKKY system,

574
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That is, if you have this RKKY system,

575
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
you automatically have a spin-off coupling.

576
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
you automatically have a spin-off coupling.

577
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That is, you have a synthetic spin-off coupling.

578
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That is, you have a synthetic spin-off coupling.

579
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
If you put such a system on the super island,

580
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
you will have different competing mechanisms.

581
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
you will have different competing mechanisms.

582
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You can have band-inversion

583
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and you can achieve Myrna-Brown state.

584
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Our group also used a similar mechanism a while ago.

585
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Our group also used a similar mechanism a while ago.

586
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
We found that if you use carbon-13,

587
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
which is different from the usual carbon-12,

588
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
which is different from the usual carbon-12,

589
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
it will have nuclear spin.

590
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
If you use carbon-13 nanotube,

591
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
you will find that it will automatically generate this helix.

592
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
If you put this nanotube on the super island,

593
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
you can achieve Myrna-Brown state.

594
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Of course, there may also be different setups.

595
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Of course, there may also be different setups.

596
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
What we were doing a while ago was using higher-order TI.

597
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
What we were doing a while ago was using higher-order TI.

598
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
In this case, your material will have this so-called

599
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
gapless-hinged state.

600
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
We found that if you put the super conductor on the material,

601
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
We found that if you put the super conductor on the material,

602
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
you can achieve two different pairings.

603
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
One is the so-called non-local pairing,

604
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and the other is the local pairing.

605
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You can achieve Myrna-Brown state

606
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
because of the competition between these two different pairings.

607
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Today's topic is more related to

608
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
the so-called double nanowire setup.

609
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Today's topic is more related to

610
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
the so-called double nanowire setup.

611
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You put two nanowires on the super conductor.

612
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You put two nanowires on the super conductor.

613
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
There are two ways for the cooper pair to enter the nanowire.

614
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You can enter the same nanowire,

615
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
which is called local pairing.

616
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You can also enter different nanowires.

617
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Theoretically, you will find that

618
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
if you have non-local pairing greater than local pairing,

619
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
you can also achieve Myrna-Brown state.

620
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
This can explain our motivation.

621
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
This can explain our motivation.

622
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Basically, we want to know

623
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
that we can have some spin-octal coupling nanowires

624
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that we want to know that we can have some spin-octal coupling nanowires

625
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
that we can try to put on the super conductor.

626
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
How do we achieve this condition,

627
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
that is, non-local pairing greater than local pairing?

628
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
This is another theoretical study.

629
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
This is another theoretical study.

630
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
If your electronic interaction is strong enough,

631
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
you are likely to achieve this condition.

632
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The reason is that the electronic interaction here is the coolant.

633
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The reason is that the electronic interaction here is the coolant.

634
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So if your coolant is very strong,

635
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
it will try to split your cooper pair into different wires.

636
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
So if your coolant interaction is strong enough,

637
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
your non-local pairing will be greater than the local pairing.

638
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
your non-local pairing will be greater than the local pairing.

639
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Before trying to achieve these topological states,

640
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Before trying to achieve these topological states,

641
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
we would like to know that how could we reach

642
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
strong electronic interaction.

643
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Normal, the so-called

644
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
wired electronic interaction

645
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,880
is described with the Tomonaga-Latinger

646
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,880
or Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid.

647
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,880
In describing its model,

648
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,880
we will have a parameter called Gc.

649
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,880
So the point is that we want to know

650
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,880
how much Gc we can reach.

651
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,880
Let's review first.

652
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,880
If there is no spin-over coupling,

653
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,880
how do we determine the value of Gc in practice?

654
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,880
Here I simply write this Hamiltonian.

655
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,880
If there is no spin-over coupling,

656
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,880
the so-called Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid

657
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,880
will look like this.

658
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,880
There will be some bosonic fields

659
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,880
to describe the physics of low energy.

660
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,880
The most important thing is this Gnu.

661
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,880
Gnu is C or S,

662
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,880
which is the charge or spin sector.

663
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,880
The most important thing is that because of the coolant interaction,

664
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,880
there is no spin-over coupling.

665
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,880
The smaller the Gc, the stronger the spin-over coupling.

666
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,880
So we want to know

667
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,880
the value of Gc in this material.

668
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,880
How do we know?

669
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,880
As you can see in the document,

670
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,880
if you have a Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid,

671
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,880
your IV curve will look like this.

672
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,880
This IV curve

673
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,880
has a so-called universal scaling behavior.

674
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,880
What does it mean?

675
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,880
If you divide both sides

676
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,880
by the power load of the temperature,

677
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,880
you will find that the right side

678
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,880
is only related to V divided by T.

679
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,880
This V is the bias voltage,

680
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,880
and T is the temperature.

681
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,880
In other words, if you draw this picture,

682
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,880
you will find that all the bias and all the temperature

683
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,880
data points are all concentrated on the same line.

684
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,880
This is called universal scaling.

685
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,880
Because this scaling is related to this α,

686
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,880
and this α is related to this Gc,

687
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,880
so if you can fit this data,

688
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,880
you can find out how much Gc should be.

689
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,880
In this way, you can know

690
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,880
how strong the interaction of electrons in the guide line is.

691
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,880
Here's an example.

692
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,880
Tarucha's group

693
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,880
uses indium arsenide as a wire.

694
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,880
They first get a two-deck wafer,

695
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,880
and then continue to convert it into a wire.

696
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,880
This is what Ted mentioned earlier.

697
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,880
If you have these wires,

698
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,880
they continue to measure this IV curve

699
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,880
with the current to the bias voltage.

700
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,880
Different colors represent different temperatures,

701
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,880
and you find that the low data is like this.

702
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,880
But you can rescale it.

703
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,880
After rescaling, you will find that all the data points

704
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,880
are concentrated on this line.

705
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,880
So this tells us that there really is

706
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,880
the phenomenon of the so-called Tomonaga-Rattinger liquid in this guide line.

707
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,880
You can get this α from this fitting.

708
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,880
They continue to tune

709
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,880
different top gate voltages.

710
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,880
That is, it can adjust the charge density in the guide line.

711
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,880
You find different densities.

712
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,880
The low data you get is like this.

713
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,880
Then you can go to fit

714
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,880
and find the phenomenon of universal scaling.

715
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,880
Their data is very beautiful.

716
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,880
In other words,

717
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,880
not only do you know that

718
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,880
there is universal scaling in this line,

719
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,880
there is Tomonaga-Rattinger liquid,

720
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,880
you also know that you can tune

721
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,880
the strength of the electron interaction.

722
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,880
Here is the value of their fit α

723
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,880
and the top gate voltage.

724
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,880
So the first conclusion here is that

725
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,880
you can have a tunable electron interaction.

726
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,880
The second is that your α

727
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,880
is about 2.5.

728
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,880
How do we know

729
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,880
what the value is when it is converted to Gc?

730
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,880
The most important question here is

731
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,880
because we know that the spin-over coupling of indium arsenide is very strong.

732
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,880
What we found in the file before

733
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,880
is that there is no spin-over coupling formula.

734
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,880
So we want to know that if you add spin-over coupling,

735
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,880
this formula will be changed.

736
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,880
So how do we know

737
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,880
what our real Gc is?

738
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,880
So this brings us to our research this time.

739
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,880
Because of the time,

740
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,880
I will briefly introduce it.

741
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,880
In the case of Bostonization,

742
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,880
the introduction mentioned that

743
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,880
you have the phenomenon of band distortion,

744
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,880
which is ΔV.

745
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,880
If you have a Hamiltonian,

746
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,880
it will produce a new term.

747
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,880
This new term is quadratic,

748
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,880
so you can still diagonalize it.

749
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,880
Then you can get the full Hamiltonian.

750
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,880
Because this full Hamiltonian

751
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,880
can still be directly solved,

752
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,880
we can still use it to calculate

753
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,880
our current or inductance.

754
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,880
Then we will consider two extremes.

755
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,880
That is, impurity,

756
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,880
that is, there will be different impurities in this inductance.

757
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,880
These impurities will cause

758
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,880
your electron to backscatter.

759
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,880
So this will affect your current or inductance.

760
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,880
We consider two extremes.

761
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,880
One is when this impurity is very strong.

762
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,880
If it is very strong,

763
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,880
there will be a tunnel barrier.

764
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,880
Then we find that if your tunnel barrier

765
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,880
is in the end of the inductance and the middle of the inductance,

766
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,880
you will have different scaling exponents.

767
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,880
So in these two different situations,

768
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,880
we find that

769
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,880
you can still get a similar form,

770
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,880
which is this IV curve.

771
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,880
It looks the same as the formula

772
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,880
The only difference is that this α will be changed.

773
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,880
Then we find that this α will be related to

774
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,880
where your impurity is.

775
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,880
Then it is also related to the bend distortion

776
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,880
caused by spin-orbital coupling.

777
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,880
This is its formula.

778
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,880
Let's summarize the results in this picture.

779
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,880
Let's summarize the results in this picture.

780
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,880
In this picture,

781
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,880
I first draw the whole exponent

782
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,880
without spin-orbital coupling.

783
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,880
It looks like this.

784
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,880
That is to say, the stronger your electromagnetic interaction force,

785
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,880
that is, Gc is close to zero,

786
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,880
the greater your exponent.

787
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,880
On the contrary, if Gc is 1,

788
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,880
that is, if there is no electromagnetic interaction force,

789
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,880
your α will become zero.

790
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,880
This is the effect of spin-orbital coupling.

791
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,880
We find that it affects

792
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,880
the strong electromagnetic interaction force.

793
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,880
In fact, this effect is very small

794
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,880
because it is very small compared to the original exponent.

795
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,880
That is to say, if there is a strong electromagnetic interaction force

796
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,880
in your導線,

797
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,880
you don't have to worry about whether spin-orbital coupling is strong or not.

798
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,880
Because it doesn't really affect

799
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,880
the opposite area.

800
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,880
If your electromagnetic interaction force is weak,

801
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,880
you will indeed see some changes.

802
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,880
We found that the changes here are negative.

803
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,880
That is to say, your exponent looks

804
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,880
smaller than it was without spin-orbital coupling.

805
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,880
So these features tell us

806
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,880
that when your experiment has measured

807
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,880
that your α is quite high value,

808
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,880
it can be said that your electron-electron

809
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,880
display is very strong.

810
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,880
This is our main conclusion.

811
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,880
Of course, we just said that we can consider different limits.

812
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,880
Your impurity can be very strong.

813
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,880
This is the conclusion we just got.

814
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,880
Your impurity can also be very weak.

815
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,880
If it is very weak, we are not tunnel barrier.

816
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,880
In this case, we consider a lot of

817
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,880
weak impurities.

818
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,880
Then we get a similar formula.

819
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,880
The difference is that the exponent will be different.

820
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,880
We found that if we take this exponent

821
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,880
to draw this picture,

822
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,880
we will find that the big difference

823
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,880
is that the exponent will only go to 1 at most.

824
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,880
That is, it will be limited between 0 and 1.

825
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,880
So the 2.5 we saw in the experiment

826
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,880
cannot be explained by this weak impurity.

827
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,880
So we can rule it out.

828
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,880
So we know that the exponent we saw in the experiment

829
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,880
is 2.5 because

830
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,880
there are some very strong impurities in the導線.

831
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,880
So we can get our conclusion here.

832
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,880
So let's make a summary here.

833
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,880
First, what we said in the introduction

834
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,880
is that if you have a導線

835
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,880
and you have a very strong spin-over coupling,

836
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,880
you can use it to achieve some

837
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,880
topological states.

838
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,880
The second point is that

839
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,880
our research shows that

840
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,880
you can still use the IV curve to measure the導線.

841
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,880
From here, you can deduce

842
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,880
how strong the electromagnetic interaction force

843
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,880
in the導線 is.

844
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,880
Our analysis shows that

845
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,880
the IV curve in the experiment

846
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,880
of indium arsenide

847
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,880
allows us to deduce that Gc is about 0.2.

848
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,880
So this means that the spin-over coupling

849
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,880
in the導線 is very strong.

850
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,880
We know that indium arsenide

851
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,880
has a very strong spin-over coupling.

852
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,880
Now we know that it can achieve

853
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,880
a very strong electromagnetic interaction force.

854
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,880
So if you add these two factors together,

855
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,880
it tells us that indium arsenide

856
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,880
can be used to achieve Majorna bond state.

857
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,880
Then you don't need to use magnetic field

858
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,880
to achieve Majorna bond state.

859
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,880
This is my speech today.

860
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,880
I'll pause here now

861
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,880
to see if you have any questions.

862
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,880
Do you have any questions?

863
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,880
Let me ask you a question first.

864
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,880
When you talk about α,

865
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,880
is it the gate voltage

866
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,880
of the conductance

867
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,880
or the source voltage?

868
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,880
Is it the gate voltage

869
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,880
or the source voltage?

870
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,880
Is that right?

871
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,880
Yes, the V in the IV curve

872
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,880
is the source voltage.

873
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,880
Can you explain a little bit?

874
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Is there a more straightforward idea?

875
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,880
When α is equal to 0,

876
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,880
does it mean that this is a straight line?

877
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,880
What does α equal to 0 mean?

878
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,880
0 is the value of the current

879
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,880
in this IV curve.

880
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,880
Is it a straight line?

881
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.

882
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,880
Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.

883
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,880
Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.

884
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,880
I think this is understandable.

885
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,880
When there is no electron-electron interaction,

886
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,880
you are a little bit like...

887
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,880
If you are an ohmic contact,

888
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,880
If you are an ohmic contact,

889
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,880
you should get an ohmic line.

890
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,880
you should get an ohmic line.

891
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,880
When there is electron-electron interaction,

892
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,880
what does α mean?

893
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,880
When your source current is high,

894
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,880
When your source current is high,

895
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,880
you will get more current.

896
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,880
When your source current is high,

897
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,880
you will get more current.

898
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Let me see if there is a similar formula.

899
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,880
Let me see if there is a similar formula.

900
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,880
You can think like this.

901
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,880
Maybe I can use this.

902
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,880
Is there a simpler physical image?

903
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,880
We can think like this.

904
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,880
When you have an impurity at a point,

905
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,880
When you have an impurity at a point,

906
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,880
we say this is a strong impurity.

907
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,880
It means that your impurity is very strong,

908
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,880
so your conduction channel is interrupted.

909
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,880
so your conduction channel is interrupted.

910
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,880
So when you want to have current,

911
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,880
you have to pass this tunneling.

912
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,880
So you will have current.

913
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,880
This tunneling is equivalent to

914
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,880
density of states.

915
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,880
There will be density of states

916
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,880
in your conduction channel or lead.

917
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,880
When you have a strong interaction force,

918
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,880
when α is stronger,

919
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,880
it means that your density of states will be suppressed.

920
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,880
Because your density of states

921
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,880
can be thought of as the α-quantity of epsilon.

922
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,880
It is also a power law.

923
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,880
What is epsilon?

924
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Epsilon is energy.

925
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,880
So your density of states will be written as the rho of epsilon.

926
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,880
So it is equivalent to

927
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,880
how many density of states you have

928
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,880
near the Fermi energy.

929
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,880
If there is no interaction,

930
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,880
this α is 0,

931
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,880
which means that its density of states is constant.

932
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,880
Because it is constant.

933
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,880
So you will have some density of states

934
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,880
to allow you to tunnel.

935
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,880
When your interaction force is getting stronger and stronger,

936
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,880
α will get bigger and bigger,

937
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,880
which means that the density of states

938
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,880
near the Fermi level will be suppressed.

939
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,880
Because the α-quantity of epsilon,

940
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,880
which means that epsilon is getting closer to 0,

941
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,880
its density of states will be getting smaller and smaller.

942
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,880
Because of this,

943
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,880
if you want to tunnel into

944
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,880
the liquid state,

945
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,880
it will be more and more impossible.

946
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,880
You can think of it this way.

947
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,880
So you need a higher voltage

948
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,880
to generate a certain current.

949
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,880
Yes, you can say that.

950
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,880
Wait, what about the experiment?

951
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,880
Did I read it wrong?

952
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,880
Ok, I think I understand what you mean.

953
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,880
When your voltage is high,

954
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,880
your differential conductance

955
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,880
will increase.

956
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,880
Yes, it will increase.

957
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,880
Ok, I understand.

958
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,880
So,

959
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,880
I think I wrote differential conductance

960
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,880
at the end.

961
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,880
Here, here.

962
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,880
Ok, so this is the definition of α.

963
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,880
Yes.

964
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,880
So the higher your V,

965
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,880
the higher your differential conductance.

966
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,880
Of course, if you have a linear response region,

967
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,880
your voltage will be lower.

968
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,880
Your power load is determined by the temperature.

969
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,880
Yes.

970
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,880
Does anyone have any questions?

971
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,880
Ok.

972
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,880
If there are no further questions,

973
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,880
I will turn off the recording.

974
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,880
You can continue to discuss

975
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,880
in the conference room.

976
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,880
Let's turn on the microphone

977
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,880
and give a warm round of applause

978
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,880
to the speakers.

979
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,880
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

980
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,880
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

981
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,880
Are you ready?

982
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,880
Please turn on your microphone

983
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,880
so that the speakers can hear you.

984
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,880
Thank you.

985
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,880
Thank you for your speech.

986
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,880
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

987
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,880
I will turn off the recording.
