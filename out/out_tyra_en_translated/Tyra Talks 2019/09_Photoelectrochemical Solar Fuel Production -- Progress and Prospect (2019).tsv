0	10000	Hello everyone, and welcome to the Terra Talks on April 27th, 2019.
10000	13000	Our speaker today is Dr. Zhang Changming,
13000	20000	who is currently working as a postdoc at Technical University of Munich in Germany.
20000	28000	Today's theme is Photoelectrochemical Solar Field Production, Progress and Prospects.
28000	33000	Changming did his undergraduate degree in Technical University of Munich,
33000	37000	and then went to UC Berkeley to do his Ph.D. and postdoc.
37000	40000	He is now doing his second research in Germany.
40000	46000	We are very happy to welcome Changming to give us his latest speech. Thank you.
46000	50000	Thank you, Yu-Tung. Hello everyone.
50000	54000	Can I speak like this?
54000	55000	Yes.
55000	62000	Sorry if my speech is a bit laggy today.
62000	66000	It's 5 a.m. in Europe,
66000	69000	and I'm having my first cup of coffee,
69000	71000	so it might be a bit slow.
71000	75000	If you have any questions,
75000	78000	please feel free to interrupt me.
78000	84000	Looking back at the previous theme,
84000	86000	it seems a bit too broad,
86000	90000	but basically today I want to share with you
90000	98000	some of the results of the past two or three years.
98000	105000	From our perspective,
105000	109000	we need to use a lot of energy.
109000	112000	According to statistics,
112000	122000	the average energy consumption per year is 18 terawatts.
122000	127000	Of course, as technology advances, the number will continue to increase.
127000	130000	It is estimated that in about 30 years,
130000	132000	this number will increase to 60 terawatts.
132000	136000	This means that we need to find a source of new energy.
136000	142000	So far, most of this energy has come from so-called fossil fuels.
142000	145000	Of course, we have been burning fossil fuels,
145000	150000	which means that we keep putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.
150000	157000	We can also see that this is a project by UC San Diego.
157000	165000	They started tracking the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from Hawaii in the 1950s.
165000	167000	We can see that in 2015,
167000	171000	this concentration has officially broken through the 400ppm level.
171000	175000	Of course, this also causes the so-called global warming problem.
175000	179000	In order to solve this problem,
179000	183000	it means that we need to find a source of new energy at the same time,
183000	188000	and at the same time avoid creating more carbon dioxide.
188000	193000	This means that we need to find some energy that does not emit carbon dioxide.
193000	198000	A very ideal choice, of course, is solar energy.
198000	202000	For example, here we can see that on the surface of the earth every year,
202000	210000	the input energy of solar energy is 120,000 terawatts.
210000	215000	This is far more than what we need.
215000	218000	So in recent years,
218000	223000	we also know that solar energy devices are increasing all over the world.
223000	226000	But so far, it's about 300 to 400 gigawatts.
226000	232000	So there is still some time to go on the energy of the device.
232000	235000	But we can also predict that there is a problem.
235000	240000	The source of solar energy is not a very stable source.
240000	246000	It is related to the weather and the season.
246000	251000	So we need to have a way to store the excess solar energy.
251000	256000	In this regard, there are usually two directions.
256000	259000	One, of course, is the so-called development battery.
259000	264000	I won't talk about most of this today.
264000	266000	It's not my own field.
266000	268000	But in another part,
268000	273000	in addition to storing energy by battery,
273000	280000	my field is how to store the excess solar energy by chemical energy.
283000	286000	How do we do this?
286000	292000	Basically, our goal is to convert solar energy into fuel.
293000	299000	Our first method is the so-called electromagnetic method.
299000	300000	It's two parts.
300000	303000	No matter what method we use to generate electricity,
303000	306000	the excess electricity is generated by electricity.
306000	312000	Then we can make an electromagnetic cell.
312000	315000	Our battery is here.
315000	321000	We can put a blower in the positive and negative poles.
321000	323000	For example, in the positive pole,
323000	326000	where the oxidation reaction occurs,
326000	329000	we can oxidize water into oxygen.
329000	333000	In the negative pole, we convert water into hydrogen.
333000	337000	This hydrogen can be stored.
337000	340000	Then it can be used as fuel.
340000	341000	Whether it's solar power,
341000	348000	or the source of the electric car with the fuel cell.
349000	353000	This method is purely electromagnetic.
353000	355000	To do this,
355000	358000	for example, to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen.
358000	360000	In thermodynamics,
360000	364000	we need about 1.23 volts.
364000	367000	This is the most basic requirement.
367000	369000	But in fact,
369000	371000	no matter what chemical reaction we have,
371000	374000	there is a so-called kinetic barrier.
374000	377000	We have to overcome this barrier on both sides.
377000	381000	In fact, we need about 1.7 to 1.8 volts
381000	386000	to do the so-called water-soluble reaction.
387000	389000	This is one approach.
389000	397000	The other approach is to combine these two steps into one.
397000	402000	We directly convert light into fuel.
402000	403000	How do we do this?
403000	407000	For example, we can put an N-shaped semiconductor
407000	412000	in the positive pole.
412000	416000	When we put the N-shaped semiconductor into the water,
416000	420000	there will be a shocky barrier on the interface.
420000	424000	So its shock absorber and conductor will go up.
424000	427000	After absorbing light, we have electromagnetic current.
427000	430000	Because of the band bending,
430000	434000	the current will flow in the direction of the solution.
434000	436000	This current can be used to
436000	438000	do the oxidation reaction,
438000	441000	to oxidize water into oxygen.
441000	446000	This means that if we do it this way,
446000	450000	we need 1.7 to 1.8 volts.
450000	454000	The voltage depends on
454000	458000	the band gap of the semiconductor.
458000	461000	In terms of experience,
461000	466000	the light voltage can only do
466000	470000	up to 70% of the band gap.
470000	475000	This means that if we want to use the same semiconductor
475000	478000	to provide voltage for the solution of water,
478000	484000	we need a semiconductor with a voltage above 2.5 eV.
484000	489000	This means that most of the light in the solar system
489000	491000	is not easy to use.
491000	494000	We can also improve our approach.
494000	499000	We use different semiconductors in the positive and negative poles.
499000	503000	For example, in the positive pole,
503000	507000	we use a N-shaped semiconductor with a slightly larger band gap.
507000	509000	Then we can do the oxidation reaction.
509000	514000	After the short-wave long-wave light is absorbed,
514000	516000	the long-wave long-wave light can still pass through.
516000	518000	We use a smaller band gap.
518000	521000	At this time, we use a P-shaped semiconductor.
521000	526000	So its light electrons will run in the direction of the solution
526000	528000	to do the oxidation reaction.
528000	533000	This is the bottom layer of the semiconductor.
533000	540000	In this way, we can choose the most optimized band gap combination.
540000	544000	We can use most of the light in the solar system
544000	547000	to produce enough light voltage
547000	551000	to produce the so-called CO2 photoreduction,
551000	553000	which is more difficult
553000	558000	whether it is to produce hydrogen or the recently more popular,
558000	562000	which is to convert CO2 into chemical fuel.
564000	570000	So my research focuses on the so-called photoelectrochemical
570000	574000	solar energy conversion.
574000	576000	Today I will talk about
576000	580000	an example of a P-type photocastle.
580000	584000	I will also introduce some N-type photoanodes.
587000	592000	We want to find a suitable light-electrode material.
592000	596000	How do we define the efficiency of a photocastle?
596000	601000	How do we find a photocastle with high efficiency?
601000	604000	Basically, when we develop a photocastle,
604000	606000	we define its efficiency
606000	609000	based on how much light current we can get.
609000	613000	For example, this is our photocastle in the middle.
613000	620000	We can apply different potentials to the photocastle.
620000	624000	Then we measure how much current we have.
624000	629000	We can carry out this experiment
629000	633000	without photocastle or photocastle.
633000	636000	The gap in the middle is the so-called light current,
636000	639000	which is to convert light into current.
639000	641000	Because there is current, it means
641000	647000	that a circuit is formed between the entire furnace and the photocastle.
647000	650000	This means that there is a chemical reaction
650000	653000	between the furnace and the circuit.
653000	657000	Of course, the higher the light current, the higher the efficiency.
657000	662000	Basically, the intensity of the light entering the photocastle
662000	665000	is defined, because it is the radiance of the sun.
665000	670000	It is about the intensity of the global average.
670000	673000	So the light entering the photocastle is fixed.
673000	677000	If we analyze this way, the light current we get
677000	684000	is related to the three efficiency factors of our material.
684000	687000	The first efficiency factor is the efficiency of the photocastle.
687000	691000	Of course, the smaller the bandgap, the stronger the photocastle's ability.
691000	694000	There will be more electromagnetic waves
694000	697000	under the same photocastle.
697000	699000	After the electromagnetic waves are generated,
699000	705000	they need to move to the easy interface.
705000	709000	During this process, there may be so-called recombination.
709000	712000	The electromagnetic recombination disappears.
712000	715000	This means that it will reduce our efficiency.
715000	719000	So in order to have high charge separation efficiency,
719000	726000	we need our material to have a better carrier transport property.
726000	731000	Finally, when our electromagnetic or electromagnetic waves
731000	733000	reach the surface of the photocastle,
733000	737000	they need to do a charge transfer to the photocastle
737000	739000	to carry out our chemical reaction.
739000	742000	But these reactions are usually slower
742000	744000	and have a connected barrier.
744000	748000	So we will also have some efficiency losses.
748000	752000	Because these electromagnetic or electromagnetic waves
752000	754000	will stop at the surface
754000	758000	until there is enough time for the chemical reaction.
758000	762000	During this waiting time, there will also be so-called surface recombination.
764000	768000	In addition to these factors,
768000	772000	we also hope that our material does not require
772000	775000	a too expensive method of synthesis
775000	779000	or does not require some very rare elements.
779000	782000	It will be a little cheaper in terms of production cost.
782000	785000	Another point is that
785000	790000	these inorganic materials hate water very much.
790000	795000	It is very different from the water that humans or animals need.
795000	797000	These inorganic materials,
797000	802000	especially when you add a voltage to it in the water,
802000	809000	it is very likely to decompose or be unstable.
809000	812000	In order to do this,
812000	816000	we ultimately want to make this technology
816000	820000	into a large-scale mature technology
820000	823000	that can solve the energy problems of humans.
823000	826000	So we hope that the cost is low,
826000	829000	it is stable and efficient.
829000	833000	So we can take a look at our current
833000	837000	so-called solar cell
837000	840000	some more mature semiconductors in this field,
840000	841000	such as silicon.
841000	845000	It is efficient enough.
845000	849000	We also have very mature technology
849000	851000	that can do large-scale mass production,
851000	854000	but it is unstable in water.
854000	858000	The so-called tribozoic semiconductor is also very efficient,
858000	862000	but it is basically unable to do large-scale mass production at present.
862000	865000	They also have stability problems.
865000	868000	So my own research and
868000	874000	many people in the academic world are currently studying the so-called
874000	876000	metal oxide.
876000	878000	These are easier to manufacture
878000	881000	and at the same time quite stable in water.
881000	884000	But a big common problem is that
884000	887000	these metal oxides are undergoing
887000	889000	so-called energy conversion.
889000	892000	The efficiency of this application is
892000	895000	very, very different from silicon.
895000	900000	Our goal is to find out why
900000	903000	the efficiency of these metal oxides is still so low.
903000	906000	After understanding these reasons,
906000	910000	we hope to use these knowledge to guide us
910000	913000	to find a new material
913000	916000	that can meet these three needs at the same time.
916000	920000	So in the first part, I will
920000	924000	use this example,
924000	926000	the so-called copper iron oxide.
926000	929000	It is a P-type photocasol.
929000	931000	Then in the second part, I will
931000	934000	mention some so-called copper vanadium oxide
934000	937000	as a photogano.
937000	941000	The so-called photocasols
941000	944000	are a P-type material.
944000	948000	After it is absorbed, it is easily
948000	950000	re-reacted on the surface.
950000	954000	Basically, most oxidants are N-type
954000	958000	because it is easy to have so-called oxygen vacancy.
958000	962000	This is a native N-type defect.
962000	969000	So it is a bit difficult to find P-type oxidants.
969000	973000	The most common P-type oxidant is
973000	975000	sulfuric acid or copper oxide.
975000	979000	This material has actually been studied
979000	983000	in the field of solar cells quite thoroughly.
983000	987000	In terms of solar cells,
987000	992000	it can also have a pretty good efficiency.
992000	995000	But the problem is that
995000	998000	we want to do photoelectrochemical energy conversion.
998000	1002000	In the water, this material is very, very unstable.
1002000	1007000	It means that it will die in five minutes.
1007000	1009000	The reason for the death is that
1009000	1012000	we can see that its conduction band is mainly
1012000	1015000	copper 4s orbital.
1015000	1018000	After you light it up, the electrons in the conduction band
1018000	1022000	will convert a copper to a metal copper.
1022000	1025000	It means that in a very short time,
1025000	1030000	our oxidant will gradually be converted to metal.
1030000	1035000	So how do we improve this material?
1035000	1039000	One way is to add a second metal.
1039000	1042000	These are some common examples.
1042000	1044000	The advantage is that
1044000	1047000	because we still have a copper in our material,
1047000	1051000	these oxides are still native P-type.
1052000	1054000	Another advantage is that
1054000	1056000	after adding the second metal,
1056000	1059000	we can adjust our bandgap.
1059000	1062000	Either push the radiance band up
1062000	1064000	or lower the conduction band.
1064000	1066000	In this way, our bandgap is reduced.
1066000	1071000	We can use solar cells more efficiently.
1071000	1074000	Another advantage is that
1074000	1079000	after we change the character of the minimum conduction band,
1079000	1085000	we can reduce the chance of restoring the copper.
1085000	1088000	We can make the material more stable.
1088000	1093000	So the first topic I want to talk about is
1093000	1095000	copper iron oxide.
1095000	1098000	It looks like a very attractive material.
1098000	1101000	Because no matter copper or iron,
1101000	1104000	there are a lot of elements in the earth.
1104000	1108000	So the cost is very low in production.
1108000	1111000	The structure is here.
1111000	1116000	There are six oxides in every three iron atoms.
1116000	1119000	So it's a composite structure of the surface.
1119000	1123000	Copper is a linear composite structure.
1123000	1127000	It's basically a layer-by-layer structure.
1129000	1133000	Basically, if you look at the literature,
1133000	1135000	there are many different ways
1135000	1138000	to composite this material.
1138000	1141000	But there is a very interesting way.
1226000	1228000	Hello.
1228000	1231000	I can't hear Tom's voice right now.
1235000	1237000	Did you accidentally mute yourself?
1237000	1239000	I just got back.
1239000	1241000	Okay.
1241000	1243000	I just had some...
1243000	1246000	Can everyone see the screen now?
1246000	1249000	I can see it now.
1249000	1251000	Okay.
1251000	1253000	Can everyone see the screen now?
1253000	1255000	I can see it now.
1255000	1257000	Okay.
1257000	1261000	Did you cut off from here?
1261000	1263000	Yes.
1263000	1265000	Okay.
1265000	1268000	So basically,
1268000	1272000	if you go back to the literature,
1272000	1278000	there are several different ways to composite copper iron oxide.
1278000	1281000	The first way is called Sol-gel synthesis.
1281000	1284000	It's basically a spin-coating method.
1284000	1291000	You can see from the image of the electronic microscope
1291000	1296000	that it's a pretty tight film.
1296000	1304000	The blue data here is the so-called C-V curve.
1304000	1306000	That is to say,
1306000	1308000	under different voltages,
1308000	1310000	how much light current do we have?
1310000	1312000	It has this up and down jump
1312000	1315000	because sometimes there is light,
1315000	1317000	and sometimes there is no light.
1317000	1321000	So the gap in the middle is the so-called photocurrent.
1321000	1325000	The blue one is the so-called action-reduction reaction.
1325000	1327000	That is to say,
1327000	1329000	we put a lot of oxygen in copper iron.
1329000	1334000	Oxygen is also an easy-to-restore molecule.
1334000	1336000	So we can see that
1336000	1341000	this material can effectively restore oxygen.
1341000	1344000	But if we want to make it HER,
1344000	1346000	so-called hydrogen evolution,
1346000	1348000	which is to restore water to hydrogen,
1348000	1351000	we don't see how much current there is.
1351000	1355000	That means the surface of this material
1355000	1362000	is not very efficient for so-called hydrogen evolution.
1362000	1365000	We also found that
1365000	1367000	the main problem is
1367000	1370000	when you put this material in the water,
1370000	1373000	there will be a surface hydroxide layer.
1373000	1377000	The electron will be trapped in this layer
1377000	1382000	instead of being transferred to the water to produce hydrogen.
1382000	1384000	But the interesting thing is
1384000	1389000	you can also synthesize this material in the so-called electromagnetic way.
1389000	1391000	From the surface map of the electron microscope,
1391000	1396000	there are a lot of these small nanoparticles.
1396000	1399000	That means its surface area is getting bigger.
1399000	1401000	At the same time,
1401000	1404000	the materials made by electromagnetic method
1404000	1407000	are not entirely pure carbon iron oxide.
1407000	1410000	It is easy to have so-called copper oxide,
1410000	1412000	the second oxygen bucket in it.
1413000	1416000	This material is not only
1419000	1422000	compared with the previous SOLDIER,
1422000	1425000	but it can also be used
1425000	1430000	for CO2 photoreduction, which is theoretically more difficult.
1430000	1434000	Our CO2 is a very stable molecule.
1434000	1439000	Why are there so many differences in the activity
1439000	1442000	compared with the previous SOLDIER?
1442000	1445000	We can see here that
1445000	1448000	the morphology is basically very different.
1448000	1452000	And the purity of the material is also very different.
1452000	1455000	So the first goal is to
1455000	1458000	make a controllable synthesis method.
1458000	1462000	We can adjust the purity of the material
1462000	1466000	while maintaining the same morphology.
1466000	1469000	In this way, we can determine
1469000	1472000	whether the source of this activity
1472000	1475000	is the activity of the material itself
1475000	1478000	or the activity of the secondary phase.
1478000	1481000	The method we have is
1481000	1484000	Reactive Sputtering.
1484000	1488000	We have two targets, copper and iron.
1488000	1492000	We can have two negative targets.
1492000	1496000	We use argon plasma to hit the target
1496000	1499000	and deposit the material on the substrate.
1501000	1505000	In this way, we can make a large-scale,
1505000	1508000	easy-to-produce scale.
1508000	1513000	For example, we can easily make 5x5 cm2.
1513000	1516000	But in the industry,
1516000	1522000	it is easy to scale up to tens of centimeters.
1524000	1531000	We can also adjust the ratio of copper and iron in the material.
1531000	1534000	The middle is the ratio of copper and iron.
1534000	1540000	In 1 to 1, we get a very pure carbon dioxide phase.
1540000	1543000	We can see it from X-ray scattering
1543000	1547000	or from Laman-Campbell scattering.
1547000	1550000	It is a very pure material.
1550000	1553000	But when we add more iron,
1553000	1556000	we can see some secondary phase.
1556000	1560000	We can identify that it is mainly oxidized iron.
1560000	1564000	On the other hand, if we put more copper in,
1564000	1569000	the secondary phase we see is 2 plus oxidized copper.
1569000	1572000	After we have this series of materials,
1572000	1577000	we can make some more large-scale comparisons.
1577000	1580000	Whether it is the photoelectrochemical performance
1580000	1586000	or the material used to identify its optical properties,
1586000	1588000	its carrier transport properties,
1588000	1591000	or the electronic structure of the material.
1591000	1597000	First of all, in the so-called photoelectrochemical performance,
1597000	1601000	we do the same measurement first.
1601000	1605000	This is not the so-called hydrogen evolution.
1605000	1610000	We add this sodium persafate.
1610000	1612000	This is a so-called electron scavenger.
1612000	1614000	It means that it is also easy to be restored.
1614000	1618000	If you still remember this tetrahedron,
1618000	1624000	we add a very easy-to-be-restored thing in the solution.
1624000	1629000	It means that we assume that the last charge injection efficiency
1629000	1632000	is very efficient, which is basically 1.
1632000	1638000	We can see that we get about 1 mA per cm2.
1638000	1640000	So much current.
1640000	1643000	But if we don't add this thing,
1643000	1647000	it means that we want to do a hydrogen evolution.
1647000	1652000	Our current density is reduced by about 20 times.
1653000	1655000	This is the so-called pure material.
1655000	1661000	If we look at the material in this series we just had,
1661000	1665000	in the case of the electron scavenger on the left,
1665000	1668000	the density of the current is basically the same.
1668000	1671000	But on the right, we can see that
1671000	1676000	in the case where the copper ratio is higher,
1676000	1682000	the density of our current is obviously higher.
1682000	1689000	We can see that there is also another peak in the CV data.
1689000	1697000	This peak means that there is an additional oxidation reaction in the material.
1697000	1699000	If you still remember,
1699000	1706000	these more copper samples are actually non-pure oxidized carbon dioxide.
1706000	1711000	From this data, we can deduce that
1711000	1715000	especially in the lower right corner,
1715000	1719000	the higher current for CO2 reduction
1719000	1725000	is actually due to the oxidation of copper as a catalyst.
1725000	1727000	So no matter what,
1727000	1731000	our copper dioxide is just a catalyst.
1731000	1737000	On the surface, it can't restore CO2.
1737000	1741000	But when you have an excess of oxidized copper,
1741000	1748000	these oxidized copper will first be restored to oxidized arsenic or metal copper
1748000	1751000	to act as a catalyst.
1756000	1761000	Next, we're going to do a light quality measurement.
1761000	1765000	We're using the so-called spectroscopic isometry.
1765000	1768000	We can analyze its absorption rate.
1768000	1771000	We can also do a tau analysis.
1771000	1775000	We find that it's an indirect semiconductor.
1775000	1778000	The bandgap is about 1.43eV.
1778000	1782000	Its direct bandgap is about 3.09eV.
1783000	1789000	But as we said earlier,
1789000	1794000	our light current density is about 1mA per cm2.
1794000	1798000	But if we look at its bandgap at 1.4,
1798000	1802000	it can actually absorb a lot of light.
1802000	1806000	If we compare the light we absorb
1806000	1809000	with the ratio of current we get,
1810000	1813000	that's our conversion efficiency.
1813000	1815000	If we calculate this efficiency,
1815000	1818000	it's actually less than 10%.
1818000	1824000	That means after more than 90% of the light is absorbed,
1824000	1829000	we can't take it out of the semiconductor interface.
1829000	1833000	That means a lot of recombination occurs.
1834000	1837000	This recombination,
1837000	1840000	when we look at these new oxidizing materials,
1840000	1845000	it's a very common and the biggest limitation.
1845000	1851000	This is mainly a comparison.
1851000	1854000	The gray one is the so-called photosymbol diffraction.
1854000	1858000	That is to say, we measure the absorption of the material.
1858000	1860000	After the material absorbs light,
1860000	1862000	we convert the energy of light into heat.
1862000	1867000	We can see that it has a very fast sharp onset.
1867000	1873000	The red one is the so-called photo-to-current efficiency.
1873000	1876000	Its onset is also in the bandgap,
1876000	1880000	but its increase is significantly slower.
1880000	1882000	That means in visible light,
1882000	1885000	at 500 to 800 nm,
1885000	1887000	in this visible light area,
1887000	1890000	a lot of light can be absorbed,
1890000	1894000	but it can't be used as a photo-to-current.
1896000	1898000	At the same time, in the sub-bandgap,
1898000	1901000	we see a relatively small absorption peak.
1901000	1906000	We will come back to discuss what this is later.
1909000	1913000	We say that these oxidizing materials,
1913000	1917000	especially the common limitation of super-resistant oxidizing materials,
1917000	1921000	is the so-called bulk recombination.
1921000	1923000	Why is it like this?
1923000	1925000	If we look at these super-resistant metals,
1925000	1928000	we look at its band structure,
1928000	1931000	its 3D orbital is not fully filled.
1931000	1936000	If we use the general band theory to look at it,
1936000	1938000	it should actually be a metal material.
1938000	1941000	Why are these oxidizing materials a semiconductor,
1941000	1943000	even though it is a super-resistant material?
1943000	1948000	That's because these electrons have strong interactions with each other.
1948000	1951000	That means that because of these interactions,
1951000	1959000	our metal 3D band will split into the so-called sub-band and sub-band.
1959000	1963000	At the same time, we have oxides in the oxidizing material.
1963000	1968000	So depending on the oxygen 2P band
1968000	1971000	is in a place with lower energy
1971000	1972000	or a place with higher energy,
1972000	1976000	we can have these two types of insulators.
1976000	1978000	One is the Moharber insulator,
1978000	1982000	which means that the sub-band and sub-band are all metal 3D.
1982000	1987000	Or the sub-band is metal oxygen 2P
1987000	1990000	and the sub-band is metal 3D.
1990000	1993000	No matter which type,
1993000	1996000	in these oxidizing materials,
1996000	2000000	because they are, how to put it,
2000000	2004000	compared to the traditional silicon or 3-5 group semiconductors,
2004000	2006000	the characteristics of these oxidizing materials are that
2006000	2009000	although they are also semiconductors,
2009000	2012000	but our electrons have to pass through them.
2012000	2018000	Because these oxidizing materials are more ionic,
2018000	2020000	we have,
2020000	2024000	so the electrons have to jump around in different atoms.
2024000	2028000	For example, in this case in the upper right corner,
2028000	2034000	our electrons have to jump around in different metal atoms.
2034000	2037000	And the electrons have to jump around in different oxygen atoms.
2037000	2041000	This means that our electrons are very localized.
2041000	2043000	In the process of localization,
2043000	2051000	it will also change the structure of the metal around it.
2051000	2055000	It means that the structure will be a little different.
2055000	2057000	What does this affect?
2057000	2061000	It means that their mobility will be worse.
2061000	2064000	Just like in ordinary silicon,
2064000	2067000	it doesn't have this localized electron problem.
2067000	2071000	It's like going for a walk in the wild.
2071000	2073000	Basically, no one will stop you.
2073000	2075000	You can go wherever you want.
2075000	2077000	In these oxidizing materials,
2077000	2079000	for example, there are a lot of people in Simending.
2079000	2081000	If you want to go to a place,
2081000	2084000	it means that the people you want to go to
2084000	2088000	have to leave a space for you to go there.
2088000	2090000	It means that in the process of walking,
2090000	2093000	the environment around you will also change with you.
2093000	2098000	Of course, the mobility will be much lower.
2098000	2105000	We think that these oxidizing materials have poor charge mobility.
2105000	2107000	At the same time, for this reason,
2107000	2110000	we have a lot of bulk recombination.
2110000	2113000	How do we prove this hypothesis?
2113000	2119000	At the beginning, after oxidation,
2119000	2121000	the electromagnetic electron localized
2121000	2123000	to produce the so-called polaron.
2123000	2125000	This process is very fast.
2125000	2127000	So we want to use the so-called
2127000	2129000	phantocyclic contraction absorption
2129000	2132000	to observe this phenomenon.
2133000	2139000	Basically, a very typical measurement is like this.
2139000	2142000	First, we use a very short pump pulse
2142000	2144000	to produce an oxidized state.
2144000	2146000	Because the oxidized state
2146000	2149000	has a different electronic arrangement from the machine,
2149000	2154000	so its absorption of different light will also be different.
2154000	2156000	We can use the second probing
2156000	2158000	to measure the difference in absorption
2158000	2161000	of different oxidized states.
2161000	2165000	We can change the delay between the pump and probe,
2165000	2167000	so that we can follow
2167000	2172000	how it relaxes after producing the oxidized state.
2172000	2176000	But this method is basically
2176000	2178000	applied to the liquid state at the beginning.
2178000	2181000	We found that we are now
2181000	2184000	studying solid materials.
2184000	2186000	So in addition to the so-called transmission,
2186000	2189000	we also have to consider reflectivity.
2189000	2192000	This means that we have to measure
2192000	2194000	the so-called transmission, transmission,
2194000	2196000	and transmission reflectivity at the same time.
2196000	2200000	I skipped some details,
2200000	2203000	but the point is that
2203000	2207000	if we measure transmission and reflectivity at the same time,
2207000	2212000	we can return to the so-called differential absorption.
2212000	2214000	In the case of solid materials,
2214000	2217000	we can see this kind of
2217000	2221000	first-order or third-order
2221000	2224000	differential signal.
2224000	2228000	This is because different absorption oscillators
2228000	2231000	are either produced by shift
2231000	2235000	or oscillators by broadening.
2235000	2239000	This is how we used another material
2239000	2242000	to build this analysis.
2242000	2244000	Back to our carbon monoxide,
2244000	2247000	this is our transmission absorption data.
2247000	2251000	We can see that there are many changes
2251000	2255000	in the area near the interwebbing gap and the interwebbing gap.
2255000	2257000	At the same time, in the sub-webbing gap,
2257000	2259000	that is, in the infrared part,
2259000	2262000	there is a very flat absorption.
2262000	2265000	This is the so-called free carrier absorption,
2265000	2269000	which means that after being absorbed,
2269000	2273000	the free carrier absorption will appear in this area.
2273000	2277000	This free carrier absorption is actually very short-lived.
2277000	2279000	In about 1 picosecond,
2279000	2282000	this signal disappears.
2282000	2284000	At the same time,
2284000	2286000	for example,
2286000	2289000	near the interwebbing gap,
2289000	2294000	there is a relatively long-lived excited state.
2294000	2300000	We think this is indirect evidence that
2300000	2303000	our free carrier localizes
2303000	2307000	and produces a polaron state.
2307000	2311000	This means that after 1 picosecond,
2311000	2313000	we don't have a real free carrier,
2313000	2316000	but a polaron.
2316000	2320000	These polarons can still be charged transport,
2321000	2324000	but their mobility is relatively much lower.
2326000	2332000	Next, about the so-called electronic structure,
2332000	2335000	we first have a cooperation,
2335000	2339000	using the DFT plus U method to calculate,
2339000	2344000	to calculate the electronic structure according to the crystal structure.
2344000	2349000	The middle part of 0 is the Fermi level.
2349000	2353000	The low energy part on the left is the so-called valence band.
2353000	2356000	We see that from the calculation process,
2356000	2358000	at the top of the valence band,
2358000	2361000	the closest to the valence band edge is
2361000	2365000	mainly the copper 3D electron.
2365000	2368000	The lower part is the oxygen.
2368000	2372000	The lower part is the so-called iron 3D.
2372000	2374000	In the conduction band part,
2374000	2377000	there are two bands, iron 3D.
2377000	2380000	The higher part is copper.
2380000	2385000	We want to do an experiment to verify the calculation structure.
2385000	2388000	The first experiment is to use the so-called XPS.
2388000	2391000	It means that we use an X-ray
2391000	2395000	to isolate the valence band electron.
2395000	2398000	According to the analysis of these photoelectron's
2398000	2400000	kinetic energy,
2400000	2404000	we can return the binding energy in the material.
2404000	2408000	We can see that there are four peaks.
2408000	2411000	The two peaks at the top are
2411000	2415000	similar to the copper in the calculation result.
2415000	2418000	The next two peaks are
2418000	2421000	similar to the oxygen and iron.
2421000	2423000	You may ask,
2423000	2426000	why does the ratio in the experiment
2426000	2428000	look different from the calculation?
2428000	2431000	That's because in the experiment,
2431000	2435000	the ionization cross-section of the X-ray
2435000	2438000	is different for different elements.
2438000	2441000	In our experiment,
2441000	2444000	the ionization cross-section of the copper
2444000	2447000	is much higher than that of the oxygen or iron.
2447000	2451000	This explains why in our experiment,
2451000	2454000	the intensity of the two peaks at the top
2454000	2456000	is much higher than the other two peaks.
2456000	2460000	We can also use the so-called X-ray emission.
2460000	2463000	That means we also use the X-ray,
2463000	2467000	but now we isolate the electron.
2467000	2469000	Let's see how the electron of the valence band
2469000	2472000	returns the binding energy.
2472000	2474000	In the process of returning the binding energy,
2474000	2477000	we will emit an X-ray beam.
2477000	2482000	We can analyze the beam of the X-ray beam
2482000	2486000	to get the distribution of the valence band.
2486000	2489000	Here we see that in the oxygen,
2489000	2491000	the K-edge X-ray emission,
2491000	2493000	we also see four peaks.
2493000	2494000	In this process,
2494000	2497000	because we are looking at the co-level excitation of oxygen,
2497000	2499000	of course,
2499000	2502000	when the valence band is returned,
2502000	2504000	what we see is that
2504000	2508000	more electrons are returned from oxygen.
2508000	2511000	That's why we see that
2512000	2516000	the intensity of the peak in the middle is higher.
2518000	2520000	This is the valence band.
2520000	2522000	The conduction band,
2522000	2524000	in the calculation process,
2524000	2529000	we see that the two lowest conduction bands are iron,
2529000	2533000	mainly from the unoccupied iron orbital.
2533000	2538000	We use the X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
2538000	2539000	In this method,
2539000	2543000	we measure from the co-level
2543000	2546000	to the unoccupied conduction band level.
2546000	2550000	Then we can change the input X-ray energy
2550000	2553000	to see how much light can be absorbed.
2553000	2554000	We can compare.
2554000	2557000	For example, in oxidized iron,
2557000	2559000	we see two peaks.
2559000	2561000	This is because
2561000	2562000	for iron,
2562000	2564000	it is also a triangular iron.
2564000	2569000	There are six ions around it.
2569000	2572000	It is an octahedral structure.
2572000	2575000	So we can see that the 3D orbital of iron
2575000	2579000	is split into 1G and T2G levels.
2579000	2581000	In carbon monoxide,
2581000	2584000	we also see these two peaks
2584000	2586000	at the same energy.
2586000	2587000	At a higher level,
2587000	2589000	we find a new peak.
2589000	2592000	According to our calculations,
2592000	2594000	this may be produced
2594000	2599000	from the same unoccupied orbital.
2599000	2603000	We can also do this calculation.
2603000	2606000	This is also done with DFT,
2606000	2613000	using the many-body X-ray absorption calculation.
2613000	2618000	We can almost reproduce these three peaks.
2618000	2620000	We can also choose
2620000	2621000	from the calculation results.
2621000	2622000	These three different peaks
2622000	2625000	correspond to different final states.
2625000	2627000	We can see that the first peak
2627000	2631000	is the non-bonding state of oxygen and iron.
2631000	2633000	The second peak
2633000	2637000	is also the anti-bonding state between oxygen and iron.
2637000	2639000	The highest energy peak
2639000	2644000	is the anti-bonding state of copper and oxygen.
2644000	2646000	This means that we not only
2646000	2652000	verified that our calculations were correct,
2652000	2655000	but also that the two lower peaks
2655000	2658000	were contributed by iron,
2658000	2660000	while the highest peak was contributed by copper.
2660000	2662000	We can understand how different peaks
2662000	2666000	or different conduction bands
2666000	2668000	interact with each other.
2668000	2670000	How do we verify this?
2670000	2674000	We can combine the different X-ray spectrums
2675000	2677000	into the so-called
2677000	2680000	Resonance in Elastic X-ray Scattering.
2680000	2686000	Basically, we use different X-ray spectrums
2686000	2688000	to stimulate an electron
2688000	2690000	from the core level to the conduction band.
2690000	2695000	But we can also change the energy of the injected X-ray.
2695000	2697000	We can analyze
2697000	2700000	the X-ray emission
2700000	2702000	from the valence band.
2702000	2705000	What are the different changes?
2708000	2712000	This is also done in the advanced slide source of Berkeley.
2712000	2716000	Our sample is placed here.
2716000	2719000	We have a green X-ray.
2719000	2725000	We are analyzing the energy of the X-ray emission.
2727000	2729000	If you still remember,
2729000	2730000	two slides ago,
2730000	2733000	we said this is the K-H X-ray emission of oxygen.
2733000	2735000	The middle peak
2735000	2739000	is the contribution from oxygen to P
2739000	2742000	in the valence band.
2742000	2746000	The so-called RIGS data
2746000	2749000	is the same measurement,
2749000	2752000	but we change the different excitation energy.
2752000	2757000	The diagram looks a bit complicated,
2757000	2761000	but the X-axis is the same X-ray emission.
2761000	2766000	The Y-axis is the different excitation energy.
2766000	2771000	When we change the excitation energy,
2771000	2778000	the shape of the X-ray emission changes a lot.
2778000	2782000	In the first part, we can see the emission onset.
2782000	2784000	When we increase the excitation energy,
2784000	2786000	it moves to a higher energy level.
2786000	2791000	This means our material is an indirect semiconductor.
2791000	2792000	Why?
2792000	2794000	In our direct semiconductor,
2794000	2797000	the valence band maximum and condensation minimum
2797000	2799000	are in the same K-space.
2799000	2803000	When we increase the excitation energy,
2803000	2808000	the X-ray emission moves to a lower energy level.
2808000	2812000	But in the indirect semiconductor,
2812000	2815000	the valence band maximum and condensation minimum
2815000	2818000	are separated.
2818000	2822000	When we increase the excitation energy,
2822000	2827000	the X-ray emission moves to a higher energy level.
2827000	2831000	This is what we observe here.
2832000	2835000	At the same time,
2835000	2844000	we can see some other changes.
2844000	2850000	For example, when we emit at these two peaks,
2850000	2856000	we can see that the peak at the low energy level is more obvious.
2856000	2858000	But when we move to the third peak,
2858000	2860000	we can't see this peak.
2860000	2865000	Instead, we can see another sharp peak at the high energy level.
2865000	2871000	This means that when we emit at this peak,
2871000	2875000	we are emitting at an unoccupied copper state.
2875000	2878000	This means that our X-ray emission
2878000	2884000	will have more copper 3D characters in the valence band.
2885000	2889000	In other words, when we emit at two low-energy peaks,
2889000	2895000	we see our own emission and lower-energy iron 3D emission.
2895000	2898000	But when we emit at the third peak,
2898000	2901000	which is the so-called unoccupied copper state,
2901000	2904000	we will see more copper 3D emission.
2904000	2908000	This can explain the different changes we see.
2908000	2911000	This means that we not only know
2911000	2914000	that we are an indirect semiconductor.
2914000	2916000	The bandgap is 1.4 eV.
2916000	2920000	We also know that our valence band is copper.
2920000	2923000	Our conduction band minimum is iron.
2923000	2930000	This is a so-called metal-to-metal charge transfer semiconductor.
2930000	2938000	We can also do a similar measurement at the so-called iron L-edge.
2938000	2941000	In this method, we see that
2941000	2948000	X-ray emission and excitation energy are closely related.
2948000	2951000	In this method, we can see that
2951000	2957000	the first diagonal line is the so-called elastic scattering.
2957000	2961000	This means that it is the same energy as the X-ray emission.
2961000	2964000	So basically nothing happens.
2964000	2966000	But in the parallel direction,
2966000	2972000	we can see that there are two or three diagonal peaks.
2972000	2978000	This means that no matter what X-ray excitation energy we use,
2978000	2981000	we all have a fixed energy loss.
2981000	2986000	This is the same principle as our optical Raman scattering.
2986000	2990000	In Raman, this fixed energy loss tells us
2990000	2993000	what is the energy of the lattice vibration.
2993000	2999000	In this technique, this fixed energy loss tells us some different information.
2999000	3002000	How do we explain it?
3002000	3008000	We can also compare these different X-ray emissions.
3008000	3014000	This is not absolute X-ray emission energy,
3014000	3018000	but how much energy loss there is in the following.
3018000	3024000	In other words, we use a diagonal method to align these emissions.
3024000	3029000	We see that there are three fixed energy losses.
3029000	3032000	The first is about one electron volt.
3032000	3036000	That is, no matter what energy we use to excite,
3036000	3038000	we lose a fixed electron volt.
3038000	3040000	Why is this?
3040000	3046000	This is the configuration of our ground state.
3047000	3052000	It has five electrons and a high-spin configuration.
3052000	3055000	When we do an X-ray excitation,
3055000	3056000	we have a cold hole.
3056000	3059000	So we have an electric current at 2P.
3059000	3062000	We have an extra electron in 3D.
3062000	3066000	When it returns to the final state,
3066000	3068000	it can return to its original state.
3068000	3070000	That is, there is no energy loss.
3070000	3075000	Or it can return to a quadrilateral state.
3075000	3080000	This means that this energy loss is equivalent to
3080000	3084000	a spin from our ground state.
3084000	3088000	This electron volt energy loss
3088000	3093000	represents a TD excitation energy loss.
3093000	3095000	If you remember,
3095000	3099000	when we measured the absorption of light on both sides,
3099000	3102000	there was a small peak at the South Bank.
3102000	3107000	It was at about 1,200 nanometers.
3107000	3110000	If you convert it to the energy scale,
3110000	3112000	it is actually an electron volt.
3112000	3113000	This means that in practice,
3113000	3117000	we can actually observe this very weak absorption.
3119000	3121000	Then there are two other fans.
3121000	3124000	What is the reason for this?
3124000	3129000	This is also the so-called intermediate state.
3129000	3134000	At first, we put an electron in the iron conduction band.
3134000	3136000	Then we have an electric current.
3136000	3142000	This intermediate state is actually coupling with other intermediate states.
3142000	3145000	That means that when it returns to the final state,
3145000	3152000	what we see can be a charge transfer from oxygen to iron,
3152000	3155000	or a charge transfer from copper to iron.
3155000	3159000	When they return to the final state,
3159000	3164000	the energy difference from the initial state to the final state
3164000	3167000	will reflect the energy loss here.
3167000	3173000	The first one we see is about negative five to negative six electron volts.
3173000	3177000	Compared with our calculation results,
3177000	3183000	it is a charge transfer from oxygen to iron.
3183000	3191000	The energy loss in the middle is about two to four electron volts.
3191000	3194000	It is actually several peaks coupled together.
3194000	3197000	If we compare it with our optical absorption,
3197000	3199000	we can see that there are three peaks.
3199000	3204000	If we compare them,
3204000	3206000	they can basically be put together.
3206000	3209000	That means that the energy loss peak in the middle,
3209000	3213000	which is about three electron volts,
3213000	3220000	is mainly due to the charge transfer from copper to iron.
3220000	3226000	This energy loss can also be compared with our optical absorption.
3226000	3231000	In conclusion,
3231000	3238000	we used the Reactive Spotter to prepare this series of samples.
3238000	3246000	We can separate the so-called impurity phase and morphology.
3246000	3252000	We learned that
3252000	3258000	carbon dioxide itself does not have CO2 reduction activity.
3258000	3261000	This activity is mainly due to the fact that
3261000	3264000	when we have more copper,
3264000	3269000	the oxidized carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst.
3269000	3273000	We used a lot of different X-ray optical methods
3273000	3277000	to understand its electron structure.
3277000	3283000	We found that its valence band is mainly of copper 3D nature,
3283000	3285000	and the connection band is of iron 3D nature.
3286000	3288000	This means that
3288000	3291000	if we look at the structure of the metal,
3291000	3296000	we can see that it is a layer by layer structure of copper oxide or iron oxide.
3296000	3301000	This means that if we can control the direction of the growth of the metal
3301000	3306000	on the magnetic back,
3306000	3313000	maybe we can more efficiently separate the electrons and electrons
3313000	3316000	by using the Reactive Spotter.
3316000	3323000	If we can control the direction of the growth of the metal in a regular way.
3323000	3328000	Okay, I think it's about time.
3328000	3332000	Do you have any questions about this part?
3335000	3339000	Thank you, Chang-Ming, for the wonderful speech.
3340000	3342000	I'm going to stop the recording here,
3342000	3345000	and then we can start the Q&A.
