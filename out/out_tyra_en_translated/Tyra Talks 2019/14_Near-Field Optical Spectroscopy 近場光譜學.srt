00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, everyone. I'm the host of Taira, Hong Shih-an.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're honored to invite Hong Wei to give a speech.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hong Wei is now at North Carolina University.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He graduated from the Department of Chemistry at the National University of Transportation.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He entered North Carolina University in 2015.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He is mainly engaged in the study of light chemistry, energy materials, and nanoparticles.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He is interested in scientific writing and serves the science communication group in and out of the university.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The topic of his speech today is Near Field Optical Spectroscopy.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is a very popular topic recently.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's invite him to give a speech.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now you can turn on the microphone and give our speaker a round of applause.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's start.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you, everyone.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you, Jason and Project Taira for giving me this opportunity.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Today, I would like to share the Near Field Optical Spectroscopy.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Sometimes, we also call it NAMI optical nanospectroscopy.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Today, I would like to introduce to you why we do this technology and how it is done.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
NAMI optical nanospectroscopy is an application of NAMI 경찰institute for light.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For NAMI optical nanospectral?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We consider ourselves NAMI optical nanosceptical

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We are located at the University of North Carolina,

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
at the campus of the church.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Our lab focuses on the development of NAMI optical nanospectral.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is our program host, Dr. Joanna Atkin.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
NAMI optical nanospectral is a heterogeneity.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The concept is like a chocolate wall.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you look far away, you may only see a piece of green.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But if you look closely, you will find that it is a round chocolate wall.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And if you look closer, you may find that each shape is different.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Even the angle of each array is different.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This heterogeneity is often used in research materials.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We define it as a mesoscale structure.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is the structure of the mesoscale structure.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the structure of the mesoscale structure.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The distribution is about nanometer to micrometer length scales.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sometimes we deliberately introduce these heterogeneous structures for specific needs.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But sometimes it is inevitable.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When you generate molecules or materials, there will be heterogeneous structures.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is a sample of a semiconductor with a molecule.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is a sample of a semiconductor with a molecule.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This molecule generates two heterogeneous structures.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This molecule is a very chaotic structure.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This molecule is a very chaotic structure.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And the generation preference of the accelerator called hydrogen acetate is not available.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Most applications use hydrogen acetate for...

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
