1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Thank you everyone for coming to this talk.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are very happy to invite Dr. Lin Shujing from the University of Columbia, UBC, Canada.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Dr. Lin was trained at the University of Zhongshan Medical University,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in the Department of Radiation Science and Imaging.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
After graduating from this university,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
he obtained the qualification of a Radiologist of the Republic of China.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
However, he was very interested in academic research,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so he later completed a master's degree from the Institute of Brain Science at the University of Columbia.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
After the master's degree,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
he also served as a research assistant at the University of Yangming,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Rongzhong, Taipei City Hospital, and Jiaotong University.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In 2012, he went to the University of Columbia, UBC, Canada,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to start his doctorate in Neuroscience.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He graduated in 2018.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Today's talk is mainly about his doctoral thesis.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am very happy and grateful that he is here to share with us.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This talk is about the connection between the functions of the brain and neurodegenerative diseases,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
as well as the connection between cognitive functions.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's welcome him with a round of applause.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Can you turn up the volume?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If not, let me know in the chat.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can do it here.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can? Okay.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you for the introduction.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What I am going to talk about today is basically what I did in my PhD thesis.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The structure of today's talk will be based on the order of the chapters in my thesis.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The title is a bit long.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me explain.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The title of my thesis is called Advanced Neural Analysis of Resin-stained Functional Connectivity

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to Probe Exactive Functions in Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In simple terms, it is a way to look at the connection between the functions of the brain and cognitive functions

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
in neurodegenerative diseases.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's move on.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I wrote seven chapters in total.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The presentation will follow the order of the chapters.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In the first part, I will put the first and second chapters together.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The purpose of putting the first and second chapters together is to give you a brief introduction,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
including the symptoms of these two diseases and their clinical symptoms.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I will also put the second chapter together

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
because the second chapter is purely about behavioral studies.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So it will give you a more comprehensive introduction.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The third and sixth chapters are related to fMRI.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In short, we used different methods to analyze Resin-stained fMRI data.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We got different measurements.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
On the one hand, we want to see if these different measurements can be used as biomarkers

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
to clearly distinguish between patients and normal people.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
On the other hand, we want to see if these measurements are related to fMRI.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The seventh chapter is summary.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's move on to the first and second chapters.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In the first chapter, we will briefly introduce Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
These two neurodegenerative diseases are the main structure of the whole paper.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Parkinson's disease is more familiar to Taiwanese people.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It is a neurodegenerative disease,

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
which is common in men and older patients,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
for example, about 50 or 60 years old.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Another type of multiple sclerosis is called multiple sclerosis,

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
but it is more common in slightly younger women.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It is more common in Europe and the United States,

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
such as the United States, Canada, and North Europe.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It is also common in Taiwan, but relatively rare.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The picture on the right is a brief introduction.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The basic cause of multiple sclerosis is that the nerve on the left is a nerve tree,

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and there is a bulge on the outside called the myelin.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The structure of the myelin is attacked by a killer T cell,

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
so it is a kind of autoimmune disease.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This attack will cause the transmission of the nerve signal to slow down or cause some errors.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
On the clinical table, we can see that there is a problem with the coordination between the head and the eyes,

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and the patient's walking will be more unbalanced.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There are also a lot of visual problems,

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and the patient often says,

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
oh, I'm very tired. This is called fatigue.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There are also some cognitive function disorders.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Another Parkinson's disease is more common.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The main cause of the disease is that the neurotransmitter in the brain is not enough,

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and this neurotransmitter is called dopamine or dopamine.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In normal people's brains, you can see this picture.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This black part is a neurotransmitter that produces dopamine,

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and this part is called the subcentral nigra.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can see that it's very dark here,

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but in Parkinson's disease patients, these black things are gone,

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
which is the death of neurotransmitters that produce dopamine,

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
which leads to insufficient concentration of neurotransmitter.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
For example, we often hear tremor,

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and there is a problem with sleep, and there is a problem with walking balance.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In addition, there are also some cognitive function disorders.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So you can see that PD and MS are two very different diseases,

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
but they both produce cognitive impairment.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
According to clinical evidence and previous literature review,

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
MS produces the most cognitive functions,

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
including executive function,

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and Parkinson's disease visual memory.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
PD is also an executive function,

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and most people will have these problems,

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
as well as walking memory and visual spatial abilities.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In addition to the clinical evidence and literature review,

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we are also very interested in whether these cognitive function disorders

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
are related to the severity of their clinical disease or other factors.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So in the second part, we did a simple analysis.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We use Canonical Correlation Analysis,

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
abbreviated as CCA,

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
to see if their cognitive function performance

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
is related to other clinical data.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let me briefly introduce what CCA is.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It is a multivariate statistical approach.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The main purpose of CCA is to find two pieces of data.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's say we have two pieces of data, U and V.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The purpose of CCA is to find these so-called weights.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
These weights will let us know

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
what kind of linear combination will make U and V the most relevant.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
In other words, CCA finds this weight,

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and then we can infer

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
whether X1 is the most relevant,

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
or whether Y2 is the most relevant.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In the second part of the study,

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
one of the data is the demographic on clinical data,

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
such as the severity of the disease or age.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The other piece of data is the performance of cognitive function.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We did some tests,

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and then we took their scores to make a set of data.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's take a look at the results on PD.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
As we said, the purpose of CCA is to find linear combinations

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to make these two pieces of data the most relevant.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So here you can see that

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
these two pieces of data are indeed very relevant.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The relevant factor is 0.9.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
One of them is demographic on clinical data,

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and the other is cognitive function.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because we put gender in it,

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
all the variables are...

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait a minute, it's not out yet.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All the variables are positive,

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and the positive loading is related to the male.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
All the negative loading is related to the female.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And then, if all the variables are the same,

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
for example, positive loading,

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
they are both positive.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If negative loading occurs,

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
they are both positive.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This means that if this number goes up,

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the other numbers related to it will also go up.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So let's take a look now.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
In general, the result tells us that

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
in the case of PD patients,

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
if the male is also in a more serious state of depression,

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
it has nothing to do with cognitive function.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But let's take a look at the following.

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In other words, women with higher education

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
have a longer period of education,

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
which has a lot to do with most of the better cognitive functions.

150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
These are a series of tests we tested.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Actually, this is not what we tested.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a database called PPMI.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If you are interested, we can discuss it later.

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They tested a lot of different cognitive domains.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
In principle, the higher the number,

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the better the cognitive function and the better the response.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So you can see that women with higher education

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
have better cognitive performance.

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
As for MS, let's take a look.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This is the data we received.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The same thing.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The positive loading is related to the male.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If the negative loading is related to the female.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's take a look at the cognitive function part.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
These two are TMT, trial making test A and B.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Basically, it's a test of attention,

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and executive function.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What you can find is that in women,

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you can see that if it's a woman,

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
negative loading,

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
these two tests will perform better on women.

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
At the same time, we have another set of different cognitive functions.

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Here, you can see that if it's a male,

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
it will be related to EDS.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
EDS is an indicator on MS Clinical.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The higher the EDS value,

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the more serious the disease.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
On the other side,

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
it's the Wisconsin Consultant Error.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In other words, the higher the EDS value,

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the more serious the disease,

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the more mistakes it makes.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
On the other hand,

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
for women,

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
their performance will be better.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can see that these two tests are closely related.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So,

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
here is a conclusion.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We have categorized the same and different cognitive functions

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
of PD and MS.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
For the same function,

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
we find that gender is a very important factor,

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
whether it's PD or MS.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Especially for women,

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
their cognitive functions seem to be better.

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
On the other hand,

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
for PD,

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the higher the EDS value,

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the better the cognitive function.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We can use the so-called Cognitive Research Theory

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
to explain this.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In this theory,

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
the longer the EDS value,

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
the more protective it is.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, if a person has been educated for a long time,

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
he may get sick later in life.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The early education

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
may not be able to protect his cognitive function.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In addition,

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
we also found that

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
in the case of PD,

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
at first,

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
we were surprised to find that

214
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the clinical indicators of PD

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
are not related to cognitive functions.

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
One possibility is that

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the clinical indicators of PD,

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
which is similar to MS EDSS,

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
but we call it UPDRS,

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
are actually evaluated

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
based on the symptoms of the action.

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It is also possible that

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the neurotransmitters

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
related to action

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and cognitive functions are different.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
In addition, in the case of MS,

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
we can see that

228
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
the more serious the disease is,

229
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
it is related to the worse cognitive functions.

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
As we just mentioned,

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it made more mistakes.

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay,

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
this part is purely about

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the fact that

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
there is no FMI involved in behavior.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Next, we are going to talk about FMI.

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
As we all know,

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
if you have a little bit of research on MS,

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Functional MRI is a non-invasive method.

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We can use this non-invasive method

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to study the human brain

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
or the activity in the animal brain.

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And we usually take this material

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
for a period of time.

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Most of the data we use

246
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in this study is racing state,

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
which means that we require the victim

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
to lie in the machine,

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
close their eyes,

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and don't think about anything special.

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This is called racing state.

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This method is actually

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
more feasible in clinical trials,

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because many of the victims are patients,

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and they can't cooperate with you

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
to do some tasks.

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
For example, you may have to

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
respond to a case,

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
which is a little difficult for patients,

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
especially patients with Parkinson's disease.

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In addition, even if it is racing state,

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the victim did not do anything.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It still relies on the activity of the brain

264
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
to communicate a lot of cognitive functions.

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Then,

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I will explain the so-called

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
functional connectivity here.

268
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
In other words,

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
because this word often appears in the back,

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
for example, we get the racing state

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
fMRI data.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What we need to analyze now is to look at

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
its functional connectivity.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Suppose you are interested in

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
many different brains today.

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The so-called functional connectivity

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
is the signal of fMRI in these brains.

278
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Are they related to each other?

279
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll just use a picture to explain.

280
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It may be easier to understand.

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Suppose you have a brain today,

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and we are interested in three areas.

283
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We call it Region of Interest,

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
which is called RRI.

285
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
After some preliminary processing,

286
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
such as the difference in time,

287
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
or the difference in head movement,

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
we get these fMRI data.

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's a bit like

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
getting these fMRI data

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
is to get the fMRI signals

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
of these three brains.

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then use some statistical methods to calculate

294
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
whether the fMRI signals between

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Brain 1 and Brain 2 are related.

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If they are related,

297
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
we will think that these two brain areas

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
are connected to each other.

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In addition, there are many

300
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
different ways to calculate.

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The most common is

302
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Pairwise Correlation.

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There is also Partial Correlation

304
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or Mutual Information.

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There are many ways to calculate.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There is no limit to this.

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It depends on how you use it.

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The most common thing we see is a matrix,

309
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a color-coded matrix.

310
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If you are interested in this,

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
it means that

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
RRI1 and RRI2 are highly related.

313
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It means that

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
RRI1 and RRI2 are related.

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We know that they are connected.

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
In conclusion,

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
even if

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
we are in a resting state,

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
we can still use this kind of data

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to observe

321
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
its functional connectivity

322
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and then study

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
whether these functional connectivity

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
are related or not.

325
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Next,

326
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
since we want to study

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
cognitive functions,

328
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
especially Exciter Functions,

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
because both PDS and MS

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
are prone to

331
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Exciter Functions.

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So we did some

333
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
literature review.

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We found that

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
these are the brain areas

336
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
that are most related

337
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
to Exciter Functions

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You can see that

339
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
most of the connections

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
are Frontal Parietal Region.

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It means that

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Frontal Parietal Region

343
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and Exciter Functions

344
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
are related.

345
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
PDS is the same.

346
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Frontal Parietal Region

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and RCP are also related.

348
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
In addition,

349
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
there are connections in the opposite brain area.

350
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So we have a conclusion that

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
the so-called Long Range Connection

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
is very important

353
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
for Exciter Functions.

354
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The so-called Long Range Connection

355
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is a cortical-to-cortical connection.

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Just like what we said here,

357
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Frontal to Parietal.

358
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Next,

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
what we just observed

360
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is very similar to a model.

361
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This was proposed by

362
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Melvin Cohen in 2001.

363
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They believe that

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
there are three components in Exciter Function.

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The first one is Input.

366
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Input is the transfer of

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
sensory information to

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the internal state.

369
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The internal state is in the Prefrontal Cortex.

370
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
These signals are transferred to

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the Prefrontal Cortex for processing.

372
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
After processing,

373
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
the Prefrontal Cortex transfers the signals

374
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
to the Output Component.

375
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The Output Component

376
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
is in the subcortical area.

377
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The Prefrontal Cortex

378
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
is in the subcortical region.

379
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The Output Component

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and the Subcortical Region

381
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
must cooperate with the

382
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Motor Cortex

383
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to execute the

384
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
processed signals.

385
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It is very important

386
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
to study the cognitive functions

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
as well as

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
how different brain areas

389
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
work together

390
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and cooperate.

391
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This is the main goal

392
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and architecture of the paper.

393
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This is the main goal

394
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and architecture of the paper.

395
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's all for today's presentation.

396
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's all for today's presentation.

397
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We have already explained

398
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the first and second chapters.

399
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We will move on to the

400
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
FMI section.

401
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The third chapter is

402
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
focused on connection.

403
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
However,

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I found that

405
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the third chapter is too long,

406
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
so I will skip it for now.

407
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We can discuss it later.

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We can discuss it later.

409
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The fourth chapter is

410
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
static brain organization.

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The fourth chapter is

412
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
static brain organization.

413
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The fifth chapter is

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
dynamic functional connectivity.

415
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The fifth chapter is

416
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
dynamic functional connectivity.

417
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The fifth chapter is

418
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
sliding window approach.

419
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We will put together

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the fourth and fifth chapters

421
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to see if

422
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
these measurements

423
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,900
are related to

424
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
clinical indicators or cognitive functions.

425
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:09,900


426
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
clinical indicators or cognitive functions.

427
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
That's the conclusion of the seventh chapter.

428
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
That's all.

429
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Now we are moving to

430
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,900
the fourth chapter,

431
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
the FDIL section.

432
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Does anyone have any questions?

433
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Does anyone have any questions?

434
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Let's get started

435
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
with the fourth chapter.

436
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
The fourth chapter is

437
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
the Brain Organization section.

438
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
The so-called

439
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Brain Organization

440
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
is to study

441
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
how the brain

442
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
is organized.

443
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
There are several main principles.

444
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
First, we see

445
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Functional Integration,

446
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Functional Segregation, and

447
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
HUB Structure.

448
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
I will use a picture to explain.

449
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
As you can see,

450
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
there are many dots and lines.

451
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Each dot represents

452
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
a brain region in our brain,

453
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
the RRI.

454
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
Each line represents

455
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
the connection between

456
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
the two brain regions.

457
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
We think they have a connection.

458
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
The picture on the right

459
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
has many different colors.

460
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Each color represents

461
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
the individual community.

462
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
In other words,

463
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
this region

464
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
will form a network

465
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,900
between each other.

466
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
The so-called

467
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Functional Integration

468
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
represents

469
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
how well

470
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
the neural signal

471
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
is integrated

472
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
globally in the brain.

473
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
It is a community

474
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
that crosses different colors.

475
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
On the other hand,

476
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Functional Segregation

477
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
represents how well

478
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,900
the neural signal

479
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
is integrated

480
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
in the individual community.

481
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
So, Functional Integration

482
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,900
and Functional Segregation

483
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
are the opposite.

484
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
One is in the community,

485
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
the other is across the community.

486
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Finally, there is a concept

487
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
called HUB Structure.

488
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
Let's look at

489
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
the middle dot.

490
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
As you can see,

491
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
the HUB Structure

492
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
has more dots than

493
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
other dots in the community.

494
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
This means that

495
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
the RRI is very important

496
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
in this network.

497
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
It plays a central role.

498
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
So, we think

499
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
it is a HUB Structure.

500
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
At the same time,

501
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
it has many different connections

502
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
than other dots.

503
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
HUB Structure Integration

504
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
and Segregation

505
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
can be obtained

506
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
through Graph Analysis.

507
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
So far, I think

508
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Graph Theory

509
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
is a good way

510
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
to integrate

511
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
Functional Connectivity.

512
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
As we mentioned before,

513
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
after you get

514
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
the correlation matrix,

515
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
you will have too much information.

516
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
At the same time,

517
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
if you have hundreds of RRIs,

518
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
you don't know where to start.

519
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
So, Graph Theory

520
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
is a good way

521
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
to tell you

522
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
whether your network

523
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
is integrated or segregated.

524
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
In addition,

525
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
you can get many

526
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
different Graphical Measures

527
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
through Graph Theory.

528
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Each Measure

529
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
represents a network feature.

530
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
These Measures

531
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,900
can be connected

532
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
to cognitive functions.

533
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
So,

534
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,900
these are the research

535
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
done on normal people.

536
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
As for the disease,

537
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
we also did some

538
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
literature review.

539
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Overall,

540
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
we can see that

541
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Graphical Measures

542
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
are not different

543
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
from normal people.

544
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
It is possible that

545
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Graphical Measures

546
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,900
can be biomarkers.

547
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
In fact,

548
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
we have connected

549
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
Graphical Measures

550
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,900
to Cognitive Functions

551
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
to show the difference

552
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
between normal people

553
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
and patients,

554
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
so that

555
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,900
we can connect

556
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,900
the difference

557
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
to Cognitive Functions.

558
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Ok,

559
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
let's talk about

560
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,900
Material Methods.

561
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
We have two cohorts,

562
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
PT and MS.

563
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
PT and normal people.

564
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
As for MS,

565
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
when we were collecting data,

566
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
normal people

567
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
and patients

568
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
are not age-matched,

569
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
so I put all MS in

570
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
to see if their measurements

571
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
are related to Cognitive Functions.

572
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
We call it

573
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Brain Behavior Analysis.

574
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
In addition,

575
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
we took 18 MS

576
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
and 15 normal people

577
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
to do a t-test

578
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
to see if

579
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,900
our measurements can be biomarkers.

580
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
In addition,

581
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
in terms of data,

582
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
PT has

583
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Overall Cognition,

584
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
which is a Modular Cognitive Assessment.

585
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
In addition,

586
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
there are tests for different Cognitive Domains,

587
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
such as

588
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Visual Special Ability,

589
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Learning,

590
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
Working Memory,

591
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Excitement Function, etc.

592
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
In terms of MS,

593
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
we can divide it into

594
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
Working Memory,

595
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Processing Speed,

596
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
and Excitement Function.

597
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
At the same time,

598
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
we also did a questionnaire

599
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,900
to measure their

600
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Depression,

601
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Anxiety,

602
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
and Fatigue.

603
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,900
As I mentioned earlier,

604
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
the most important thing in GraphQL

605
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
is points and lines,

606
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
i.e., ROI and Connection.

607
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
We have 68 ROI here.

608
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
As for Connection,

609
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
after retrieving the FMR signal,

610
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
we do Partial Correlation,

611
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
which is

612
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Partial Correlation Matrix.

613
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Here,

614
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
we consider it as Functional Connection,

615
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
so we have points and lines,

616
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
and we can do the following analysis.

617
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
We use Brain Connectivity Toolbox

618
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
to do Graph Theory.

619
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
It is a free download of

620
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
ManLab Toolbox.

621
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
You can download it online.

622
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
As for the GraphQL Majors,

623
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
we can divide them into

624
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Global Majors and Nodal Majors.

625
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
In Global Majors,

626
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
there is a number

627
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
for each subject.

628
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
This number represents

629
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
the characteristics of the brain

630
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
globally.

631
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
For example,

632
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Global Efficiency,

633
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Pathline,

634
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,900
Rich Coop,

635
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Coefficient,

636
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,900
Modularity,

637
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
and so on.

638
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
I won't go into details

639
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
of each number.

640
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,900
In short,

641
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
they represent

642
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
Functional Segregation

643
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
and Functional Integration.

644
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Nodal Majors

645
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Here,

646
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
I mainly use

647
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Betweenness Centrality

648
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
and Local Efficiency.

649
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Betweenness Centrality

650
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
represents that

651
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,900
the higher the value,

652
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
the more important

653
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
the RRI is in the network.

654
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Local Efficiency

655
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
represents that

656
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
the higher the value,

657
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
the higher the Functional Connectivity

658
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
of the RRI.

659
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
If the value is different

660
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
in patients and in patients,

661
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
it may become a biomarker.

662
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,900
The so-called Brain Behavior Analysis

663
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
uses correlation and regression

664
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
to evaluate

665
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,900
if these measures

666
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,900
are related to cognition.

667
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Let's look at

668
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
the results of PT.

669
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
There are no differences

670
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
in Global Majors.

671
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
However, we find that

672
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Local Efficiency and Betweenness Centrality

673
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,900
have significant differences.

674
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Let's look at the picture.

675
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
This is the result of

676
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
Local Efficiency on PT.

677
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
You can see that

678
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
there are a lot of

679
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
dots on the right.

680
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
Each dot represents

681
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
an RRI.

682
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,900
We have a total of 68 RRIs.

683
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
These orange dots

684
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
represent that

685
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
these RRIs are actually

686
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
increasing in PT.

687
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
This is Local Efficiency.

688
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
In PT,

689
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
these RRIs

690
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
actually increase

691
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,900
their functional connectivity.

692
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
It's a bit different from what we usually think.

693
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Let's look at

694
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Betweenness Centrality.

695
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
These blue dots

696
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
represent

697
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
that their Betweenness Centrality

698
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
is decreasing.

699
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
In PT,

700
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,900
these numbers are relatively low.

701
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,900
RRIs like

702
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Superior Frontal Cortex

703
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
or Parietal Cortex

704
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
represent that

705
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
these dots are

706
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
the Hub Structure.

707
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
In theory,

708
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
these dots are very important.

709
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
However, in PT,

710
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
these RRIs

711
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
are not that important.

712
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Interestingly,

713
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,900
these two RRIs

714
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,900
on the right are

715
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Local Clearance Accumbance.

716
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
These two RRIs

717
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
are more important in PT.

718
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
Their Betweenness Centrality

719
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
is higher.

720
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
We think that

721
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
this might be related to

722
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
Compensation or Adaptation.

723
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
We will explain it later.

724
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
This is the result of t-test.

725
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
In the next part of

726
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Brain Behavior Analysis,

727
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
we will do Correlation and Linear Regression.

728
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
I can tell you that

729
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
you will not see any result.

730
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,900
As for Correlation,

731
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
there is an SDMT,

732
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Symbol Digital Modality Test.

733
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
It mainly tests process speed.

734
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
It is related to

735
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Global Efficiency and Pathline.

736
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Let's take a look at the graph.

737
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
Let's take a look at this one.

738
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Global Efficiency

739
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
The higher the number of Global Efficiency,

740
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
the better the neural signal

741
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,900
is integrated in the brain

742
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
in different communities.

743
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,900
Unexpectedly,

744
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
the higher the number of Global Efficiency,

745
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
the better the neural signal

746
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,900
is integrated in the brain.

747
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
It is related to

748
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
poor cognitive performance.

749
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
The graph on the right

750
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
is related to

751
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Global Efficiency.

752
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
The higher the number of

753
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Pathline,

754
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
the lower the number of Global Efficiency.

755
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
These two graphs

756
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
tell us the same thing.

757
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
The higher the number of

758
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
Global Efficiency,

759
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
the lower the neural signal
