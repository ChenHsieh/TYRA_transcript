00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone, welcome to the 7th of March, this week's Tara Talk.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are very honored to invite Dr. Jason Hong to tell us about his research.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The topic he is going to talk about today is Exploring Graphic Physics for Optical Sensing.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He said that this is his work when he was studying for his doctorate degree at UC Berkeley.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let me introduce Dr. Jason Hong.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He graduated from the Department of Physics in Taiwan.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He later studied for his doctorate degree at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
After his doctorate degree, he is now working as a doctor in Michigan.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
His field of expertise is super-fast light in physical and physical applications.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:58,000
His main field of expertise is optical sensing, two-dimensional semiconductor exciton and cavity exciton polariton.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He is going to talk about his work in his doctorate degree, Graphic Optical Sensing.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We are going to give him a round of applause.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But we need to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's welcome Dr. Jason Hong to give us a speech.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you, everyone.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I am going to focus on optical sensing in graphic physics.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I won't talk too much about super-fast light.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you want to know more about super-fast light, you can go to my previous talk at TerraTalk.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hello, everyone. I am Jason Hong.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is today's outline.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
First of all, I am going to talk about motivation.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I am going to tell you why we need to use graphene or, more broadly, two-dimensional materials to make optical sensors.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What are the advantages of using them?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What are the side effects of using them?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am going to give you two examples of what I am doing.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
One is to use graphene to observe electrochemistry.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Electrochemistry is the chemical reaction that occurs between a solid state and a liquid state.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We can use graphene as an optical sensor to observe these electrochemistry reactions.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is because we developed a method called Diffrational Vibrational Spectroscopy.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We can see the signals of the small molecules on the graphene.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Another example is that we want to observe neurotransmitters on graphene.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Neurotransmitters produce electrical signals.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
These electrical signals are the methods of transmitting information in our brain.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We put neurotransmitters on graphene and use graphene to observe these neurotransmitters.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is because we developed a method called Waveguide-Based Imaging.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We will introduce this method in detail later.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's start with Motivation.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Before talking about Motivation, let's learn about what is a two-dimensional material.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can you see the figure on the left?

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Can you see my mouse?

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes, I can see it.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is graphite.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The structure of graphite is a layer of carbon atoms.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When a layer of graphite is separated, it is called graphene.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When a layer of graphite is rolled up, it is called carbon nanotube.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When a layer of graphite is rolled up, it is called fullerene.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Historically, we first discovered the structure of carbon nanotube.

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We have never discovered the structure of graphene.

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Of course, we know that graphene exists in the structure of graphite.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But we have never seen the existence of graphene alone.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What is the reason?

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In order to calculate the properties of graphene, nanotube, and fullerene,

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the theorists already know the properties of graphene.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The properties of electricity and light are already known.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Before the discovery of graphene, there was a theory.

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
When the two materials of graphene exist separately, they are thermodynamically unstable.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The thermodynamic effect causes ripples on the surface of the two materials.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In the end, the two materials will stick together and become a bunch of wrinkles.

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Therefore, the previous theorists thought that the two materials alone could not exist.

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In 2004, the two Nobel Prize winners, Andrew Gamm and Novoselov,

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
discovered that they could use a very simple method.

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They put graphene on a tape and peeled it off layer by layer.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Finally, they put it on the silicon wafer.

64
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They observed that a single layer of graphene could exist.

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The main reason is that it is not an isolated 2D material.

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It also has some ripples.

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But because there is a substrate underneath,

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you can put the two materials on the substrate to make them exist in the world.

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
At that time, many people were trying similar things.

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There are many strange methods.

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In the end, they found that the most effective way was to use tape.

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In fact, there are many interesting stories.

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We can share them later.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
After the discovery of graphene,

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
we know that the two-dimensional material can exist alone on the substrate.

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Later, a series of two-dimensional materials were developed.

77
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Today, we focus on two-dimensional materials related to light.

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In fact, there are many different materials,

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
such as two-dimensional superconductors or two-dimensional magnetic materials.

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
For light, the most important thing is the bandgap of this material.

81
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can see that there is no bandgap between graphene and molybdenum and molybdenum disulfide.

82
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Graphene is a semi-metal,

83
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and there is basically no bandgap.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Molybdenum and molybdenum disulfide are two-dimensional superconductors,

85
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and there is a bandgap.

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Graphene is an insulator,

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and there is a very large bandgap.

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We have all kinds of two-dimensional materials,

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
which can cover the entire spectrum of light.

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
In fact, in each spectrum,

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
in each region from microwave to visible,

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
people use two-dimensional materials to do something.

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The interesting thing is that two-dimensional materials give you a lot of new degrees of freedom.

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
For example, you can change the number of layers,

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you can change the doping of electrons in the two-dimensional material,

96
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and usually the two-dimensional material is a hexagonal structure,

97
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so it has two different values.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There are two minima on the bandstructure.

99
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And these two-dimensional materials are very easy to integrate.

100
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What we can do now is that

101
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
we can use some methods to pick up these two-dimensional materials,

102
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and then we can stack them layer by layer to the place we want.

103
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The important thing is that

104
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
you have to match the lattice.

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
For example, in the past, the structure was used to grow.

106
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The way to grow is to make sure that

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the lattice of the base and the thing you want to grow is the same.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Otherwise, you will have a lot of strain.

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It will lead to a lot of constraints for these devices.

110
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But the two-dimensional material does not have this problem.

111
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can put it wherever you want.

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So we can do a lot of things that we couldn't do before.

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
These two-dimensional materials have a very strong effect on light.

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We will see these effects later.

115
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When you have this two-dimensional material toolbox,

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and there are so many new degrees of freedom,

117
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
we can do a lot of different things.

118
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
For example, someone is studying how to use two-dimensional materials to make photodetectors and modulators.

119
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There are LEDs and lasers for light.

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There are also people doing nonlinear optics or single photon emission.

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
In short, I think this field is quite developed.

122
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And there are a lot of new ideas that need to be tried.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And none of them have been tried.

124
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So we don't know what will happen.

125
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why do I choose graphene as a light sensor?

126
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What are the advantages of graphene sensors?

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
From the perspective of two-dimensional materials,

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the first is that it has very good sensitivity.

129
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The second advantage is that because it is a two-dimensional material,

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
we can easily change its electron doping.

131
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
From the perspective of optics,

132
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
when you want to make a sensor,

133
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
you need to pay attention to the light.

134
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you use light to detect or compare to other methods,

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
such as electromagnetic or other hardware,

136
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the advantage of light is that it is non-invasive.

137
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And you can penetrate the lower part.

138
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So when the light hits your sample,

139
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you will not cause damage to the sample.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And the more interesting thing is that light can do spectroscopy.

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So you can get a lot of extra information.

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it can do imaging.

143
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Sometimes it's what you really want.

144
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
For example, we want to do the structure of neural cells.

145
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How do we imagine it?

146
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is a very important thing.

147
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Sorry, can I interrupt you?

148
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No problem.

149
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
OK, I want to ask.

150
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because we are also doing 2D material.

151
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You said that it is easy to do doping on 2D.

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But I want to know your strategy.

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Because we encountered a big problem.

154
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
In fact, we found that it was not so simple.

155
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Or doping is actually unstable.

156
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The doping I'm talking about here is mainly electrical doping.

157
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We add an electrode.

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Then inject the electron directly with the method of electrolysis.

159
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's actually gate control.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes, it's gate control.

161
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
OK, so I misunderstood.

162
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
OK, thank you.

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I think you want to talk about chemical doping.

164
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Similar.

165
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It should be called twin Fermi level.

166
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Later, when I talk about examples.

167
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You will see how we tune the Fermi level.

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think this degree of freedom is very important.

169
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And it's a new degree of freedom.

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I think it's quite useful.

171
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Graphene is the first two-dimensional material to be discovered.

172
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It is a one-layer atomic layer.

173
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Everyone says it has very good electrical, optical, chemical and mechanical properties.

174
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Electrical has very high mobility.

175
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Optical has a very strong light response.

176
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Interestingly, a single layer of graphene can absorb 2% of light.

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This is actually quite interesting.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can imagine that a single layer of atomic layer can absorb 2% of light.

179
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Another interesting thing is that you can directly see graphene with the naked eye.

180
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This is also something that people may not have thought of before 2004.

181
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Chemical properties.

182
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Graphene is actually a structure of many hexagonal carbons.

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So it has a very strong pi-pi reaction.

184
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Many people use this pi-pi reaction to functionalize graphene.

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then you can do different things.

186
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Mechanically, graphene has a very strong elasticity.

187
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So it is very flexible.

188
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I think the most important thing is that graphene is a single atomic layer.

189
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So all the material is on its surface.

190
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This material is very sensitive to its environment.

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If there is a little movement outside, graphene will react.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I think this is the most important thing for the optical sensor.

193
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I have a question.

194
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is there a selection rule for the interaction between graphene and light?

195
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What is the interaction between graphene and light?

196
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Is its mechanism a dipole?

197
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes, it is a dipole.

198
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Graphene is a Dirac cone structure.

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can imagine that it is a band-to-band interaction.

200
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
From the bottom valence band to the top conduction band.

201
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Because the bottom is filled with electrons and the top is empty.

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So this transition is allowed.

203
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That transition is the 2% assumption I mentioned.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
There are also intra-band transitions.

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
There is also acetone in higher energy.

206
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is the band structure of graphene.

207
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Brinois zone is hexagonal.

208
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There are Dirac cones at the edge of the Brinois zone.

209
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Its energy and momentum dispersion are linear.

210
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
General semiconductors are parabolic.

211
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If you calculate like this, the density of state is also linear.

212
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can see that the density of state is equal to the Fermi energy.

213
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When the Fermi energy is zero, the density of state is very small.

214
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What does it mean?

215
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When there is some external influence,

216
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
which causes some doping in the graphene,

217
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the Fermi energy will move very fast.

218
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If it moves fast, it means that it is easy to change the optical transition.

219
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This causes that the external influence of graphene is very large.

220
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
One of the effects is that the electrical energy is also very large.

221
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What I show here is a field effect device.

222
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Basically, graphene is on silicon dioxide.

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Silicon dioxide is an insulator.

224
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Silicon is a conductor.

225
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Graphene and silicon form an electrolyte.

226
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
When you add a voltage, the graphene will be electrically doped.

227
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The electrons will go to the graphene.

228
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Or you can extract the electrons in the graphene.

229
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The graph on the right shows that when you change the gate voltage,

230
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that is, when you change the number of electrons in the graphene,

231
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
its resistance will increase and decrease.

232
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This is a very important phenomenon of graphene.

233
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The external voltage can change the resistance of graphene.

234
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The change is very drastic.

235
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Many people use this principle to make graphene's electrical sensor.

236
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Another advantage of graphene is that it is flexible.

237
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This means that it can be compatible with biological materials.

238
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It can make all kinds of flexible devices.

239
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It can also do chemical binding.

240
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
For example, you can add DNA or protein to it.

241
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
In this way, you will have some chemical selectivity.

242
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Next, I will talk about two examples I made.

243
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's start with the first example.

244
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The first example is to use graphene to look at the chemistry near the electrode.

245
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Do you have any other questions before I talk about it?

246
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay, no.

247
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Then I will continue.

248
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
There is a very important problem.

249
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
In fact, we often use graphene as an electrode in our daily life.

250
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
For example, your home's carbonate battery is also used as an electrode.

251
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You know that the battery has to produce chemical reactions.

252
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
These chemical reactions are actually produced on these deliberate cross-sections.

253
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:32,000
How to understand these chemical processes is a very important thing.

254
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We developed a method.

255
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We use IR light to detect the molecules near the graphene.

256
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is the main mechanism of IR infrared vibrational spectroscopy.

257
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
These molecules have different vibration modes.

258
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:17,000
These vibration modes have different frequency.

259
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
When you put a IR light on these molecules,

260
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
it will excite these vibrations.

261
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Then the IR light will be absorbed.

262
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Because the IR light will only be absorbed at that frequency,

263
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
you can see what kind of vibration structure these molecules have.

264
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Of course, different molecules also have different vibration structures.

265
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So you can tell which molecule you are hitting now.

266
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
In fact, you can know the arrangement and appearance of these molecules in more detail.

267
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:11,000
For example, you can see that EXO's spectrum is light energy.

268
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This is about three microns of light.

269
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
These peaks represent several different vibration modes.

270
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
There is a problem.

271
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Because the chemical reactions on the surface are very rare.

272
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Very few molecules are involved in the reaction.

273
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because usually only one or two layers are enough.

274
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
How to see this one or two-layer molecule structure is a big problem.

275
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
In general, the absorption of one-layer molecules is about 10 to the power of 3 to 10 to the power of 4.

276
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You have to spend a lot of time to integrate the signal to see it.

277
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We developed a method called diffractional spectroscopy.

278
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
In general, people do IR spectroscopy.

279
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
When you hit the light of the IR, you can see its reflection.

280
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
At this time, the electric field can be imagined as the electric field from the substrate.

281
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
The electric field from the substrate and the electric field from the molecule are quite close.

282
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The difference in intensity is the electric field square.

283
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:03,000
When you expand this, you will find that it is two times one from the molecule divided by one from the substrate.

284
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This is about 0.2%, which is about 10 to the power of 4.

285
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The method we use is to make graphene into a periodic grating shape.

286
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Only on the surface of the graphene will there be these molecules.

287
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You can imagine that these things are grating, so they will produce one-layer reflection or two-layer reflection.

288
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Of course, we only look at one-layer reflection.

289
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because the interface between the substrate and the solution is actually non-periodic,

290
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
it does not participate in the diffraction.

291
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Only graphene and these molecules can participate in the diffraction.

292
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
At this time, the electric field from the substrate and the electric field from the molecule are close.

293
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:30,000
As mentioned earlier, the absorption of graphene is about 2%, which means that its electric field is about 1%.

294
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The electric field from the substrate is about 10 to the power of 3.

295
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
When you do the calculation like this, you will find that it is the electric field from the molecule and the electric field from the graphene.

296
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This thing is obviously much bigger, and now it becomes 20%.

297
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
In theory, it can suddenly increase the sensitivity by 100 times.

298
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
This thing is likely to allow you to detect single-layer molecules.

299
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Can I ask a question?

300
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Does the original reflection affect the mechanism just now?

301
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Will it affect the signal that you finally gradient?

302
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The original reflection will be at the angle of the reflection.

303
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But at this time, we can choose to only look at the angle of the diffraction.

304
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, I see.

305
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Then we look at this angle and there will be a very strong signal.

306
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Thank you.

307
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Then we make the graphene into the shape of the grating.

308
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:01,000
On the other side of the graphene, there is a platinum electrode with a voltage.

309
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
This is basically a battery structure.

310
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,000
When the light hits it, of course you will have a reflected signal.

311
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But there will also be a diffraction signal from the periodic structure of the graphene.

312
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We can basically use the method of light to select that we only need to look at the diffraction.

313
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Basically, what we see is the intensity of the diffraction.

314
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You don't have to look at the red line first, just look at the black line.

315
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The dots are experimental.

316
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You can see that the charge control point is basically the graphene at Fermi energy equals zero.

317
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
There will be some diffraction.

318
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:12,000
When you increase the electron in the graphene, the intensity of the diffraction will decrease.

319
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
When you add more, it will increase again.

320
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The first thing we need to understand is how the diffraction occurs in the graphene.

321
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We can understand that there are two kinds of transitions in the graphene.

322
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
One is the interband transition.

323
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,000
The graphene balance band is full of electrons.

324
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The graphene conduction band has no electrons.

325
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
When the light comes in, it can go from an electron state to a state without electrons.

326
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This is the transition allowed.

327
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The light will be 2% absorption.

328
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
When you change your Fermi energy,

329
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,000
For example, the low-energy light has some electrons in its conduction band.

330
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
These electrons can't go up.

331
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
This transition is called forbidden.

332
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It can't produce this transition.

333
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
These lights will be transmitted.

334
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Basically, we can see that when the light is 2EF,

335
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
there will be an onset.

336
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It can be absorbed above 2EF.

337
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It can't be absorbed below 2EF.

338
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
When you change the Fermi energy,

339
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
the onset will be changed.

340
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Another kind of absorption is called free carrier response.

341
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It is called the interband transition.

342
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The graphene electrons jump from the balance band to the balance band.

343
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This is not possible in light theory.

344
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Light has a very small momentum.

345
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:52,000
This is the scattering caused by the phonon or defect in the graphene.

346
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
When the free carrier increases,

347
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
when the doping increases,

348
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
it also increases.

349
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Doping is a Drude behavior.

350
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It is a Lorentzian type of behavior.

351
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
When you add these two things together,

352
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
you will find that we can calculate the optical conductivity of graphene.

353
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The optical conductivity is basically equal to the diffraction intensity.

354
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You can see the graph on the right.

355
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
For example, let's look at 0.13EV.

356
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
When the Fermi energy is 130mEV,

357
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
on the right is the interband transition.

358
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
There are some absorption here.

359
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
There is an onset here.

360
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This is 2EF.

361
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The area of 3000 is 2EF.

362
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The upper part is the interband transition.

363
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The lower part is blocked.

364
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The bulging part is the interband transition.

365
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
When the EF increases,

366
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
the interband transition increases.

367
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The onset of the interband transition is shifted to the right.

368
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Our experiment is done at about 3000EV,

369
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
which is about 3.3uEV.

370
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You can see that when the Fermi energy is very small,

371
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
it is mainly an interband transition.

372
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
This causes a large diffraction intensity at the CMP.

373
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
However, when the doping occurs,

374
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
the interband transition is gradually blocked.

375
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The intensity starts to drop,

376
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
which is about 0.8 to 0.4.

377
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Finally, when you continue to increase the doping,

378
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
the interband transition will start to participate in the absorption.

379
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You will see a strong diffraction intensity.

380
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We can understand the diffraction of graphene in this way.

381
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Next, we will do a demonstration.

382
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We put a molecule called Ctab.

383
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It is a long-chain structure.

384
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
These long-chain structures like to run on the electrode of graphene.

385
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
We use IR spectroscopy to look at these Ctab molecules.

386
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
They are on the channel of diffraction.

387
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We see that the spectrum is similar to this.

388
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Basically, the diffraction is the interference of the electric field of graphene

389
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and the electric field of the molecule.

390
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
The diffraction intensity you see is also like this.

391
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It has a background.

392
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
This background is from graphene, which is about 0.85.

393
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
In addition, these peaks are from these molecules.

394
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
There are many CH2 and CH3 in this long-chain molecule.

395
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We can compare these with the database.

396
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We can know which vibration mode each peak represents.

397
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
For example, this peak may be symmetric CH2.

398
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This peak may be anti-symmetric CH2.

399
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This peak may be CH3 vibration.

400
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This spectrum is taken in 0.1 seconds.

401
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:29,000
We can compare the contrast with the detection you do directly with reflection.

402
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The contrast has increased by 50 times, which is about 100 times as we expected.

403
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The density of this molecule is actually only 0.16 monolayer.

404
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It is actually a very small density in graphene.

405
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We can already see it.

406
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
This means that this method can enhance our sensitivity.

407
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We can see 0.16 monolayer changes in 0.1 seconds.

408
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Excuse me, can I ask?

409
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Is the size of this molecule and the size of this graphene similar to what you show on the picture?

410
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Or is it not different at all?

411
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
The size of the molecule?

412
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
What do you mean?

413
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Do you mean the picture on the left?

414
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes.

415
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
This picture is a memory map.

416
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So the CTAP is much smaller than the graphene.

417
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm just a little curious.

418
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So what is the width of the graphene?

419
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Because I didn't see it when you showed the picture.

420
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I forgot.

421
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It should be around 1 to 2 microns.

422
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Because you can imagine that our light goes in three microns.

423
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So if you want to separate the first order and the first order, it's probably in that order.

424
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I see. Thank you.

425
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Next, we will demonstrate that we can directly observe the chemical reaction on the graphene.

426
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And it's timely.

427
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Because we can see 0.16 monolayers in 0.1 seconds.

428
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So you can actually see these reactions very quickly.

429
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Basically, CTAP and graphene will produce a reaction when your gating is large enough.

430
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
They will produce a reaction like this.

431
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
CTAP will throw an electron and produce these reactions.

432
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You can see the picture we just showed before the reaction.

433
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
After the reaction, the spectrum has changed.

434
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And the first thing is that the background has changed.

435
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The background means that the graphene was originally 0.85.

436
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The intensity is about 0.85.

437
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Now it's more than 2.

438
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This means that the graphene has been doped.

439
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And the Fermi energy of the graphene has changed.

440
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So the intensity of the background has changed.

441
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Another thing you can see is that you can see the anti-symmetric CH2 and CH3.

442
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
The anti-symmetric CH2 is still there.

443
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But the CH3 peak is significantly redshifted.

444
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
This means that when these molecules are on the graphene,

445
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Because the packing is tight, the vibration of CH3 is redshifted.

446
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
This means that the chemical reaction has occurred.

447
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So we can see these small spectrum changes.

448
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
This is a demonstration.

449
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
We can observe these chemical reactions near the graphene in an in-situ way.

450
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
We can use the diffraction method.

451
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:39,000
In this experiment, we developed the diffraction spectroscopy method.

452
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This method can improve the detection sensitivity and surface specificity.

453
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We think that this method can be applied to electrolyte and electrode.

454
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Because it is very easy to make the shape of the graphene into a grating.

455
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So I think this is a very general method.

456
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I think it can be used as a reference for those who do chemical engineering.

457
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Next, I will talk about how to use graphene for biosensing.

458
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The main thing we need to measure is bioelectricity.

459
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It is the electrical signal of nerve cells or heart cells.

460
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The electrical signal of nerve cells is a very hot topic.

461
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Although it has been a long time, people do not know much about it.

462
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
We know how a single nerve cell transmits electrical signals.

463
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:03,000
But we do not know what the electrical signals mean on a network of nerve cells.

464
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
What does it mean that I am happy or sad?

465
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
How is the information stored and processed in the human brain?

466
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This is actually a very interesting question.

467
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But we do not have good tools to study this issue.

468
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Currently, there are two ways to detect the action potential on the market.

469
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The action potential is actually the electrical signal of these nerves.

470
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
One method is the multi-electrode array.

471
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
There are many small electrodes.

472
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
When the nerve cells are placed on the electrode,

473
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the electrodes detect the electrical signals.

474
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The other method is the voltage-sensitive array.

475
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.

476
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.

477
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.

478
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But two things are important.

479
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The first thing is that we do not want the nerve cells to have labels.

480
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It is very troublesome to label the nerve cells one by one.

481
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The advantage of the multi-electrode array is that it does not need to label.

482
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
But the trouble is that it is not parallel.

483
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Parallel means that you have to connect a line to each electrode.

484
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Then use an amplifier to enhance the electrical signal.

485
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So you have to use an amplifier for each electrode.

486
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This is very difficult and expensive.

487
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The advantage of the multi-sensitive array is that it is very parallel.

488
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Because you use light to detect the signal.

489
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So you just take a camera and keep taking pictures.

490
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This thing is very easy.

491
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
But the other thing is that you have to display each cell.

492
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So you need to label the cell.

493
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
When you label, you will have a lot of problems.

494
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Some voltage-sensitive arrays are toxic.

495
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It will cause the nerve cells not to respond.

496
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Some are said to cause abnormalities in the nerve cells.

497
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Even though it is emitting a signal,

498
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
If it is an abnormal cell,

499
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
There is no point in studying it.

500
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Labeling causes the reaction of the nerve cells to be different.

501
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So we want to find a method that is both label-free and parallel.

502
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The detection scheme we want is

503
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Sensitivity is about 200 microvolts.

504
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Spatial resolution is about 10 microns.

505
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
10 microns is the size of a nerve cell.

506
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
We want to have real-time detection.

507
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The duration is about 1 millisecond.

508
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
We are a optical detector.

509
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So we want to have total internal reflection.

510
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Because we want to remove the scattering of nerve cells.

511
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Then we start to consider.

512
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
The first thing to consider is whether your signal-to-noise is enough.

513
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Can graphene detect electrical signals from nerve cells?

514
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
If we use the general method of transmission.

515
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
When you shine a light,

516
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You can imagine that the electrode is a nerve cell.

517
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
When you add an electrical signal to the electrode,

518
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Will the absorption of graphene be changed?

519
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We can estimate that the change is about 10 to the power of 4 to 10 to the power of 5.

520
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
If we want to do this detection,

521
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
The detection limit is 2 millivolts.

522
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
This is actually a very bad sensitivity.

523
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Because the electrical signals that nerve cells can generate

524
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's usually between tens of microvolts to hundreds of microvolts.

525
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
This is actually very, very bad.

526
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So our question is whether we can increase the modulation depth.

527
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
The method we use is to put graphene on a planar waveguide.

528
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
In this picture,

529
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Basically, this tantalum pentoxide has a relatively high refractive index.

530
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It is our planar waveguide.

531
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The light will spread inside.

532
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:32,000
The graphene is placed on the planar waveguide.

533
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
When the light passes through the graphene,

534
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The light will be absorbed.

535
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The absorption of light will be changed.

536
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
The graphene will be changed by the electrical signal.

537
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The absorption of light will be changed.

538
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The silicon dioxide layer and solution have a relatively low refractive index.

539
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
The light inside is evanescent.

540
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So it will be confined to the planar waveguide.

541
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
One of the concepts we use is called critical coupling.

542
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Basically, it looks like this.

543
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We put graphene on the planar waveguide.

544
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
You can imagine that when the light comes in,

545
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Because this is an evanescent wave,

546
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
The coupling of R1 will go into the waveguide.

547
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
When it reflects back,

548
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Some light will be absorbed by the graphene.

549
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So we write it as 1-α.

550
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
α is the absorption of graphene.

551
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So its reflection is R2.

552
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It is 1 minus the absorption of graphene.

553
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
When you consider these multiple interferences,

554
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Basically, you can write the electric field in this form.

555
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It is the square root of R1-R2 divided by the square root of R1-R2.

556
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
If you are doing photonics,

557
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You will find that this is exactly the same as the ring resonator.

558
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Basically, you have a beam of light coming in.

559
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
The ring resonator has a coefficient of T1 that will go into the waveguide.

560
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Here, we have a coefficient of R1 that will go into the waveguide.

561
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Here, we have a coefficient of R1 that will go into the waveguide.

562
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It goes through an α-absorption.

563
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Here is also an α-absorption.

564
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It goes back to the ring resonator.

565
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
If you are familiar with the ring resonator,

566
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You will know that this thing has a critical coupling.

567
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
The meaning of critical coupling is

568
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Because the R-absorption of the waveguide can be changed,

569
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
We set R1 to a constant and change R2.

570
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
When R1 is a constant, we set it to 0.95.

571
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
When R2 is small, R1 is about 1.

572
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You can put a value in and you will know.

573
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
When R2 is 1, the reflection is also 1.

574
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
When R2 is a small or large value, the reflection is large and the absorption is small.

575
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
But when R2 is equal to R1,

576
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
There is a place in the middle where the reflection is 0 and the absorption is 1.

577
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
The picture looks like this.

578
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
If we can change R2,

579
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
When R1 is small, the reflectance is large.

580
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
When R2 is large, the reflectance is also large.

581
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But there is a place in the middle where the absorption is very large and it can reach 100%.

582
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This is what we call critical coupling.

583
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Because R2 is the absorption of graphene,

584
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
We can use dopamine to change the alpha.

585
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Let R2 be equal to R1, then we have the largest absorption.

586
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:40,000
This is what the reflectance looks like.

587
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Basically, if we put a neurotransmitter in, the Fermi energy will change slightly.

588
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
We will see that the reflectivity will also change slightly.

589
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The concept is like this.

590
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
This is our optical setup.

591
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Basically, we use a prism to couple into the waveguide.

592
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Our light comes in like this.

593
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Basically, we look at the reflection of graphene and put it directly into an imaging system or a photodetector.

594
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
This is an experiment.

595
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Basically, we do this.

596
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:51,000
The first thing we do is to use an external voltage to change the Fermi energy of graphene.

597
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
When you change the Fermi energy of graphene, the absorption of graphene will change.

598
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Its relative reflectivity will also change.

599
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You can see that when the Fermi energy is small, the absorption of graphene is large.

600
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Basically, it will not be coupled in.

601
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:21,000
When the Fermi energy of graphene is large, the absorption will be small.

602
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It will not be coupled in, and the reflection will be large.

603
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Only when the absorption of graphene is just right, when R1 is equal to R2, there will be critical coupling.

604
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
The reflectivity of this place will be small, and the absorption will be large.

605
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
This is the place where the sensitivity is the largest.

606
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
We put the neurotransmitter in this place.

607
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
We put the external voltage field in this place.

608
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
When the neurotransmitter comes in, a light signal will come out.

609
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
We do this.

610
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
There is a DC value of 0.5.

611
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We add an AC signal on it.

612
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
We can directly see the change in the reflectivity of graphene.

613
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:25,000
According to our test, we can see that if we give a millivolt AC voltage,

614
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
the change in reflectivity is about 10 to the power of 2.

615
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Compared with the previous transmission method, it has improved by about 100 to 200 times.

616
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
We can see a change of about 15 microvolts.

617
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
We can directly see the action potential.

618
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
This is an imaging demonstration.

619
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,000
We can not only see the voltage change at a single point,

620
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
but also see the voltage change in the whole region, and it is timely.

621
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Finally, we do a bio-test.

622
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
We put a heart cell directly on graphene.

623
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
We can see the electrical signals.

624
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,000
The interesting signals are from the heart.

625
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Heart cells can move.

626
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
There are electrical signals and mechanical signals.

627
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
We use a chemical called burblast.

628
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:48,000
This chemical will make the heartbeat disappear.

629
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
There will be no more mechanical beating.

630
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
We can directly see the electrical signals.

631
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:04,000
This is a biological demonstration.

632
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Can you go back to the previous page?

633
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
This page?

634
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Your sharp peak is the electrical signal.

635
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
The first one is parallel, the third one is parallel, and the fourth one is crooked.

636
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
This cannot be directly compared.

637
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Before we add this chemical,

638
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
the heartbeat beats very regularly.

639
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It beats once every two seconds.

640
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
However, when you add this chemical,

641
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
the heart cells die slowly.

642
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
When we add this chemical, the heart cells die slowly.

643
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Finally, we use a camera to see the electrical signals.

644
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
We can see the electrical signals in the brighter area.

645
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
There is no electrical signal at the beginning.

646
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The electrical signal comes from the left side of the screen.

647
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It enters the middle and goes to the right side.

648
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It goes beyond the detection range.

649
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Each frame is about 5 milliseconds.

650
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
This is very timely.

651
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
The frame size is about 1 millimeter.

652
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It is very accurate.

653
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
We demonstrate this method.

654
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
We can see the electrical signals in one frame.

655
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
We can see the electrical signals in one frame.

656
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
In conclusion,

657
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
we use the properties of graphene.

658
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
First, it is very sensitive to the environment.

659
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Second, it can do doping.

660
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Doping can change the optical transition of graphene.

661
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
We develop optical sensors.

662
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:27,000
The first sensor is the chemical reaction near the graphene electrode.

663
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
The second sensor is the electrical signal in the graphene.

664
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
If we put nerve cells or heart cells on the graphene,

665
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
we hope to see the electrical signals.

666
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
This is our main work.

667
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This is the end of my speech.

668
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
These are my collaborators.

669
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
The first one is my boss.

670
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
These are PhD students or postdocs I have worked with.

671
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
These are other teachers.

672
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Thank you.

673
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Let's applaud Jason for his speech.

674
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Do you have any questions?

675
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Can I ask you a question?

676
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Sure.

677
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Can you go back to the first two PowerPoint slides?

678
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
In this setup,

679
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
you have a prism with light coming in.

680
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It interacts with the surface of the graphene.

681
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
This setup is often used to generate local plasmonic fields.

682
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Do you consider this?

683
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Or is it something you will look at in the future?

684
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The structure looks like local plasmonic.

685
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
But the concept is completely different.

686
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
There is no metal here.

687
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It's all dielectric.

688
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Our focus is on this.

689
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
We can control the thickness of the evanescent wave.

690
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Our focus is on controlling the thickness

691
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:33,000
to change the light coupling coefficient.

692
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
When you adjust the coefficient to the same as graphene,

693
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
you can design it to be the same as graphene.

694
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
This is when the critical coupling occurs.

695
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The assumption is 100%.

696
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So the sensitivity is theoretically infinite.

697
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
If all the light is absorbed,

698
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
a little change will cause a change from 0 to a certain intensity.

699
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
This is theoretically an infinite sensitivity.

700
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:14,000
This concept is the most important part of this device.

701
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I see.

702
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:25,000
We think this is a better way than plasma.

703
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
We are thinking about using this method to replace plasma.

704
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Many people are using plasma enhanced biosensors.

705
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Their claim is that they don't need labels.

706
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
They can do the same thing.

707
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
But I don't know if their sensitivity is as good as the claim.

708
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
The main problem with plasma is that it can't be imaged.

709
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
We can image this.

710
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
This is correct.

711
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
The sensitivity we are looking at is similar to plasma.

712
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Our system is not yet fully optimized.

713
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
0.5% of the light is still not absorbed.

714
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
If you want to optimize this process,

715
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
what do you need to change?

716
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Do you need to change the quality of the substrate?

717
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Or do you need to make it more optimized?

718
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So far, the only thing that hasn't been absorbed is graphene scattering.

719
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Do you mean graphene vibration scattering?

720
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Or other photonic scattering?

721
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
No, graphene is not homogeneous.

722
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's not homogeneous in space.

723
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Oh, so there's still a bit of revo on it.

724
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I see, I see.

725
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So if I have a completely flat graphene,

726
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
in theory, I can get 100% of it.

727
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
If you can get the same amount of graphene in every place,

728
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
then it should be very good.

729
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Okay, I see.

730
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But the graphene we use here is actually all CVD.

731
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
It's in the palm of your hand.

732
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
When it's in the palm of your hand, it's in pieces.

733
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
There are still some gaps in the middle.

734
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I see.

735
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So if you use a single crystal graphene,

736
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
for example, when you turn the CVD,

737
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
you don't want it to grow very big.

738
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
If you use a very small graphene,

739
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
will you get a very good result?

740
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
You just collect a very small signal.

741
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Yes, that's the theory.

742
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But what we want to demonstrate is that

743
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
we can have a large-scale detection.

744
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

745
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
If you want to do imaging,

746
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
you need a large-scale detection.

747
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I mean, as long as you don't let the graphene stack up,

748
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
it may be a very small point.

749
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Then if you use the ENCCD to collect the whole thing,

750
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
you will get the same signal at every point.

751
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You will get the same image.

752
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
As long as you don't let the graphene stack up,

753
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
it's okay.

754
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yes, that's right.

755
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
But now I don't know how big a single crystal can grow.

756
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I remember it was about 10 to 20 microns.

757
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So how big should each data point be

758
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
for you to collect such a good signal?

759
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, you mean...

760
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Our spatial resolution can be up to about 10 microns.

761
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
What is the limit of this thing?

762
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:32,000
For example, at 10 microns or lower,

763
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
under the ENCCD resolution scale,

764
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
these five microns...

765
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Okay, so in our pixel,

766
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
it's 10x10 microns.

767
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But maybe in some pixels,

768
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
the graphene coverage is 80%.

769
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
In some places, the graphene coverage is 50%.

770
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Then the response of these two places will be different.

771
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
When one place is critical coupling,

772
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
the other pixel will not be critical coupling.

773
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Okay.

774
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So on average,

775
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
you won't be completely critical coupling.

776
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
So have you ever thought about

777
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
getting a sample out of a tapestry?

778
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
We haven't thought about it before.

779
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Actually, we can try it.

780
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Because what we've been thinking about is

781
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
that we have to find a way to make it very large

782
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
so that we can see the entire neural network at once.

783
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Got it. Thank you.

784
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Anyone else have any questions?

785
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
No questions?

786
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Anyone has a question? Sorry.

787
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
No, thank you.

788
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Thank you.

789
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Very good talk.

790
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Okay.

791
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Thank you.

792
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
If there are no questions,

793
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
let's give Jason another round of applause

794
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
for bringing us today's talk.

795
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Okay, that's it for today.

796
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I'll turn off the recording first.
