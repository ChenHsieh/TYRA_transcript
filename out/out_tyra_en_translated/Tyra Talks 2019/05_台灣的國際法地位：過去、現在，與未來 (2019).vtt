00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Welcome everyone to today's Terra Talk, we are very honored to invite our speaker, Mr. Huang Shengfeng, to tell us about today's topic, Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
I am very happy, because we have a long time in fact, there are no humanities or social science-related speeches.

00:27.000 --> 00:36.000
Today, it is easy to invite Mr. Shengfeng, and Mr. Shengfeng is now in Edinburgh, he is 12 o'clock in the middle of the night to speak for everyone, so thank him very much.

00:37.000 --> 00:50.000
First, let me introduce the background of Shengfeng. Shengfeng is the founder of Taipeng International Law, the founder of the Taiwan Voter Alliance.

00:50.000 --> 01:10.000
He previously studied law at Taipei University and the Law Department of Taipei University, and then studied international law at the University of London, and now studies international law at Edinburgh University.

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
He is going to talk to us about the topic of Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.

01:20.000 --> 01:33.000
A small reminder, if you don't turn on the microphone, you can't hear the applause, so let's turn on the microphone together, and thank Shengfeng for bringing us today's speech.

01:40.000 --> 01:52.000
Hello everyone, I am Huang Shengfeng. Today I am very happy to have this opportunity to share with you some of the results of my research so far.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
My research topic is Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.

02:00.000 --> 02:14.000
At the beginning of the speech, I would like to share a sentence with everyone. This is what Albus Dumbledore said in Harry Potter.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Sometimes we must choose between what is right and what is easy.

02:44.000 --> 02:57.000
In the end, it created today's situation. When we want to solve some problems in the future, we must continue to face many choices.

02:57.000 --> 03:08.000
I don't know if the Taiwanese will choose the right choice or the simple and easy choice. I think this may determine our future.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
At the beginning of this speech, I hope everyone can keep this sentence in mind.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
Later, when I talk about the content, you can take this sentence out from time to time and think about it.

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
At that time, what did the Taiwanese think or what choices did the Taiwanese make in the end? What should we do in the future?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
There are three main topics I want to share today. The first is the background knowledge of international law.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
The second is the past and present of international law. The last is the future.

03:46.000 --> 04:00.000
The background knowledge of international law is because most of the people who come to listen to my presentation today are not legal background.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
So they may not know much about this aspect. I want to do some basic background explanation first.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Then I will start to talk about our internal topics.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
First of all, we need to understand what international law is.

04:17.000 --> 04:26.000
International law is the basic rule of law between political entities.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
What is the political entity on international law?

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
Basically, it includes the so-called sovereign state.

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
The second is the so-called international organization, such as the United Nations, WHO, and WTO.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
These are also political entities on international law.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
The other is the implementation of autonomous units, such as Taiwan or Somaliland.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
I put Taiwan in the implementation of autonomous units, not in the country.

04:58.000 --> 05:12.000
This means that at least so far, under the definition of international law, Taiwan has not yet been recognized as a sovereign state.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Of course, everyone may have different ideas.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
But from the perspective of international law, Taiwan is not yet.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Of course, I will say why it is not.

05:22.000 --> 05:31.000
In addition, international law is the principle that determines the rights and obligations of the political entity on international law and its right to carry out its obligations.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
The scope of international law is actually very wide.

05:34.000 --> 05:43.000
Generally, when people hear international law, they sometimes feel that it is related to a place, a country, or diplomacy.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
In fact, the scope of international law is very wide, including political, economic, military, and human rights.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
For example, international relations, diplomacy, and business.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
Then there is economic, import-export trade, currency exchange, financial transactions, and securities transactions.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
In fact, today some people say that international law does not seem to have any effect.

06:05.000 --> 06:15.000
In fact, if we want to implement import-export trade, or even if we want to study abroad,

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
or when you go sightseeing and need to exchange foreign currency, this is also related to international law.

06:20.000 --> 06:29.000
Even now, some people may be in the United States, and then you can buy and sell securities and goods from other countries.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
These financial transactions are all related to international law.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
Then, for example, the military part, such as hand-to-hand combat, stop-and-go, how to end the war, military occupation.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Then, for example, the restrictions on nuclear and biological weapons.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
For example, recently, the US withdrew the Semiconductor Missile Agreement.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
These are all related to the military.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
Then, for example, the human rights part, such as the right to freedom, the right to self-determination, the right to life, the right to transport, and the human rights law.

07:03.000 --> 07:18.000
In fact, basically, we can say that as long as you have a connection with other countries, no matter what form of connection it is, it will be related to international law.

07:18.000 --> 07:26.000
Hearing international law, there is often a reaction that international law is bigger and more powerful than fist.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
However, it must be emphasized here that international law is not only bigger than fist.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
Because if it is really bigger than fist, I believe that the biggest fist in the world now is the United States.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
But even if the United States has such a big fist, it can't stop it.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
That is, the wife of Palestine, she was born in front of the United Nations.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
The United States is only one vote in the United Nations, in the General Assembly, and in the Security Council.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
So it can't decide everything, although its fist may be the biggest in the world.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
In addition, for example, China, of course, can't prevent the International Court of Justice from making a judgment against it.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
Of course, at this time, some people will say that although it is said that it is not conducive to its judgment, China is still my heart and my tree.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
But we have to think a little bit, that is, yes, that's right.

08:16.000 --> 08:28.000
Although the Philippine was against the South China Sea part of the International Court of Justice, and then the International Court of Justice put China on it.

08:28.000 --> 08:38.000
Later, the International Court of Justice made some of China's claims that there was no legal effect, that is, it did not have those rights.

08:38.000 --> 08:49.000
Although China later decided not to recognize these things, other countries made such a decision because of the International Court of Justice.

08:49.000 --> 08:58.000
So other countries, such as the United States, claimed that since the International Court of Justice believed that the right to claim did not exist,

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
then I followed the rules of the International Court of Justice, such as the International Ocean Law, and I exercised my freedom of navigation.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
There are other countries, such as the United Kingdom, who are also exercising their freedom of navigation.

09:08.000 --> 09:21.000
When other countries make a decision because of you, such as the International Court of Justice, and then let other countries obtain other basis on the International Law to exercise their rights, this is the effect of the International Law.

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
So what the International Law represents is to tell everyone that there is more than just a fist in the international community.

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
Because even if you have a fist as big as China, and then it is not willing to recognize the decision made by the International Court of Justice,

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
but other countries can still act according to the judgment made by the International Court of Justice.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
At this time, even if China is dissatisfied, it can only look aside.

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
In this regard, I would like to let everyone know that the strong can set the rules, and the weak must comply with the rules.

09:59.000 --> 10:12.000
The International Law is actually a decision made by the great powers and the strong to discuss and make a political decision.

10:13.000 --> 10:31.000
The main purpose of the International Law is to allow different countries to solve disputes in a civilized and legal way, rather than a rapid war.

10:31.000 --> 10:42.000
So in this case, we can know that the International Law is to some extent a bit like a structure on the balance of danger.

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
So in this case, even if it is a big country, it will feel that it is necessary to comply with the International Law.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
Because if it does not comply with the International Law, other big countries may not comply with the International Law, and then it will be a mess.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
In the event that everyone gives up their strength, it may be the end of the world.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
For countries that are not strong, the strength is not so strong.

11:08.000 --> 11:16.000
In fact, it is more important to understand what the rules are made by these big countries, and then to make good use of these rules.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
Because in this case, you are not saying that you are bigger than the fist, you are a small fist against a big fist, you will win.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
But if you follow the rules of the International Law, the rules of the International Law are a rule created by the power.

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
When you follow the rules created by the power to deal with other powers, you are like standing on the shoulders of a giant.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Although you may be a small person, you are standing on the shoulders of a giant.

11:40.000 --> 11:52.000
The International Law is actually very useful, and in fact, for the weaker object, the greater the impact of the International Law, the stronger the meaning.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
In fact, here I want to mention a simple example.

11:54.000 --> 12:07.000
For example, after the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, it took 22 years and 24 days for it to become the representative government of China in the United Nations on October 25, 1971.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
On October 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution No. 2758 was passed.

12:13.000 --> 12:22.000
According to that resolution, the representative of China in the United Nations is the representative of the People's Republic of China.

12:22.000 --> 12:39.000
So we all know that although the People's Republic of China came to Taiwan because of the civil war, and the so-called mainland China was controlled by the People's Republic of China.

12:39.000 --> 12:49.000
But even though the power is so different, the People's Republic of China also took more than 20 years to enter the United Nations.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
So it's not that it's really bigger than the fist. If it's really bigger than the fist, it should have entered earlier, and it wouldn't have waited more than 20 years.

12:57.000 --> 13:11.000
Then again, like Palestine, it was after the independence of Palestine was announced on November 15, 1988. It took 24 years and 14 days for it to become a member of the United Nations.

13:11.000 --> 13:23.000
So we find that whether it is a strong, stronger foundation of the People's Republic of China, or a very weak Palestine.

13:23.000 --> 13:32.000
But after they were established, it took a long time for them to enter the international community, for example, to enter the United Nations.

13:33.000 --> 13:39.000
So we know that whether it is strong or weak, the international law has a certain impact on them.

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
I am here to talk about the United Nations, because whether it is the People's Republic of China regime or Palestine,

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
they entered the United Nations today in accordance with the regulations set by the United Nations itself.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
Of course, the regulations set by the United Nations International Organization also follow the regulations set by the international law.

14:00.000 --> 14:10.000
So basically everyone follows the regulations of the international law. No one says that I have a big fist today, so I can listen to me directly.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
Or that I am very weak, so everyone has to pity me. In fact, there is no such thing.

14:16.000 --> 14:27.000
So I think that the international law has the greatest effect on the weak, which is to increase the competition with the strong, and then the political and legal defense.

14:27.000 --> 14:41.000
In fact, this is especially important for Taiwan. I think that many people who come to participate today may have a nationality from other countries, for example, you may have a nationality in the United States.

14:42.000 --> 14:55.000
Maybe you don't feel so strongly about this, but if you say that the nationality you have today or the place you are in is a relatively weak place in international politics or international relations,

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
in fact, you will feel that if everyone is just a fist, there is not much effect.

15:02.000 --> 15:11.000
But if there is an international law as a backer, when you go to fight for some rights with others, you will have the opportunity to get what you want.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Can I ask a question?

15:15.000 --> 15:25.000
You just said that there are three kinds of political entities in the world, the state, the WHO, and Taiwan or Somaliland.

15:26.000 --> 15:35.000
Then you just had a statement that all interactions between countries must abide by international law.

15:35.000 --> 15:45.000
I want to ask that the object of the international law is actually the country, that is, the ABC of the three A or ABC?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
ABC.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
So all three are required?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yes.

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
Because I just said that the basic interactions between political entities in international law are regulated.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
So the political entities in international law include those three things.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
OK, thank you.

16:09.000 --> 16:19.000
I think everyone has heard of the four elements of a country, namely territory, people, and government.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Then there is sovereignty.

16:22.000 --> 16:40.000
For example, if you were educated in Taiwan, you would probably know the four elements of a country, namely territory, people, government, and sovereignty.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
But I want to tell you that this statement is wrong.

16:45.000 --> 16:57.000
The reason is that sovereignty is something that a country will have after it is formed.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
So it is not a basic element that constitutes a country.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
It is something that you will have after you become a country.

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
So if you say that sovereignty is an element that constitutes a country, this is a bit of a logical question.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
Basically, it should be said that it is not the so-called four elements, but the characteristics that a sovereign country should have.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
That is, in the Montevideo Convention on the Rights of the Nation, it talks about territory, people, and government.

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
In addition, there is the so-called diplomatic ability, which is the ability to communicate with other sovereign countries.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
I particularly emphasize the ability to communicate with other sovereign countries.

17:45.000 --> 17:55.000
And the important thing is that the sovereign country must treat you as a sovereign country.

17:55.000 --> 18:06.000
When you communicate with the so-called official position, your diplomatic ability is truly recognized.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
So in fact, a country, a very interesting thing is that the so-called sovereign country needs to have characteristics,

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
In addition to those entities that can be seen, such as territory, people, and government,

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
The other part of the diplomatic ability is actually directly linked to the so-called recognition part.

18:25.000 --> 18:32.000
In fact, of course, some people say that you are or are not a country today, and you do not need other countries to recognize you.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
But now the question is whether you are a country or whether you can play the role of a country.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
In fact, it depends on whether other countries treat you as a country.

18:46.000 --> 18:57.000
So whether or not you are recognized today is the key to becoming a country.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.000
But to be recognized by other countries, to recognize that you are a country, is to allow you to operate like a country,

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
Or like a country, a basic prerequisite for connecting with other countries.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
So in fact, when we have the so-called territory today, and the people have the government,

19:17.000 --> 19:25.000
Then, with the diplomatic ability to be equal to other countries, you will have a so-called sovereign thing.

19:25.000 --> 19:35.000
In fact, the form of sovereign performance is that it can control or manage the land and people internally,

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Then you can have diplomatic relations with other countries.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
So in fact, sovereign countries need to have these characteristics.

19:46.000 --> 19:54.000
Basically, we can say that if it is a country, it will have these characteristics.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
But having these characteristics does not mean that you are a country.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
This is a bit logical, that is, if P is Q, if it is not Q, it is not P.

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
But you can't say that if P is Q, then if it is not P, then it is not Q. This logic is wrong.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
OK, here is another basic knowledge.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
That is, we have to distinguish between the so-called country, the government, and the regime.

20:24.000 --> 20:32.000
The so-called country is a political entity with international law that dominates the national legal personality.

20:32.000 --> 20:39.000
The regime is a political group with practical power and governance ability.

20:39.000 --> 20:47.000
So if there is a group of people today and they form an organization,

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
Then that organization has practical control and can govern a certain place and govern a certain people.

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
We can say that the organization built by this group of people is a so-called regime.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
Then there is another so-called government. The government is a government that can represent the country, that is, represent the country externally.

21:09.000 --> 21:18.000
Then internally, it can govern the people and the land, and it is a regime that conducts diplomacy externally.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
The distinction between this place and this place is very important.

21:22.000 --> 21:30.000
Because if we put these three things together today, we will often have problems when we judge some problems.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
Especially when facing the situation in Taiwan.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
There are a few points here. The first is that a country can only have a government that represents the country, the so-called government.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
The representative government is a regime that can represent the country.

21:47.000 --> 21:56.000
So we know that the representative government is a regime, but this regime has another special nature, that is, it can represent the country.

21:56.000 --> 22:05.000
In a country, there may be several regimes at the same time, and these several regimes are in the so-called representative government.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
If there is such a situation, it is the so-called representative power struggle.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
The most direct example is China, which is related to Taiwan.

22:16.000 --> 22:25.000
From October 1, 1949 to today, the representative power struggle between the People's Republic of China government and the People's Republic of China government.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
I also wrote the government here. In fact, we all know that they call themselves the government.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
In fact, it is the regime of the People's Republic of China and the regime of the People's Republic of China.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
They are fighting for the position of the Chinese representative government.

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
Which one wins will become the so-called Chinese government, the Chinese representative government.

22:44.000 --> 22:51.000
The other is Venezuela. Venezuela just happened this year.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
We know that the government of Maduro, and then there was a government of Guaido.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Guaido is a leader of the ruling party.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
He thinks that the election of the Maduro government was problematic.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
He does not recognize the election result.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
In addition, Maduro's previous governance had a big problem.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
There was a very big financial problem in Venezuela.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Guaido felt that he could not do it.

23:24.000 --> 23:32.000
He appointed himself as the temporary president and established the so-called transitional government.

23:32.000 --> 23:41.000
The interesting thing here is that the United States was the first to recognize that Guaido's transitional government was the representative government of Venezuela.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
The Maduro government is not the representative government.

23:45.000 --> 23:59.000
The interesting thing here is that other countries can choose which regime is the representative government of another country.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
After their choice, they will follow their choice to deal with the government of this country.

24:06.000 --> 24:15.000
For example, after the Maduro government decided to recognize Guaido's transitional government in the United States,

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
it ordered the U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela.

24:21.000 --> 24:31.000
The U.S. government's response is that we now recognize that Guaido's transitional government is the legitimate government of Venezuela.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Since the U.S. government is not the legitimate government of Venezuela,

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
the U.S. government's request to the U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela is illegal.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
The U.S. government does not recognize this request.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
So the U.S. diplomats continue to stay in Venezuela.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
This is actually a very interesting situation.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
We know that countries have various characteristics.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
Some of these characteristics are necessary, while some are not.

25:02.000 --> 25:11.000
Let's see how these characteristics will change after the change.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
First, let's talk about nationality.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Every country has a nationality, which is its name.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Of course, it can be changed, but its change will not affect its legal personality.

25:20.000 --> 25:32.000
For example, if my name is Huang Shengfeng, and if I change my name to Lai Qingde, I will not become the former director of the Executive Yuan.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
The same goes for countries.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
After the country's nationality is changed, its national legal personality will not change.

25:40.000 --> 25:47.000
A recent example is that Swaziland was renamed Swaziland in 2018.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
Another example is that the Qing Dynasty changed its name to the Republic of China in 1912.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
I say that the Republic of China was renamed.

25:55.000 --> 26:04.000
You may think that the Republic of China was not founded by Sun Wen to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.

26:04.000 --> 26:11.000
In fact, the Republic of China was founded by Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty issued a decree of abdication in 1912.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
In this decree, he announced that the Qing Dynasty would be changed from an imperial system to a republic system.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
The Qing Dynasty would become the Great Republic of China, which was allied with the Han Dynasty.

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty appointed Yuan Shikai as the temporary government.

26:32.000 --> 26:43.000
The Qing Dynasty changed from an imperial system to a republic system.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
The Qing Dynasty changed its name to the Republic of China.

26:47.000 --> 26:57.000
The Qing Dynasty was later replaced by Yuan Shikai's temporary government.

26:57.000 --> 27:04.000
Some people may not believe it, but I want to make it simple.

27:04.000 --> 27:13.000
In the 6th year of the Republic of China, the so-called Xuantong 9th year,

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
there was a thing called Zhang Xun's abdication.

27:17.000 --> 27:24.000
If you have read the history of the Republic of China textbooks, you will know the so-called Zhang Xun's abdication.

27:24.000 --> 27:31.000
Zhang Xun's abdication means that the Republic of China changed from a republic system to an imperial system.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
So Puyi ascended the throne again.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Let's think about one thing.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
If the Qing Dynasty was overthrown today, if this country was overthrown,

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
and the Republic of China was a new country, how could you change it back?

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
It's just a simple change of a system, and then the name was changed and changed again.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
If you are building a new country today, how could you change it like this?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
In fact, it's not.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
Because the Republic of China itself is the Qing Dynasty itself.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
It just changed the system and changed the name.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
So when Zhang Xun abdicated, because it was the same, it was able to return to its previous state.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
So Zhang Xun's abdication tells us that the Republic of China is the same as the Qing Dynasty.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
It's just a different name. It's just a different system.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
This is actually the so-called renaissance constitution.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
We can think of it this way.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
In fact, this is the renaissance constitution.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
The Qing Dynasty changed the name to the Republic of China.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Originally, the Qing Dynasty did not have a constitution.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
Later, the Republic of China was changed to a temporary constitution.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
It is the so-called renaissance constitution.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
The renaissance constitution is no different from the constitutional constitution advocated by some people today.

28:50.000 --> 28:58.000
So I found that if you change the name of a country, change its system, or make some regulations,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
it will not affect the nature of this country.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Another so-called government.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
If necessary, it can be changed.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Its change does not affect the national law.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Let me give you an example.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
In 1928, China's representative government changed from the US government to the national government.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
The textbooks of the Republic of China tell us that

29:23.000 --> 29:30.000
Jiang Jieshi led the North and later unified China.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
The North was successful.

29:32.000 --> 29:40.000
In fact, the process of the whole North was the so-called Beiyang government, the representative government of China.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
It was overthrown by the rebellious government.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
That is to say, before the completion of the North,

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
Jiang Jieshi led the so-called national government.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
In fact, it was a rebellious government.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
After the rebellious government successfully overthrew the original representative government,

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
there was no other government in the Republic of China to compete with it.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
So the national government became the representative government of the Republic of China.

30:11.000 --> 30:18.000
Other countries originally came to the Republic of China with the Beiyang government.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
Later, the Beiyang government was eliminated and replaced by the national government.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Other countries continue to come to the national government.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
They are from the same country, but they still come from China.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
They just come from different governments.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
In fact, this is the meaning of the civil war in the Republic of China.

30:38.000 --> 30:45.000
The civil war in the Republic of China is that the national government meets another competitor.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
The system can be changed when necessary.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Its change does not affect the national law.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
Here, we mentioned that China changed from a geological system to a republic system in 1912.

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
For example, France changed from a geological system to a republic system in the French Revolution in 1792.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
We know that France is now the fifth republic.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
In other words, after the French Revolution, it first became a republic system.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
So we know that a country's system can be changed.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
Geological system, republic system, etc.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
But the country is still the same.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Otherwise, we would not talk about the so-called French Revolution.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
They are all from the same country.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It's just a system change.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
In addition, there is the Constitution.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
The Constitution is not necessary.

31:46.000 --> 31:56.000
Because if the Constitution is necessary, we will find that there may be no country before the so-called military constitution.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
In fact, it is not.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
Because before the military constitution, all countries are monarchical systems.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
There is no Constitution.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
But these countries still exist.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
Even to this day, they still belong to the imperial system.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
For example, we have some chief states on the Arabian Peninsula.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
These chief states are the imperial system.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
They do not have the Constitution.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
The Constitution is re-created and revised.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
No matter how many times, it does not affect the order of the National Security Council.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Or change it.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
For example, I can say that the French constitution is 17 times.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
You may be surprised.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
The French constitution is 17 times.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Re-created.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Not revised.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Re-created 17 times.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
The latest constitution has been revised 24 times.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
But we will not say that the French constitution is 17 times.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
So France died and was born again.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Died and was born again.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
More than ten times.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
We do not think so.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
It is still the same country.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
So, the Constitution or the revision of the Constitution will not affect the national character.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
In addition, there is the state flag.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
The state flag is actually unnecessary.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
No one stipulates that the country must have a state flag.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
But that is a symbol.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
So usually there will be.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
To change it will not affect the national character.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
The national anthem is the same.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
Here we will start to enter the topic.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Taiwan's international law status.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Here we have to define what Taiwan is.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
Taiwan actually has several definitions.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
The most common is that

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
In the current range of the People's Republic of China regime.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Including Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
There are other regions controlled by the regime in reality.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
For example, Dongsha Island, Taiping Island.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
These places.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
The other is Guangyi.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
That is the so-called island of Taiwan.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
With its affiliated islands.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Then there is Penghu Island.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
This is Guangyi.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
That is the island of Taiwan.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
With its affiliated islands.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
That is not included in Penghu Island.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
That is the island of Taiwan.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
In today's briefing.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Unless I list Penghu at the same time today.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Otherwise, basically speaking.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
This is Guangyi.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
This is the island of Taiwan.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
With its affiliated islands.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Then there is Penghu Island.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
That does not include other places.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
So it does not include Kinmen, Mazu.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
And Dongsha, Taiping.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
These places.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
In fact, the past of Taiwan.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
In fact, history is very long.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
But because what we are going to talk about today.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
It is relatively close to the modern history of Taiwan.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So I think I will.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Probably from Taiwan and China.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Began to be involved.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
For example, modern China.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Let's start with less involved places.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
But in this place.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
We can take a look first.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
This is the Qing Dynasty.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
The emperor of the Qing Dynasty.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
This is Emperor Yongzheng.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
He said.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Taiwan has not belonged to China since ancient times.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
The imperial examination of the God of War revealed the map.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The imperial examination of the God of War revealed the map.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
This is the father of Emperor Yongzheng.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Also Emperor Kangxi.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
In other words.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
This place in Taiwan.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
Until Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
To really enter the so-called map of China.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
But before that.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Basically speaking.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Taiwan is not part of China.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
So we know.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
People's Republic of China.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Now claim that Taiwan is part of China.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
The indivisible part.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Since ancient times.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
We know.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
In fact, many people do not agree with the facts.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
In this place.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I think there are some points.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
For example.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Because I'm talking about this now.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
China is related to Taiwan.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
And it is related to modern Taiwan.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
So we jump directly.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Jump to 1662.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
Is the part of Zheng Chenggong's defeat of the Netherlands.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Before that.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Is that.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Other western countries.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
The part of the people of Taiwan.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
The place has jumped.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
In 1662.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Zheng Chenggong's defeat of the Netherlands.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
We know.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
The so-called anti-Qing people.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Later.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Not long after he came to Taiwan.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Died.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
His son.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Zheng Jing.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Later.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Established the so-called Donglin Kingdom.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
That.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Donglin Kingdom.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
On the island of Taiwan.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Is.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
More.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
The Chinese side.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Is.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
In fact.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
In Taiwan.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
More.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
The beginning of a systematic degeneration.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Then.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
In 1683.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
In the 7th month of the Donglin Kingdom.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
When he was at the Penghu Sea War.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
He was defeated by the Qing Empire.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Then.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Surrender in September.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
In October.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Enter the sea.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Enter Taiwan.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Then he surrendered.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
So at this time.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Because.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
The Qing Empire.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Then.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
This.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
The Qing Empire.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Emperor Kangxi.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Later.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Decided.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
To take Taiwan.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Into the so-called territory.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Of course.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
That is to say.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
The Qing Empire itself.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
In.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Defeated.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Zheng Chenggong.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Defeated.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
After the Donglin Kingdom.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Is.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
To take Taiwan into.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
This.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
The territory of the Qing Empire.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Inside.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
They also have a fight.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
But later.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Anyway.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
After a fight.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
So I still decided.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
All right.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Let's take Taiwan into the territory.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
But.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
No active management.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Then.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
In 1867.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
This.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
The so-called United States.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
The Rovahao Incident.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
That is.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
The United States.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Uploaded.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
He is.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
In the east.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
Here.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Then.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Later.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Accidentally.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Into.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
This.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Taiwan's territory.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Then.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
As a result.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Later.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Many people were fired.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
That.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Living.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Living people.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Run.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Go to the Qing Empire.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
A small report.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
As a result.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
The Qing Empire said.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Then he.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Do not care.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
From this place.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
You can see.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
One thing.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
That is.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
For the Qing Empire.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
For the Qing Empire.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
The so-called deep.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
He does not think.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Is his own territory.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
That is.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
He can't control.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
The place.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
He thinks.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
That is not actually his territory.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
So.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
It's not his territory.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Within the scope of things.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
It's not.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
He can manage.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
So.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
We can see from this place.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
That is.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
The Qing Empire.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Basically.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
What is his position?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
On this island.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
On this island.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
He can control.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
What is the position of the scope?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
That.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
The United States.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Of course.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Very angry.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Ah.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
That's good.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Since you don't care.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Then I'll do it myself.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
So.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
The United States.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
He himself.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Send troops away.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
To Taiwan.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
So.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
This is the U.S. Marine Corps.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Just.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Landed in Taiwan.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Then.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
To this.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
The native of the Taiwanese people.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Just.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Fight with him.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
As a result.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Since defeated.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Lost.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
This.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Now this is.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
The U.S. Marine Corps.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Everyone knows.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Hey.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Almost everyone hears it.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Wen Feng.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Wen Feng.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
That's it.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Wen Feng.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
That's it.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Hey.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
This.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Is very powerful.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
But they lost to this.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
The native of Taiwan.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
So.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
You can know.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
The native of Taiwan.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Really.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Very arrogant.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
So he.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
The United States.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
These.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
The Marines.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Attack the native of Taiwan.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Return in the rain.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Later.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Three months later.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Just.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
In Langqiao.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
With the head of the 18th Division of the Taiwan Army.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
This.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
This.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
Zhou Qidu.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
He fought with him.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Then.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
He signed the so-called.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Alliance of the Southern Xia.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Then.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Officially ended.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
This.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Luo Fahao Incident.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Then.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
This Alliance of the Southern Xia.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Basically.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
That is to say.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
In the future.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
If there is a ship.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
In case of.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
What kind of.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
When the shipwreck happened.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Then.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
If they say.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Raised a.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
What label.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
For example.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Raised a red flag.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Then.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
The United States.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
This.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Is.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
A kind of agreement.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
That.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
From this place.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
We can see that.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
This.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
The United States.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
With.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
The aborigines.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
They signed.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Such an agreement.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
But.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Signed such an agreement.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Is it representative of.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
This.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
The Taiwan Army 18th Division.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
They.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
In the eyes of the United States.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Is.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
A country.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
In fact, this.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
To put on a question mark.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Just.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Because in fact.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
This is the US government.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
They are with.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Under the international law.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Modern.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Under the international law.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
The sovereign state.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
The same.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Can sign some agreements.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Sign some agreements.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
So.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Even if it is.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Signed such an agreement.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
It does not mean that.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
At that time.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
The United States.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Is.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
This.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Taiwan Army 18th Division.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
This piece.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Recognize it.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Is a country.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
But what we can be sure of is.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
He thinks.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
He is with a regime.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Is signing.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Just.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Because he thinks.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
He can control that place.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
A regime.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
And then.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
In.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
In.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
After more than a year.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
This.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Li Xian.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Again.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
With that.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Zhuo Qidu.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
In China.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
The customs tax officer.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Under the witness.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Signing a memorandum of understanding.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
That's here.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
I'm talking about.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Under the witness.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
So we know that.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
This.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
This Chinese customs.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
The official.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
He is just a witness.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
He is not the party.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
So we know that.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
In this case.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
It is a very.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
It is a very.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
It is a very.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
It is a very.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
It is a very.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
It's a very.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
It's a very.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
It's a very.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
It's a very very memorable.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
It's a very memorable.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
In this case it's a very interesting thing.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
The United States and.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
With this.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Signed with him.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
This thing.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
China's third-person role.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
China's third-person role.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
challenged

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Be a witness.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
China's third-person role.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Not be a person's character.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Not be Person's anime.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
It can be seen from this that it means that China does not really believe that that place is his territory.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Then there was an event at the peony bazaar in 1878 lecture.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Then there was an event at the peony bazaar in 1878 lecture.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Many people know.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
It is.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Liu Lib LA.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Liu Lib LA.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
OK.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Liu Lib LA.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
OK.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
It is happening for thevious reasons.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
It is happening for vicious reasons.

41:47.000 --> 41:53.000
After it, the land was villagers encountered with native people.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
After it, the land was villagers encountered with native people.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Then some peko подборFF Escaped by battle.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.700
At this time,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
In the imperial State of Japan,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
In the imperial State of Japan,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.200
during the great British competition with the King

42:08.200 --> 42:09.000
toward the imperial State of the New Republic.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
during the great British competition with the King

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
The曷ren commander of the Imperial Japanese Palace

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
The曷ren commander of the Imperial Japanese Palace

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Recently, he Roosevelt asked

42:23.000 --> 42:23.000


42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Recently, he Roosevelt asked

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
The one who killed the King of Taiwan

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
The one who killed the King of Taiwan

42:29.000 --> 42:30.760
You are not the King of the Empire

42:30.760 --> 42:32.000
You are not the king of the empire

42:32.000 --> 42:35.460
The great New Empire not to

42:35.460 --> 42:35.460


42:35.460 --> 42:35.460


42:35.460 --> 42:37.460
The great New Empire

42:37.460 --> 42:39.460
The great New Empire

42:39.460 --> 42:43.460
King's imperial reuse

42:43.460 --> 42:45.460
King's imperial rebirth

42:45.460 --> 42:45.460


42:45.460 --> 42:47.460
The great New Empire said

42:47.460 --> 42:50.460
This is a self-degraded rebirth

42:50.460 --> 42:52.460
In other words

42:52.460 --> 42:53.460
The great New Empire said

42:53.460 --> 42:54.460
These people can't control

42:54.460 --> 42:55.460
So we found that

42:55.460 --> 42:56.460
It's the same as the Roosevelt incident

42:56.460 --> 42:59.460
The attitude of the great New Empire is like this

42:59.460 --> 43:01.460
The attitude of Japan is OK

43:01.460 --> 43:02.460
Well, since that's the case

43:02.460 --> 43:04.460
You think these

43:04.460 --> 43:07.460
The place where the rebirth is located is not your territory

43:07.460 --> 43:08.460
Then you can't control these

43:08.460 --> 43:10.460
Then I'll take care of it, right?

43:10.460 --> 43:13.460
Because I think the Great Japanese Empire said

43:13.460 --> 43:15.460
I think the King of the Empire

43:15.460 --> 43:17.460
It's also my territory

43:17.460 --> 43:19.460
So I want to protect my territory

43:19.460 --> 43:21.460
So I'm going to punish

43:21.460 --> 43:24.460
These rebirths in Taiwan

43:24.460 --> 43:27.460
So Japan sent troops to the so-called five main regions

43:27.460 --> 43:30.460
Five main regions

43:30.460 --> 43:31.460
So later

43:31.460 --> 43:33.460
Japan, of course, sent troops to attack

43:33.460 --> 43:35.460
Mutan Temple, Kaosifu Temple

43:35.460 --> 43:37.460
And then

43:37.460 --> 43:39.460
After defeating these aborigines

43:39.460 --> 43:42.460
He camped in that place

43:42.460 --> 43:43.460
For the Great Japanese Empire

43:43.460 --> 43:45.460
It's actually a very embarrassing thing

43:45.460 --> 43:48.460
That is

43:48.460 --> 43:49.460
You are the Great Japanese Empire

43:49.460 --> 43:51.460
You go to this island of Taiwan today

43:51.460 --> 43:53.460
You have to go

43:53.460 --> 43:54.460
For your

43:54.460 --> 43:56.460
The fishermen of the King of the Empire

43:56.460 --> 43:58.460
Go to

43:58.460 --> 44:00.460
It's OK to achieve justice

44:00.460 --> 44:02.460
But after you go there to fight

44:02.460 --> 44:03.460
You stay there

44:03.460 --> 44:04.460
No

44:04.460 --> 44:05.460
Because he

44:05.460 --> 44:06.460
The Great Japanese Empire still thinks that

44:06.460 --> 44:07.460
The island of Taiwan is mainly his

44:07.460 --> 44:08.460
Although Japan is there

44:08.460 --> 44:09.460
Stay there

44:09.460 --> 44:11.460
What do you think

44:11.460 --> 44:13.460
So the Great Japanese Empire later

44:13.460 --> 44:14.460
To find a way

44:14.460 --> 44:15.460
To get rid of these things

44:15.460 --> 44:16.460
So later

44:16.460 --> 44:19.460
Through the intervention of the British Empire

44:19.460 --> 44:22.460
Then signed the Beijing Treaty

44:22.460 --> 44:23.460
After that

44:23.460 --> 44:25.460
It's agreed in it

44:25.460 --> 44:28.460
After that, these places on the island of Taiwan

44:28.460 --> 44:29.460
These rebirths

44:29.460 --> 44:31.460
The Great Japanese Empire has to find a way

44:31.460 --> 44:33.460
To restrain

44:33.460 --> 44:35.460
In fact, to some extent

44:35.460 --> 44:37.460
This also means that

44:37.460 --> 44:38.460
Britain is here

44:38.460 --> 44:39.460
It's a statement

44:39.460 --> 44:40.460
All right

44:40.460 --> 44:41.460
People in these places

44:41.460 --> 44:42.460
Basically

44:42.460 --> 44:44.460
Or you have to manage

44:44.460 --> 44:45.460
Or you have to manage

44:45.460 --> 44:46.460
You have to manage

44:46.460 --> 44:48.460
I think it's a bit like admitting

44:48.460 --> 44:50.460
The place where those rebirths are

44:50.460 --> 44:52.460
In fact, it is still the territory of the Great Japanese Empire

44:52.460 --> 44:53.460
So people in these places

44:53.460 --> 44:54.460
You have to manage

44:54.460 --> 44:56.460
such

44:56.460 --> 44:58.460
In 1885

44:58.460 --> 45:00.460
The Great Japanese Empire finally

45:00.460 --> 45:02.460
Established it in Taiwan

45:02.460 --> 45:03.460
After two years

45:03.460 --> 45:05.460
Officially assigned to work

45:05.460 --> 45:06.460
As a result

45:06.460 --> 45:09.460
It didn't take long to establish

45:09.460 --> 45:10.460
Ten years later

45:10.460 --> 45:11.460
Nine years

45:11.460 --> 45:13.460
Then the Jiawu War happened

45:13.460 --> 45:16.460
On March 23, Japan

45:16.460 --> 45:17.460
One of the Penghu

45:17.460 --> 45:18.460
Japan has occupied Penghu

45:18.460 --> 45:21.460
So in the so-called Jiawu War

45:21.460 --> 45:23.460
Penghu is actually

45:23.460 --> 45:25.460
Involved in the war

45:25.460 --> 45:26.460
But Japan

45:26.460 --> 45:28.460
He has an army to occupy Penghu

45:28.460 --> 45:30.460
Here I want to mention

45:30.460 --> 45:31.460
In the past

45:31.460 --> 45:33.460
Just before

45:33.460 --> 45:35.460
Before World War I and World War II

45:35.460 --> 45:36.460
In the International Law

45:36.460 --> 45:38.460
Basically during the war

45:38.460 --> 45:41.460
If you are in the war

45:41.460 --> 45:42.460
This one

45:42.460 --> 45:44.460
For example, the enemy occupied

45:44.460 --> 45:46.460
His opponent's country

45:46.460 --> 45:48.460
A piece of territory

45:48.460 --> 45:50.460
When there is an occupation

45:50.460 --> 45:52.460
Usually after the war

45:52.460 --> 45:54.460
The part that was occupied

45:54.460 --> 45:56.460
May be cut off

45:56.460 --> 45:57.460
So in fact, Japan

45:57.460 --> 45:59.460
On March 23, he occupied Penghu

45:59.460 --> 46:01.460
Is meaningful

46:02.460 --> 46:03.460
That is to say

46:03.460 --> 46:05.460
Japan wants to say

46:05.460 --> 46:07.460
He wants to eat Taiwan and Penghu

46:07.460 --> 46:09.460
So anyway

46:09.460 --> 46:10.460
On March 23

46:10.460 --> 46:11.460
He sent the army first

46:11.460 --> 46:13.460
To occupy Penghu

46:13.460 --> 46:15.460
Later, when signing the contract

46:15.460 --> 46:16.460
There is a big bargaining chip

46:16.460 --> 46:21.460
Can ask the Qing Empire to give up Penghu

46:21.460 --> 46:22.460
Here we can take a look

46:22.460 --> 46:24.460
That is to say

46:24.460 --> 46:26.460
The Qing Empire was in 1772

46:26.460 --> 46:27.460
The scope he controlled

46:27.460 --> 46:28.460
It's actually very small

46:28.460 --> 46:30.460
In other words

46:30.460 --> 46:31.460
After the Qing Empire

46:31.460 --> 46:33.460
After he solved the Kingdom of Dongning

46:33.460 --> 46:34.460
In 1772

46:34.460 --> 46:36.460
The scope he actually controlled

46:36.460 --> 46:37.460
It's still very small

46:37.460 --> 46:39.460
Still limited to the original

46:39.460 --> 46:41.460
The scope controlled by the Kingdom of Dongning

46:41.460 --> 46:43.460
By 1884

46:51.460 --> 46:52.460
Then in 1884

46:56.460 --> 46:58.460
Then in 1884

46:59.460 --> 47:00.460
The Qing Empire

47:00.460 --> 47:02.460
The scope of control is relatively large

47:02.460 --> 47:04.460
Just now

47:04.460 --> 47:05.460
Does anyone want to speak?

47:05.460 --> 47:06.460
Just now

47:08.460 --> 47:09.460
It's okay, you can continue

47:09.460 --> 47:10.460
I'm sorry

47:10.460 --> 47:11.460
OK

47:11.460 --> 47:13.460
In 1772

47:13.460 --> 47:14.460
The Qing Empire

47:14.460 --> 47:16.460
The scope of control on the island of Taiwan

47:16.460 --> 47:18.460
Is very small

47:18.460 --> 47:20.460
Then in 1884

47:20.460 --> 47:22.460
His scope of control is relatively large

47:22.460 --> 47:23.460
But we found

47:23.460 --> 47:25.460
In the middle of the island of Taiwan

47:25.460 --> 47:27.460
Is mainly the mountainous area

47:27.460 --> 47:28.460
The Qing Empire

47:28.460 --> 47:30.460
Basically uncontrollable

47:30.460 --> 47:32.460
But actually we see

47:32.460 --> 47:33.460
This 1884

47:33.460 --> 47:34.460
The Qing Empire

47:34.460 --> 47:36.460
The scope he controlled

47:36.460 --> 47:38.460
Actually in the eastern part

47:38.460 --> 47:39.460
For example, in the so-called

47:39.460 --> 47:42.460
The part of Beinanting

47:42.460 --> 47:45.460
May be a little bragging

47:45.460 --> 47:47.460
Because actually

47:47.460 --> 47:48.460
The Qing Empire

47:48.460 --> 47:50.460
In the middle of the east

47:50.460 --> 47:51.460
His ability to control

47:51.460 --> 47:54.460
Not so strong

47:54.460 --> 47:56.460
Then in 1895

47:56.460 --> 47:57.460
This

47:57.460 --> 47:58.460
The Treaty of Maguan

47:58.460 --> 48:00.460
The Treaty of Maguan was signed on May 8th

48:00.460 --> 48:02.460
Then the Great Japanese

48:02.460 --> 48:03.460
In terms of international law

48:03.460 --> 48:04.460
The Great Japanese Empire is

48:04.460 --> 48:06.460
According to this Treaty of Maguan

48:06.460 --> 48:07.460
To obtain the Qing Empire

48:07.460 --> 48:09.460
The rule of law in the Taiwan Strait

48:11.460 --> 48:12.460
Then

48:12.460 --> 48:14.460
After a few weeks

48:14.460 --> 48:15.460
I said it was not really

48:15.460 --> 48:17.460
To establish an independent democratic country

48:19.460 --> 48:20.460
Then this is also particularly emphasized

48:20.460 --> 48:22.460
It's not really independent

48:22.460 --> 48:23.460
Why do you say that?

48:23.460 --> 48:24.460
Because

48:24.460 --> 48:26.460
In fact, Taiwan is a democratic country

48:26.460 --> 48:29.460
Some people see Taiwan as a democratic country today

48:29.460 --> 48:31.460
I think this is the Taiwanese claim

48:31.460 --> 48:32.460
Independent

48:32.460 --> 48:35.460
Is a pioneer

48:35.460 --> 48:36.460
Then there is also the belief that

48:36.460 --> 48:38.460
Is now going to restore the country

48:38.460 --> 48:40.460
What is the restoration of Taiwan's democracy?

48:40.460 --> 48:42.460
But the Taiwan Democratic Republic is actually

48:42.460 --> 48:45.460
When it was established

48:45.460 --> 48:47.460
In fact, it's just a delay

48:47.460 --> 48:49.460
That's just to say

48:49.460 --> 48:51.460
Some officials of the Qing Empire

48:51.460 --> 48:52.460
Then there were some

48:52.460 --> 48:53.460
Some scholars at the time wanted to say

48:53.460 --> 48:54.460
They want to say

48:54.460 --> 48:55.460
Announce independence as soon as possible

48:55.460 --> 48:56.460
Then

48:56.460 --> 48:59.460
See if there are other countries to intervene

48:59.460 --> 49:01.460
Then let Japan

49:01.460 --> 49:02.460
There is no way to put that

49:02.460 --> 49:03.460
Taiwan and Penghu

49:03.460 --> 49:04.460
Become its territory

49:04.460 --> 49:06.460
Because we know that in the Treaty of Maguan

49:06.460 --> 49:10.460
The original part of the Great Japanese Empire

49:10.460 --> 49:11.460
Except for Penghu, Taiwan

49:11.460 --> 49:12.460
Including those places on the Liaodong Peninsula

49:12.460 --> 49:13.460
As a result

49:13.460 --> 49:16.460
There is the so-called Three Kingdoms Intervention in Liao

49:16.460 --> 49:18.460
So actually at that time

49:18.460 --> 49:19.460
Some officials in Taiwan

49:19.460 --> 49:20.460
There are some scholars

49:20.460 --> 49:21.460
They are thinking

49:21.460 --> 49:22.460
I will announce independence as soon as possible today

49:22.460 --> 49:24.460
Then maybe other countries will intervene

49:24.460 --> 49:25.460
Then Japan will put Taiwan and Penghu

49:25.460 --> 49:27.460
Into the Qing Empire

49:27.460 --> 49:28.460
So there is such an idea

49:28.460 --> 49:30.460
So even the Taiwan Democratic Republic

49:30.460 --> 49:31.460
Even that year

49:31.460 --> 49:33.460
Its year is called Yongqing

49:33.460 --> 49:34.460
You know that this is

49:34.460 --> 49:37.460
Always loyal to the Qing Empire

49:37.460 --> 49:39.460
So in fact, the Taiwan Democratic Republic

49:39.460 --> 49:40.460
It's really not

49:40.460 --> 49:42.460
It really means independence

49:42.460 --> 49:45.460
So in terms of international law

49:45.460 --> 49:48.460
After the establishment of the Taiwan Democratic Republic

49:48.460 --> 49:49.460
Basically speaking

49:49.460 --> 49:50.460
There is no country to admit

49:50.460 --> 49:52.460
No other country

49:52.460 --> 49:55.460
Admit the existence of this country

49:55.460 --> 49:56.460
Everyone can see it clearly

49:56.460 --> 49:58.460
No one wants to

49:58.460 --> 50:00.460
Take advantage of this

50:00.460 --> 50:02.460
So in terms of concept

50:02.460 --> 50:03.460
Taiwan Democratic Republic

50:03.460 --> 50:05.460
Is on the mainland territory of the Great Japanese Empire

50:05.460 --> 50:08.460
Taiwan's rebellion

50:08.460 --> 50:10.460
The so-called Taiwan Democratic Republic was established by the rebellion

50:10.460 --> 50:13.460
That's about five months later

50:13.460 --> 50:15.460
This is the end of the military suppression

50:15.460 --> 50:20.460
So the Taiwan Democratic Republic was destroyed

50:20.460 --> 50:21.460
And then this

50:21.460 --> 50:22.460
By 1910

50:22.460 --> 50:24.460
The Great Japanese Empire began to use force

50:24.460 --> 50:28.460
To annex the territory of the aborigines

50:28.460 --> 50:29.460
Then I say here

50:29.460 --> 50:32.460
Use force to annex the territory of the aborigines

50:32.460 --> 50:33.460
Then in this place

50:33.460 --> 50:36.460
It's a way to conquer with force

50:36.460 --> 50:39.460
Before World War I

50:39.460 --> 50:42.460
Is to conquer with force

50:42.460 --> 50:43.460
Is to wage war

50:43.460 --> 50:46.460
Use force to conquer the territory of others

50:46.460 --> 50:48.460
Then expand your own sovereignty

50:48.460 --> 50:49.460
Territory

50:49.460 --> 50:50.460
In international law

50:50.460 --> 50:52.460
Is legal

50:52.460 --> 50:53.460
Before this

50:53.460 --> 50:54.460
Before World War I

50:54.460 --> 50:56.460
This is legal

50:56.460 --> 50:58.460
But after World War I

50:58.460 --> 50:59.460
Such behavior

50:59.460 --> 51:00.460
Basically speaking

51:00.460 --> 51:02.460
It is deemed illegal

51:02.460 --> 51:04.460
That is because

51:04.460 --> 51:05.460
To avoid the country

51:05.460 --> 51:08.460
Expand the territory by force

51:08.460 --> 51:09.460
Anyway

51:09.460 --> 51:10.460
Is Japan

51:10.460 --> 51:11.460
The Great Japanese Empire

51:11.460 --> 51:12.460
He is using force

51:12.460 --> 51:13.460
To conquer

51:13.460 --> 51:15.460
Can legally expand the territory

51:15.460 --> 51:16.460
During the period

51:16.460 --> 51:17.460
He used force

51:17.460 --> 51:19.460
To annex the territory of the aborigines

51:19.460 --> 51:22.460
Then he used this

51:22.460 --> 51:24.460
The so-called Five-Year Li Fan Plan

51:24.460 --> 51:26.460
Is to use force to conquer

51:26.460 --> 51:29.460
By January 15, 1915

51:29.460 --> 51:31.460
The Five-Year Li Fan Plan was completed

51:31.460 --> 51:33.460
It was announced to end on the 20th of the same month

51:33.460 --> 51:35.460
This is the so-called Taiwan Islands

51:35.460 --> 51:36.460
Out of the city

51:36.460 --> 51:37.460
That is to say

51:37.460 --> 51:39.460
On this day

51:39.460 --> 51:41.460
Taiwan Islands

51:41.460 --> 51:43.460
Every inch of land

51:43.460 --> 51:45.460
Is his true sovereignty

51:45.460 --> 51:49.460
Belongs to the Great Japanese Empire

51:49.460 --> 51:50.460
So we know

51:50.460 --> 51:52.460
Actually this

51:52.460 --> 51:53.460
Taiwan Islands

51:53.460 --> 51:54.460
The Great Empire

51:54.460 --> 51:56.460
He gave it to Japan

51:56.460 --> 51:57.460
In fact, it does not include the so-called

51:57.460 --> 51:58.460
Central Mountain Area

51:58.460 --> 52:00.460
Then there is the eastern part

52:00.460 --> 52:01.460
That is Japan

52:01.460 --> 52:02.460
After he used force to conquer

52:02.460 --> 52:04.460
He really got a complete

52:04.460 --> 52:05.460
Taiwan Islands

52:05.460 --> 52:08.460
Conquered sovereignty

52:08.460 --> 52:09.460
In 1943

52:09.460 --> 52:10.460
This

52:10.460 --> 52:11.460
Later

52:11.460 --> 52:12.460
After the island returned to Japan

52:12.460 --> 52:14.460
It's been a while

52:14.460 --> 52:15.460
Then this

52:15.460 --> 52:17.460
The Second World War broke out

52:17.460 --> 52:18.460
That

52:18.460 --> 52:20.460
On October 23, 1943

52:20.460 --> 52:21.460
The so-called Kairo Airstrike

52:21.460 --> 52:22.460
Then it says

52:22.460 --> 52:24.460
The Taiwan-Japan War will return to the Republic of China

52:24.460 --> 52:27.460
Then on July 26, 1945

52:27.460 --> 52:28.460
The Wade Declaration

52:28.460 --> 52:29.460
Then it says that the Kairo Declaration

52:29.460 --> 52:31.460
Must be implemented

52:31.460 --> 52:33.460
August 15, 1945

52:33.460 --> 52:34.460
The Great Japanese Empire

52:34.460 --> 52:35.460
This

52:35.460 --> 52:37.460
The emperor of the Japanese

52:37.460 --> 52:39.460
The Great Japanese Empire unconditionally surrendered to the Mongols

52:39.460 --> 52:40.460
I think

52:40.460 --> 52:41.460
Ok

52:41.460 --> 52:42.460
Then let's jump back and see

52:42.460 --> 52:43.460
This 1895

52:43.460 --> 52:44.460
I just said before

52:44.460 --> 52:45.460
I said that the Qing Empire

52:45.460 --> 52:46.460
He

52:46.460 --> 52:47.460
In that

52:47.460 --> 52:48.460
The 1884

52:48.460 --> 52:49.460
That one

52:49.460 --> 52:51.460
He said he was on the east side

52:51.460 --> 52:53.460
The part of the Northern Land

52:53.460 --> 52:54.460
Say that part is a bit bragging

52:54.460 --> 52:55.460
why

52:55.460 --> 52:56.460
You see, in 1895

52:56.460 --> 52:57.460
When the Great Japanese Empire

52:57.460 --> 52:58.460
The range it can control

52:58.460 --> 53:00.460
Not including the east

53:00.460 --> 53:04.460
That is actually very interesting

53:04.460 --> 53:05.460
That is to say

53:05.460 --> 53:06.460
Because this place actually represents

53:06.460 --> 53:07.460
That is to say

53:07.460 --> 53:09.460
Originally these places were all

53:09.460 --> 53:11.460
The Great Japanese Empire can effectively control

53:11.460 --> 53:12.460
Should be able to

53:12.460 --> 53:14.460
Effectively transfer to Japan

53:14.460 --> 53:16.460
But actually for Japan

53:16.460 --> 53:18.460
He said in 1895

53:18.460 --> 53:19.460
He is on the east side

53:19.460 --> 53:20.460
He still can't control

53:20.460 --> 53:22.460
That place is the aboriginal place

53:22.460 --> 53:23.460
But in 1920

53:23.460 --> 53:25.460
Found the island of Taiwan

53:25.460 --> 53:28.460
All included in the Great Japanese Empire

53:28.460 --> 53:30.460
Set up this administrative plan

53:30.460 --> 53:32.460
Japan also effectively governs

53:32.460 --> 53:33.460
So we know that

53:33.460 --> 53:35.460
In fact, the sovereignty of the entire island of Taiwan

53:35.460 --> 53:36.460
In fact, the Great Japanese Empire

53:36.460 --> 53:38.460
Is the first one

53:38.460 --> 53:42.460
A country with sovereignty over the island of Taiwan

53:42.460 --> 53:43.460
OK

53:43.460 --> 53:46.460
I just talked about this in 1895

53:46.460 --> 53:47.460
1945

53:47.460 --> 53:48.460
August 15, 1945

53:48.460 --> 53:49.460
This

53:49.460 --> 53:51.460
The emperor of the Great Japanese Empire

53:51.460 --> 53:54.460
Is to announce the surrender of the Five Straits

53:54.460 --> 53:55.460
Then on September 2

53:55.460 --> 53:56.460
The Great Japanese Empire

53:56.460 --> 53:58.460
He signed the surrender document

53:58.460 --> 53:59.460
The surrender document

53:59.460 --> 54:01.460
It is a ceasefire agreement

54:01.460 --> 54:02.460
That is to say

54:02.460 --> 54:03.460
After signing this

54:03.460 --> 54:07.460
Everyone will fire each other

54:07.460 --> 54:10.460
So this is just a ceasefire agreement

54:10.460 --> 54:14.460
The purpose is to end the battle

54:14.460 --> 54:15.460
Then the same day

54:15.460 --> 54:17.460
The same day

54:17.460 --> 54:18.460
Chief of the Allied Forces

54:18.460 --> 54:19.460
Commander Michael Arthur

54:19.460 --> 54:20.460
He ordered the Great Japanese Empire

54:20.460 --> 54:21.460
Issued what he issued

54:21.460 --> 54:23.460
General Order No. 1

54:23.460 --> 54:24.460
General Order No. 1

54:24.460 --> 54:25.460
Inside

54:25.460 --> 54:26.460
He agreed that

54:26.460 --> 54:28.460
The representative of the regime of the Republic of China

54:28.460 --> 54:29.460
According to the arrangements in the order

54:29.460 --> 54:30.460
In China

54:30.460 --> 54:32.460
Not including Manchuria

54:32.460 --> 54:33.460
In China

54:33.460 --> 54:34.460
Then in Taipeng

54:34.460 --> 54:36.460
Then 16 degrees north to north

54:36.460 --> 54:37.460
French Indochina

54:37.460 --> 54:41.460
Accept Japanese surrender

54:41.460 --> 54:42.460
Then

54:42.460 --> 54:43.460
Let's take a look

54:43.460 --> 54:45.460
Someone just said in China

54:45.460 --> 54:46.460
Then Taipeng

54:46.460 --> 54:47.460
Then 16 degrees north to north

54:47.460 --> 54:48.460
So I found out

54:48.460 --> 54:50.460
He is a division list

54:50.460 --> 54:51.460
So it means

54:51.460 --> 54:53.460
Taipeng is not part of China

54:53.460 --> 54:54.460
Then China

54:54.460 --> 54:55.460
It does not include Manchuria

54:55.460 --> 54:56.460
Then why is it planned like this

54:56.460 --> 54:57.460
Because at that time Manchuria

54:57.460 --> 54:59.460
Is handed over to the Soviet Union

54:59.460 --> 55:01.460
To be responsible

55:01.460 --> 55:02.460
Then go to surrender

55:02.460 --> 55:04.460
Then occupy

55:04.460 --> 55:06.460
Then October 25, 1945

55:06.460 --> 55:07.460
This is Chiang Kai-shek

55:07.460 --> 55:08.460
He sent the representative of the surrender

55:08.460 --> 55:09.460
Chen Yi

55:09.460 --> 55:10.460
To the Taipei Public Security Hall

55:10.460 --> 55:12.460
Hold the Allied Surrender Ceremony

55:12.460 --> 55:14.460
But he held this

55:14.460 --> 55:15.460
When the surrender ceremony

55:15.460 --> 55:17.460
He did not say that this is

55:17.460 --> 55:19.460
The Allied Forces came to surrender

55:19.460 --> 55:20.460
He said this is called

55:20.460 --> 55:22.460
Taiwan restoration

55:22.460 --> 55:23.460
That

55:23.460 --> 55:24.460
At that time he

55:24.460 --> 55:26.460
The Republic of China regime

55:26.460 --> 55:27.460
Here in Taiwan

55:27.460 --> 55:28.460
Established a

55:28.460 --> 55:29.460
Occupation agency

55:29.460 --> 55:30.460
It's called

55:30.460 --> 55:32.460
Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency

55:32.460 --> 55:34.460
Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency

55:34.460 --> 55:36.460
Add the three words of Taiwan Provincial

55:36.460 --> 55:38.460
That because

55:38.460 --> 55:39.460
Actually this

55:39.460 --> 55:40.460
At this time

55:40.460 --> 55:42.460
Taiwan is just

55:42.460 --> 55:43.460
Allied Forces

55:43.460 --> 55:44.460
Military occupation

55:44.460 --> 55:45.460
That is to say, it is not really

55:45.460 --> 55:47.460
Return to the Republic of China

55:47.460 --> 55:48.460
The sovereignty did not really

55:48.460 --> 55:50.460
Return to the Republic of China

55:50.460 --> 55:51.460
That

55:51.460 --> 55:53.460
Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency

55:53.460 --> 55:55.460
In fact, it represents the Allied Forces

55:55.460 --> 55:56.460
To Taiwan and Penghu

55:56.460 --> 55:58.460
Occupation

55:58.460 --> 55:59.460
But because

55:59.460 --> 56:00.460
The Republic of China is thinking

56:00.460 --> 56:01.460
Anyway, that

56:01.460 --> 56:02.460
The Cairo Times said that

56:02.460 --> 56:03.460
Taiwan and Penghu

56:03.460 --> 56:04.460
After Japan surrendered

56:04.460 --> 56:06.460
Will return to the Republic of China

56:06.460 --> 56:07.460
So he just

56:07.460 --> 56:08.460
A little bit like

56:08.460 --> 56:09.460
Before and after

56:09.460 --> 56:10.460
A little bit like

56:10.460 --> 56:11.460
Five tickets after getting on the bus

56:11.460 --> 56:13.460
So he just

56:13.460 --> 56:14.460
Established the so-called

56:14.460 --> 56:15.460
Administrative Officer Agency

56:15.460 --> 56:16.460
Then add Taiwan Provincial in front

56:16.460 --> 56:17.460
That goes with that

56:17.460 --> 56:18.460
Taiwan Guangfu

56:18.460 --> 56:21.460
That

56:21.460 --> 56:23.460
January 12, 1946

56:23.460 --> 56:24.460
The Republic of China regime

56:24.460 --> 56:25.460
He issued

56:25.460 --> 56:26.460
Administrative order

56:26.460 --> 56:27.460
Then restore Taiwan Penghu

56:27.460 --> 56:28.460
Well-known

56:28.460 --> 56:30.460
Republic of China nationality

56:30.460 --> 56:31.460
That

56:31.460 --> 56:32.460
Britain and the United States

56:32.460 --> 56:33.460
In this place

56:33.460 --> 56:34.460
He protested

56:34.460 --> 56:35.460
He said because of Taiwan Penghu sovereignty

56:35.460 --> 56:36.460
At this time

56:36.460 --> 56:37.460
Still belong to Japan

56:37.460 --> 56:38.460
So you have to say

56:38.460 --> 56:39.460
Britain and the United States are clear

56:39.460 --> 56:40.460
He said there was no Taiwan Guangfu

56:40.460 --> 56:41.460
This kind of thing

56:41.460 --> 56:42.460
No 18

56:42.460 --> 56:43.460
December 15, 1945

56:43.460 --> 56:44.460
No Taiwan Guangfu

56:44.460 --> 56:45.460
This kind of thing

56:45.460 --> 56:46.460
Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

56:46.460 --> 56:47.460
In 1942

56:47.460 --> 56:48.460
Still belong to Japan

56:48.460 --> 56:49.460
So they said

56:49.460 --> 56:51.460
You can't be in the Republic of China

56:51.460 --> 56:52.460
Just like this

56:52.460 --> 56:53.460
Directly to the occupation

56:53.460 --> 56:55.460
People's nationality

56:55.460 --> 56:56.460
But the Republic of China

56:56.460 --> 56:59.460
He continues

56:59.460 --> 57:00.460
I do what I do

57:00.460 --> 57:01.460
So anyway

57:01.460 --> 57:02.460
He still does

57:02.460 --> 57:03.460
But in international law

57:03.460 --> 57:04.460
In fact, at that time

57:04.460 --> 57:05.460
Taiwanese people

57:05.460 --> 57:07.460
Taiwan and Penghu

57:07.460 --> 57:09.460
Residents

57:09.460 --> 57:10.460
They

57:10.460 --> 57:11.460
In international law

57:11.460 --> 57:12.460
He still has

57:12.460 --> 57:13.460
Still have

57:13.460 --> 57:14.460
Great Japanese Empire

57:14.460 --> 57:18.460
Is the nationality of Japan

57:18.460 --> 57:19.460
But at this time

57:19.460 --> 57:20.460
They have one more

57:20.460 --> 57:22.460
The so-called Republic of China nationality

57:22.460 --> 57:23.460
So at that time

57:23.460 --> 57:24.460
Taipeng resident

57:24.460 --> 57:26.460
Double nationality

57:26.460 --> 57:29.460
Everyone has two nationalities

57:29.460 --> 57:30.460
Then

57:30.460 --> 57:32.460
On February 28, 1947

57:32.460 --> 57:33.460
Then

57:33.460 --> 57:35.460
Then all the way to the same April

57:35.460 --> 57:37.460
On February 28, the Great Lusha

57:37.460 --> 57:39.460
This thing

57:39.460 --> 57:41.460
In fact, here we can know

57:41.460 --> 57:43.460
Say

57:43.460 --> 57:44.460
In fact, here

57:44.460 --> 57:46.460
What happened

57:46.460 --> 57:47.460
It's definitely not the government

57:47.460 --> 57:49.460
With his name

57:49.460 --> 57:50.460
Is a national government

57:50.460 --> 57:52.460
With his people

57:52.460 --> 57:53.460
Conflict

57:53.460 --> 57:55.460
It's not the case

57:55.460 --> 57:57.460
The situation here is

57:57.460 --> 57:58.460
A

57:58.460 --> 58:00.460
Occupation

58:00.460 --> 58:01.460
In

58:01.460 --> 58:02.460
Occupation of the victorious country

58:02.460 --> 58:04.460
On the territory of the defeated country

58:04.460 --> 58:06.460
The act of slaughtering the people of the defeated country

58:06.460 --> 58:08.460
This is definitely not what

58:08.460 --> 58:10.460
It's not an official-civilian conflict

58:10.460 --> 58:11.460
It's not an official-civilian conflict

58:11.460 --> 58:12.460
This is

58:12.460 --> 58:14.460
Cross-national slaughter

58:17.460 --> 58:19.460
Because after the February 28 incident

58:19.460 --> 58:21.460
This

58:21.460 --> 58:22.460
The people of Taiwan are of course

58:22.460 --> 58:24.460
For this

58:24.460 --> 58:25.460
The regime of the Republic of China

58:25.460 --> 58:26.460
Very dissatisfied with the situation here in Taiwan

58:26.460 --> 58:27.460
Then they also made a request

58:27.460 --> 58:30.460
Request that the governor-general of Taiwan province

58:30.460 --> 58:31.460
Require him to be re-elected

58:31.460 --> 58:33.460
Become the provincial government of Taiwan

58:33.460 --> 58:35.460
Because he thinks

58:35.460 --> 58:37.460
Chen Yi is like another

58:37.460 --> 58:39.460
Like the Governor-General of Taiwan

58:39.460 --> 58:40.460
That

58:40.460 --> 58:41.460
The regime of the Republic of China

58:41.460 --> 58:42.460
Later on April 22

58:42.460 --> 58:45.460
When it was

58:45.460 --> 58:47.460
Re-elected the provincial government of Taiwan

58:47.460 --> 58:48.460
That

58:48.460 --> 58:49.460
On May 17, the provincial government of Taiwan

58:49.460 --> 58:51.460
Officially operated

58:51.460 --> 58:52.460
Then in front of this

58:52.460 --> 58:56.460
I want to talk about it

58:56.460 --> 58:58.460
Re-elect the governor-general of Taiwan province

58:58.460 --> 58:59.460
Re-elected

58:59.460 --> 59:00.460
Re-elected the provincial government of Taiwan

59:00.460 --> 59:02.460
This is actually

59:02.460 --> 59:04.460
The requirements that the people of Taiwan put forth

59:04.460 --> 59:06.460
This is the requirements that the people of Taiwan put forth

59:06.460 --> 59:07.460
It means that the people of Taiwan

59:07.460 --> 59:08.460
At that time

59:08.460 --> 59:10.460
They think they are

59:10.460 --> 59:12.460
Citizens of the Republic of China

59:12.460 --> 59:13.460
And don't think they are

59:13.460 --> 59:16.460
People occupying the land

59:16.460 --> 59:18.460
So they will make such a request

59:18.460 --> 59:19.460
So to some extent

59:19.460 --> 59:20.460
It means that I am Chinese

59:20.460 --> 59:22.460
So

59:22.460 --> 59:25.460
So this is actually a choice

59:25.460 --> 59:26.460
This is a choice

59:26.460 --> 59:28.460
The result of this choice

59:28.460 --> 59:30.460
Caused a big problem

59:30.460 --> 59:31.460
OK

59:31.460 --> 59:32.460
On May 17, 1947

59:32.460 --> 59:34.460
The provincial government of Taiwan officially operated

59:34.460 --> 59:37.460
On October 1, 1949

59:37.460 --> 59:39.460
The government of the People's Republic of China

59:39.460 --> 59:40.460
Witness

59:40.460 --> 59:42.460
I don't want to talk about witnessing

59:42.460 --> 59:43.460
Witness

59:43.460 --> 59:44.460
Because actually in this place

59:44.460 --> 59:45.460
What really happened

59:45.460 --> 59:47.460
Is not to establish another country

59:47.460 --> 59:51.460
But another government

59:51.460 --> 59:52.460
That also started on this day

59:52.460 --> 59:55.460
On October 1, 1949

59:55.460 --> 59:56.460
China

59:56.460 --> 59:58.460
There is a two-party regime

59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.460
There are two regimes under China

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460
Republic of China regime

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.460
With the People's Republic of China regime

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.460
These two regimes

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.460
Began to fight

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:09.460
Who is the representative government of China

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.460
That has been fighting to this day

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.460
Keep fighting to this day

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.460
Still fighting to this day

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.460
Some people may think

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:16.460
No

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.460
Now the government of the Republic of China

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.460
Isn't it the government of Taiwan?

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.460
Where is he fighting this thing?

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.460
In fact, there is

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.460
Why not

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.460
Because we look at this before

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.460
In 2017

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.460
Panama

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.460
He changed to recognize the People's Republic of China regime

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.460
Is the Chinese representative government

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.460
Of course, Taiwan is writing here

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.460
What is Taiwan-Panamanian diplomatic relations?

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.460
But we look at that time

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.460
Republic of China regime

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.460
What does his Ministry of Foreign Affairs say?

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.460
He said

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.460
Republic of China regime

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.460
Between Panama

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460
The diplomatic relations between the two countries

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.460
More than a century

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.460
How does this century count?

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.460
When did it start?

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.460
Counting from 1910

01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.460
This is very interesting

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:04.460
If the Republic of China regime is not China

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.460
How could you

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.460
If it's really Taiwan

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:09.460
How could you be with Panama

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.460
More than a century of diplomatic relations

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.460
Because in 1910

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.460
Taiwan is the territory of Japan

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.460
So it's impossible for Taiwan to establish diplomatic relations with Panama

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.460
So in 1910

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.460
It must be China

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.460
And the point is

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.460
In 1910

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.460
The Republic of China has not appeared yet

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.460
Still the Qing Empire

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.460
So we know

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.460
The Republic of China is the Qing Empire

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.460
So he just counted like this

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.460
Then the Republic of China is China

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.460
So from here we can know

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.460
The Republic of China regime says itself is Taiwan

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.460
This is actually a big question mark

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.460
Republic of China government

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.460
Until now

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.460
It's still so determined

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.460
It's still so determined

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:48.460
In fact, the Republic of China regime

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.460
It's all like this

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.460
Look at him

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.460
It's all like this

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.460
There is no diplomatic country

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.460
China

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.460
This thing

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.460
Take it from him

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.460
There is still China

01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.460
Where is this attribute

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.460
OK

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:01.460
it is good

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.460
On December 8, 1949

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.460
Because of this

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.460
Domestic relations

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.460
Do you have any questions?

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.460
No no

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.460
I don't have a question

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.460
Let's pause here for a moment

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.460
Just to this

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:19.460
Before the establishment of the People's Republic of China

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.460
Because there are a lot of historical facts here

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.460
quite a lot

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.460
Let's stop here

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.460
Before the establishment of the People's Republic of China

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.460
Does anyone have any questions?

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.460
Do you want to ask?

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.460
I can ask

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.460
You say

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.460
I just

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.460
I am a historian

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.460
Then I also read some

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.460
Some questions about international law

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.460
Then of course

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.460
I haven't talked about the key part yet

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:50.460
Is the 1952 Sanhok Agreement

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.460
I look forward to how you will interpret that thing

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.460
But I think so far

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.460
I heard a question

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.460
Is that when you first defined the international law

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.460
There are three

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:02.460
It was just mentioned by Yan Yong

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.460
Then you put Taiwan in the third

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.460
He is just a full-time independent unit

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.460
Instead of a country

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.460
If your definition is like that

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.460
In fact, you are still discussing

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.460
That is to say

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.460
You try to put the regime of the Republic of China

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.460
Kick out of Taiwan

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.460
Then think that the people of Taiwan can decide for themselves

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.460
The government of the Republic of China is just one of the exiled regimes

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.460
That is unreasonable

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.460
Because of your own

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.460
Your own

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.460
The original assumption is that Taiwan is not a country

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.460
If your original assumption is like that

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.460
That is to say

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.460
Taiwan can't get out of the Republic of the People's Republic of China

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:38.460
Can't skip the Republic of the People's Republic of China

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.460
Then talk to yourself

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.460
I can be independent

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.460
What can I do about this

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.460
Do you understand

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.460
Do you understand the mistake

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.460
Ah, I think you

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.460
This inference seems a bit strange

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.460
Because why would you go to the Republic of China

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.460
There is no way to escape

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.460
It has nothing to do with him

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I just heard it

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.460
The feeling is the first one

01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.460
The first step is to say

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.460
I want to make sure that we are on the same page

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.460
You think Taiwan's current situation is not a sovereign state

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.460
Right

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.460
That's because it's all the way down

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.460
The result is that Taiwan is not a country

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.460
So I will

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.460
That is

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.460
I just said earlier

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.460
Why is Taiwan not a country

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:18.460
I said I would talk about it later

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.460
Oh, so

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.460
It's not that I make an assumption first

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.460
No, no

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.460
Is that I push it all the way

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.460
Because in the end it will be made

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.460
I will tell you that the whole way

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.460
There will be a conclusion

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.460
And the conclusion is

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460
Taiwan is not a country

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.460
But Taiwan is really a

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.460
A place of independent operation

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.460
So I put this thing on

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.460
That is to say, this is

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460
A political entity mentioned in the International Law

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.460
Something that will appear

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.460
Because Taiwan is really a political entity

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.460
Participating in international society

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.460
It doesn't matter if you continue

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.460
Because of that 1952

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.460
The San Francisco Treaty

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.460
I think it's more critical

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.460
I think

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.460
How to explain that

01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.460
Because I think it's quite interesting

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.460
Because I'm talking about this here

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.460
The point is

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.460
Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to who

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.460
Because Taiwan's sovereignty

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.460
Our sovereignty

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.460
Because it says here

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.460
Here

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:11.460
Taiwan's sovereignty is not yet

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.460
Belong to any

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.460
Still in Japan

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.460
Still in Japan

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.460
Actually, I think this question is good

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.460
But that's why

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.460
The reason I stopped here

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.460
This is what I will talk about later

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.460
So before this

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.460
About any historical events

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.460
Do you have any questions?

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.460
Because what Kiki said

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.460
With the next thing to talk about

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.460
Because that will be answered later

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.460
That will be answered later

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.460
I'm sorry

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.460
The part where someone left a message

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.460
Let me read it for him

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.460
I want to ask

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.460
Why is the Kinmen Mazu not in

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.460
In your definition of Taiwan

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.460
This will be talked about later

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.460
Will be talked about later, right?

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.460
But actually I will say

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.460
A simple truth

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.460
That is

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.460
Because the Kinmen Mazu

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.460
Never been

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.460
Conceded by China

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.460
The Kinmen Mazu has always been in China

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.460
So its historical direction

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:11.460
It's different from Taiwan

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.460
From 1895

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.460
There is a big difference

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.460
Yes, it was in 1895

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.460
Taiwan and Penghu were conceded to Japan

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:20.460
So these two places

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.460
After the defeat of Japan

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.460
The problem of transfer

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.460
It's different from the Kinmen Mazu

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.460
Because the Kinmen Mazu

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:30.460
It is inherited by the Manchurian government

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.460
The Republic of China government

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.460
Then the Republic of China government

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.460
Later became an exile government

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:36.460
So come to Taiwan

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.460
The Kinmen Mazu

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.460
Its sovereignty has always been

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.460
Belongs to the Republic of China government

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.460
But Taiwan

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.460
Because in 1895

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.460
There was a regime transfer

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.460
Is to transfer to Japan

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.460
Then after the defeat of Japan

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.460
Gave up this land

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.460
So Taiwan and Penghu will have problems

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.460
Kinmen Mazu has no problem

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.460
You secretly finished my thing

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.460
Do you want to come and talk

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.460
But anyway

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.460
But I think this place should be a little bit

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.460
Because I'll talk about it later

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.460
Because it's not actually

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.460
Sovereignty does not belong to the Republic of China

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.460
But belongs to China

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.460
Let's put it this way

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.460
Because when

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.460
We are talking about this part of sovereignty

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.460
Sovereignty belongs to

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.460
It must be a country

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.460
The Republic of China

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.460
It's actually in

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.460
People's Republic of China

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.460
Sovereignty appears

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.460
A state of two regimes under China

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.460
When

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.460
At this time

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.460
Actually the problem is

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.460
That is to say

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.460
That part of the territory

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.460
Anyway, the territory of China

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.460
Always the territory of China

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.460
But

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.460
Unless there is

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.460
Unless there are other changes

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:36.460
The status of the transfer of territorial sovereignty

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.460
But this

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.460
Republic of China regime

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.460
With the People's Republic of China regime

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:41.460
These two regimes

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.460
Who is the representative government of China

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.460
This is the problem

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.460
But Kinmen and Mazu

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:46.460
Always

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.460
Always belong to the territory of China

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.460
In other words

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.460
Republic of China

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460
It's not a

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.460
It's not a separate

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.460
People's Republic of China

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.460
country

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:56.460
They are a

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.460
Two regimes in a country

01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.460
Two

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.460
Who is the representative government of the government

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:02.460
regime

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.460
So it's always been like this

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.460
Always in this state

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:06.460
So

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.460
Kinmen has always been the territory of China

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.460
That's also because of this reason

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.460
So it becomes

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.460
Kinmen has always been tied to China

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.460
Taiwan and Penghu

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.460
There is a situation of leaving China

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.460
Now it's actually going to be discussed later

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.460
Taiwan and Penghu

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.460
Did you go back to China

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.460
Did you go back to

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.460
Become part of China's territory

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:28.460
This is actually

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.460
International law

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.460
Top

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.460
Issues to discuss

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.460
I think everyone is asking questions

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:34.460
It's almost time to break the meme

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.460
Otherwise, let's continue

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.460
Yes, let's continue

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.460
OK

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.460
it is good

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.460
That 1949

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.460
Then we know that this

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.460
Because of the international war

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:46.460
Then the Republic of China

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.460
The regime of the Republic of China

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.460
He passed the executive committee meeting

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.460
Decision

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.460
Then move the central government to

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.460
Taipeng

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:57.460
Become an exile regime

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.460
That actually

01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.460
The United States

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.460
These countries

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.460
A little bit

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.460
Forget it

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.460
That is to say

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:04.460
This one

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.460
It was announced

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.460
It was said that Taiwan and Penghu

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.460
Anyway, sooner or later

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.460
Return to China

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.460
right

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.460
that

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.460
I don't care about him

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.460
that

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.460
In case it is said that Taipeng

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.460
If it is said that in case

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.460
That

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.460
If the CCP eats it

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.460
You just admit it

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.460
But later because of the Korean War

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460
Just

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.460
American attitude

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.460
There are some

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.460
This

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.460
The attitude of the anti-communist country has changed

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.460
They think this

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:31.460
This communist country

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.460
They are now

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.460
To expand their power

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.460
That way

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:37.460
It's already

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.460
The country itself

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:39.460
Own

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.460
The uprising between the people

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.460
Or the form of revolution

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.460
In addition

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.460
There is also this

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.460
Is to use force to invade

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.460
So they think

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.460
This is unacceptable

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.460
So they think

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.460
No way

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.460
In this place

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.460
I think the communist country

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.460
Must be used

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.460
In a more powerful way

01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.460
To fight him

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.460
So at that time

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:01.460
They just

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.460
A conclusion

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:03.460
That is to say

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.460
Taiwan and Penghu can't fall

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.460
Communists

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.460
So at that time

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.460
They just

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.460
Maybe a

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.460
The so-called Taiwan Strait

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.460
Neutralization Declaration

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.460
At this time

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.460
He actually said

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.460
That is to say

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.460
Taiwan and Penghu

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.460
This part of the sovereignty

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.460
This question

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.460
This has not been decided yet

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.460
This has to be solved

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.460
Wait until

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.460
After signing a contract with Japan

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.460
Then decide

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.460
That's what they think

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.460
Or wait for the Korean War

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.460
After the end of the Korean War

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.460
Decide again

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.460
But later

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.460
Of course

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.460
There are some changes

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:38.460
That

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.460
On September 8, 1951

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.460
Japan and 48 allies

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:43.460
Members

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.460
Signed the San Francisco Treaty

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.460
At this time

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:49.460
When signing the San Francisco Treaty

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.460
China

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.460
There is no

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:53.460
Signed

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.460
Of course

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.460
A very important reason is because

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.460
In the end

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.460
China

01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.460
Which regime

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.460
To represent the government

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.460
To represent China

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.460
This

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.460
Allies

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.460
There is a dispute between the members

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:07.460
Like the United States

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.460
I feel like I have to ask the Republic of China to come

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.460
Like the Soviet Union

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.460
He felt like

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.460
There should be the People's Republic of China

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.460
regime

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.460
Everyone is arguing

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.460
Irreconcilable

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.460
So in the end

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.460
China is not

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.460
No

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.460
Signed the San Francisco Treaty

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.460
But in the San Francisco Treaty

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.460
There is a special

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.460
Part of China's power

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.460
There are some

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.460
Some

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.460
Conditions

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:31.460
In the second B of the San Francisco Treaty

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:32.460
He is clear

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.460
That is to say

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.460
Japan gives up the right to Taiwan Strait

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.460
Rights and demands

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.460
This is a complete

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.460
A way to give up the sovereignty of the Taiwan Strait

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:41.460
Ok

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:42.460
But he did not point out

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.460
Who is the owner of the sovereignty of the Taiwan Strait?

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.460
So this is in

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.460
The so-called status of Taiwan is not set

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.460
This legal basis

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.460
The basis of the International Law is completed

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:53.460
Before this

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.460
For example, on June 25, 1950

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.460
Taiwan's status is not set

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.460
This position comes out

01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.460
Actually

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.460
Because at that time

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.460
In fact, Taiwan and Penghu

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.460
Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to Japan

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:05.460
Just say

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.460
At that time

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.460
In fact, Truman meant

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.460
That is to say

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.460
Taiwan and Penghu

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.460
The status of the future

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.460
Not sure yet

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.460
That's just

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.460
This is in the San Francisco Treaty

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.460
Inside

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.460
In the second B

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.460
Directly put

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.460
The status of Taiwan and Penghu

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.460
Is not set

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.460
This legal basis

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.460
Set it up

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.460
So through this treaty

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.460
Inside this clause

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.460
Inside Japan

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.460
Then there is no designation

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.460
Who will accept

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.460
This one

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.460
Let Taiwan and Penghu

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.460
The final disposal

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.460
In a

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.460
Uncertain state

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.460
On the International Law

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.460
Taiwan and Penghu

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.460
The status is in an uncertain situation

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.460
In fact, in the San Francisco Treaty

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.460
It's not just Taiwan and Penghu

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.460
It's like this

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.460
There are others like

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.460
The West Shaanxi Islands

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.460
The South Shaanxi Islands

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:53.460
Then

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.460
And Japan

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.460
There were some at that time

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.460
There will be some

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.460
Tendao Islands

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.460
Kuye Islands

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.460
These places in the south

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.460
In fact, they are all in the same form

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.460
To standardize

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.460
So basically

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.460
All belong to the so-called status

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.460
To a certain state

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.460
Unless later

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:13.460
There are other special disposals

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.460
Taiwan and Penghu are not

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.460
OK

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.460
The second F below

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.460
I told you

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.460
He said to Mingding

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.460
The part of the South Shaanxi and the West Shaanxi

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:21.460
Japan is also in the same way

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.460
To give up

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.460
So this part is

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.460
Japan gave up

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.460
The sovereignty of these places

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:29.460
Absolutely give up

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.460
That was in 1951

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.460
On November 19

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.460
Japan's Yuren Emperor

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.460
According to the request of the Japanese Cabinet

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.460
To complete the certification of the San Francisco Treaty

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:38.460
Then I'm here

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.460
The reason for this particular point

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.460
Because

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.460
To some people

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.460
I'm still arguing now

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.460
That is to say

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.460
Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.460
Still belong to Japan

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:50.460
That

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.460
Their claim is

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.460
Because of that

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.460
The San Francisco Treaty

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.460
Is

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.460
Signed by the Japanese government

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.460
Not the Japanese emperor

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.460
Signed

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.460
So it doesn't count

01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460
Then I'm here

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.460
Special mention

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.460
That is to say

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.460
The Japanese emperor has already certified

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.460
San Francisco Treaty

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:04.460
So he has already recognized

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.460
So the San Francisco Treaty

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.460
To give up the Taiwan-Penghu sovereignty

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.460
The Japanese emperor has already recognized

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.460
So Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.460
No longer belong to Japan

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.460
That

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.460
In 1952

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:17.460
On April 19

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.460
Japanese Justice

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.460
Sorry

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.460
You say

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.460
Can I ask a question?

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.460
You say

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.460
You said here

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.460
Hey

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:28.460
San Francisco Treaty

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.460
China has no money

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.460
Then my question is

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.460
That way

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.460
Does this contract still count?

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:36.460
Or is this kind of contract

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.460
Is to

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.460
Big

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.460
I don't know how to

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.460
How does this contract work?

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.460
If there is one

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:44.460
From Mongolia

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.460
This contract is still valid

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.460
Thank you

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.460
OK

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.460
it is good

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.460
Let's talk about it now

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.460
San Francisco Treaty

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.460
San Francisco Treaty

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.460
It actually means this

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.460
because

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:56.460
The purpose of the contract

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:57.460
Is to end

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:01.460
The state of war between countries

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.460
So in San Francisco Treaty

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.460
Inside

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.460
Every signed country

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.460
Every signed member

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.460
Are the countries that have fought with Japan before

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.460
So San Francisco Treaty

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.460
Actually

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.460
Although it is Japan

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.460
Signed with so many countries

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:17.460
But actually

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.460
He

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.460
What I really want to say is

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.460
This

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.460
48 countries

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:26.460
Have signed a contract with Japan

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.460
That

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:28.460
The effect of this contract is

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:29.460
Happened in Japan

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.460
With

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:33.460
Between each signed country

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.460
Is the effect of individual establishment

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.460
Individual establishment effect

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.460
So

01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:39.460
It's the United Nations

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:40.460
Not a

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:41.460
It's not like a company

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:42.460
Something like a judge

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.460
It is a

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.460
Individual

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460
Gather

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460
So it's like

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.460
When we sign a contract

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.460
San Francisco Treaty

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.460
Effective in Japan

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.460
With

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.460
Every

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.460
Signed

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.460
Between countries

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460
That did not sign

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460
That's the contract

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.460
It doesn't work for that country

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.460
But it won't affect

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.460
Signed

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.460
The country with the contract

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.460
Efficiency between Japan

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:06.460
and so

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.460
In this place

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.460
San Francisco Treaty

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:09.460
Itself

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:10.460
When it works

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:11.460
Is

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.460
All countries that have signed and approved

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.460
This contract is effective

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.460
That

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:18.460
Not because

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.460
Which one

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.460
San Francisco members did not sign

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.460
Then the whole contract will be invalid

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.460
Or there is no way to work

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.460
because

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.460
The international law

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.460
Basically speaking

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.460
Between two countries

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:32.460
Established

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.460
one

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:36.460
It's a contract relationship

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.460
So

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.460
Will not be affected by another country

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.460
Is there a contract

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.460
Unless they are in today

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.460
In the contract

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.460
In the contract

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.460
Directly say

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.460
Must have someone

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.460
To sign

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.460
Must have someone

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.460
Approve

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.460
This

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:53.460
The contract is effective

01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:54.460
Otherwise

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.460
Basically speaking

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.460
Established in

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.460
Every

01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.460
Signed between countries

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.460
Any other country

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.460
No money

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.460
Does not affect the efficiency of the contract

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.460
In fact, in this place

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.460
San Francisco Treaty

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.460
That

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.460
San Francisco member

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:10.460
Not only China

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.460
The Soviet Union did not sign

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.460
The Soviet Union is actually today

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.460
Have not signed a peace treaty with Japan

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.460
Peace Treaty

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.460
From the Soviet Union to today

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.460
Have not signed a peace treaty with Japan

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.460
That

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.460
Wait a minute

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.460
Because I don't quite understand

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.460
What is the contract for?

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.460
Is to end the war between

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.460
End the war between the country and the country

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.460
The state of war

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.460
Then there is

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.460
Determine the compensation between countries

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.460
So

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:36.460
I can understand

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:37.460
So this contract

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.460
As long as Japan unilaterally recognizes it

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:40.460
From each country

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.460
Can complete

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:42.460
No country

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.460
Does it matter to sign?

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.460
No

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:46.460
Signed country

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.460
Signed country

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.460
To end

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.460
The war between him and Japan

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.460
If you don't sign

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:52.460
War

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.460
Will continue to exist

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:54.460
So

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:55.460
So that means

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.460
China is now

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:57.460
Theoretically still

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.460
In the state of war with Japan

01:17:58.460 --> 01:17:59.460
No

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:00.460
Because we haven't finished the history

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:02.460
Sorry

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.460
Because you don't have to sign

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.460
You want

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.460
You can sign another contract with Japan

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.460
Contract

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.460
In other words

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.460
In other words

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.460
Not just able to sign

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:12.460
This kind of contract

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:13.460
Every country

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.460
Because

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.460
Just say we are so

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.460
For example, if there are 50 people today

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:17.460
Right

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.460
Fifty people fight a group

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.460
Then

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.460
Fifty people fight a man

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.460
Then this person

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:23.460
With everyone

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.460
Everyone makes an agreement

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:26.460
Some people say

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:27.460
We use this set today

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.460
Use this set of rules

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.460
This condition

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:31.460
We

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:32.460
I made an agreement with you

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.460
In fact, he said this set

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:34.460
Condition

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:35.460
I am not satisfied

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:36.460
I want to talk about it again

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:37.460
Yes

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:38.460
So that's the state

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:39.460
You can also

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.460
With those countries that do not sign the agreement

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.460
In another contract

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.460
To end their

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.460
The state of war

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:45.460
Not just able to sign

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.460
Not

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.460
When you

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.460
Between two countries

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:49.460
You want to end the state of war

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.460
Just sign a contract

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.460
But

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.460
In the case of so many countries

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.460
Can

01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:55.460
You can have

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.460
For example, 50

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.460
Fifty

01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.460
Allied soldiers

01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.460
You can sign with Japan

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.460
Is

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.460
Between 1 to 50

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:04.460
Between

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.460
This contract

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.460
To end this state of war

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:07.460
But if

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:08.460
For example, like here

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.460
There are 48 members

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:12.460
Decided to sign a treaty with Japan

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.460
That

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.460
It's these 48 countries

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.460
The state of war with Japan

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.460
Just based on the treaty to end

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:19.460
Ok

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.460
Then the rest did not sign

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.460
They just

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.460
In addition, use other ways to end

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.460
Maybe it's a contract

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.460
Maybe it's in other forms

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.460
For example, some are

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.460
What to publish

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.460
To replace

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:34.460
The same

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.460
The same

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.460
To achieve that goal

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.460
But we are talking about

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.460
48 countries

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.460
48 allied soldiers

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.460
Signed with Japan

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.460
In the end, only 45 were approved

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460
That

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.460
In addition, there are those three that are not

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.460
They are actually later

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.460
Also use other ways to contact

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.460
The state of war with Japan

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.460
Correct

01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:57.460
This is

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.460
It's quite interesting

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.460
That is to say, this one

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.460
Maybe someone will say

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.460
Is the allied forces coming together?

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:03.460
No

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:04.460
That is

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.460
Countries

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.460
Just gather together

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.460
But he did not stipulate that

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.460
Must be consistent

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.460
Then all the same action

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.460
To count

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.460
No

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.460
Each country

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.460
Is an individual right

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.460
Individuals can go to Japan to sign a treaty

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.460
This is a country with its own

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.460
That

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.460
Because of that

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.460
Uh

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.460
There is another one

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.460
This participant

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.460
He has a question

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.460
That

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.460
That is

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.460
China did not sign a treaty with Japan

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.460
And so on

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.460
This question of Taiwan

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:37.460
I think

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.460
This discussion is probably

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.460
Probably answered this question

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.460
Because we are a little late now

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.460
That

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:45.460
Uh

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.460
Let's

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.460
The user's question

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.460
If he feels that it has not been fully answered

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.460
After the speech

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.460
Ask again

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:53.460
Then talk about the parts that have not been answered

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.460
OK?

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:55.460
Then you end it first

01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:56.460
OK

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.460
That user

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.460
Sorry

01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:59.460
That

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.460
Because China later

01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:02.460
Signed with Japan

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.460
Ha ha ha

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:04.460
OK

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.460
it is good

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.460
That

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.460
April 19, 1952

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.460
Then of course

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:09.460
Posted that

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:10.460
Private message

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.460
That message said

01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.460
Taipeng resident

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.460
The expiration date of the TPP Treaty

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.460
Japanese nationality

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:16.460
That

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:17.460
TPP Treaty

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.460
April 28, 1952

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:20.460
So

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.460
From that day on

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:25.460
Taiwan and Penghu are no longer Japanese territory

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.460
Then the sovereignty is in an uncertain state

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.460
Then

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.460
Taipeng resident

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.460
He is no longer Japanese nationality

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.460
No more Japanese

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.460
Yes

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.460
Now there are some people in Taiwan and Penghu

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.460
There are still Japanese nationalities

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.460
This is not always understood in international law

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.460
Then let's talk about this thing now

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.460
Is

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.460
China signed a contract with Japan

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:44.460
That is

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:45.460
April 28, 1952

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.460
On the day the contract came into effect

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.460
Japan and the People's Republic of China

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:52.460
Signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:53.460
What about this contract

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.460
Because Japan was there

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.460
He is

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.460
Recognize the People's Republic of China as the Chinese representative government

01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.460
So at this time

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.460
The effect of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:07.460
Is to end the war between China and Japan

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:11.460
So although China did not sign the TPP Treaty

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.460
But

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.460
He signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.460
So it's still the same

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.460
Then there is a point

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.460
In the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:18.460
Article 2

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.460
He clearly stated

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.460
The two sides admitted that Japan had given up Taiwan in the TPP Treaty

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.460
Taipeng

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:25.460
Taipeng

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:29.460
The complete sovereignty of the South China Sea and the West China Sea

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.460
That's it

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:31.460
It's over

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.460
This is about territorial

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:34.460
The part of Taipeng's sovereignty

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.460
That's it

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:39.460
Nothing else

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.460
In fact, in this place

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.460
This second article also means

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.460
The People's Republic of China

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.460
Basically through the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.460
He admitted that in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:51.460
Arrangements for Taiwan's absence

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:52.460
In the fourth article

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:57.460
This includes all the treaties between China and Japan before December 9, 1941

01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:00.460
This also includes the so-called Maguan Treaty

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.460
There will be a question later

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.460
But I will mention

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:05.460
Article 10

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:06.460
Taipeng residents and his descendants

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.460
As a citizen of the People's Republic of China

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:10.460
As a citizen of the People's Republic of China

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:11.460
But here you have to pay special attention

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:12.460
This is a citizen

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.460
You are not

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.460
Take you as

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:16.460
It's called a citizen

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.460
So in other words

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.460
In fact, Taipeng residents and his descendants

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:22.460
For the regime of the People's Republic of China

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.460
Actually not his citizen

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:27.460
He just took it as his citizen

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:30.460
In law

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:34.460
The Sino-Japanese Treaty was enacted on August 5, 1952

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:35.460
it is good

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.460
Then I just said before

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.460
He signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.460
Article 10

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:42.460
The absence of the Sino-Japanese Treaty before December 9, 1941

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.460
All the treaties

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.460
Including the Maguan Treaty

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:48.460
Will Taipeng's sovereignty return to the People's Republic of China?

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.460
That Japanese side is very straightforward

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.460
It seems that in 1964

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.460
The Taiwan Treaty Bureau said directly

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:55.460
Jumped over

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:56.460
We just said

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:58.460
Such a treaty as Taiwan's abandonment

01:23:58.460 --> 01:23:59.460
That is to say

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:00.460
Complete the abandonment of Taiwan

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.460
Once achieved the purpose

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.460
After that, it will only be effective in form

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:05.460
Because this is

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.460
A treaty that has been executed

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:07.460
Even if abandoned

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.460
Abandonment in form

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.460
The event that has been executed

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:14.460
Unable to return to the state of non-execution

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.460
In other words

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:21.460
The Maguan Treaty abandons Taiwan and Penghu to Japan

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:22.460
Abandoned

01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:23.460
Completed

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.460
It's over after the transfer

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.460
After that, even if the Maguan Treaty is abolished

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:29.460
Taiwan and Penghu's sovereignty

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.460
Will not return to the Republic of China because of this

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.460
This is the basic principle of international law

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:38.460
Because it is based on the requirements of legal stability

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.460
Of course, why is this?

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.460
Because

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.460
Because in fact, between the international

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.460
Sometimes in the past

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:44.460
Often because of some war

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.460
There is a problem of territorial partition between each other

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:49.460
So the territory is partitioned

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.460
If it's just between two countries

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:52.460
It doesn't matter if you fight

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.460
Sometimes it will be related to the third country

01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.460
Or even the fourth country, the fifth country

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.460
In this case

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.460
Your territory

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.460
A piece of territory may be partitioned in the middle

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.460
Turn around

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:03.460
Turn a few hands

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:07.460
If you are in the back

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:09.460
For example, if the A country and the B country fight

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.460
Then partition a piece of land

01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.460
Then fight a few battles

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.460
Then the land was later transferred to the F country

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:15.460
Then if later

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.460
Between the A country and the B country

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:21.460
If the treaty on this piece of land was abolished

01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:24.460
Assuming that you can make the territory return to its original state

01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.460
Isn't the territory in the hands of the F country now?

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.460
How do you return to its original state?

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.460
So this is to say

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.460
Because it is based on the principle of legal stability

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:34.460
So like this

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:36.460
You have already

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:38.460
The territory has been partitioned

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.460
You can't say

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:41.460
Because you restore today

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.460
That is to say

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:43.460
This treaty

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.460
The previous treaty was abolished

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.460
Then restore to its original state

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.460
and so

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.460
After the Maguan Treaty was abolished

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:52.460
Then Taiwan and Hong Kong

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.460
Returned to the Republic of China

01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.460
This statement

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:56.460
It's not correct in law

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:58.460
It doesn't make sense in international law

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.460
But this is one of the sayings of the Republic of China

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.460
And then in 1954

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.460
The Republic of China signed with the United States

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.460
Sino-US Joint Transparency Treaty

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.460
What about the treaty?

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.460
It was abolished on March 3

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.460
March 3 next year

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:14.460
Article 2 of the Treaty

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:15.460
Taiwan and Penghu are listed as

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.460
Territory controlled by the Republic of China

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:20.460
In the English version, it is Territory

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.460
In fact, Territory is mainly in this place

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:25.460
Is a region controlled by a regime

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:28.460
In the Chinese version, it is translated as territory

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:31.460
This is a hint of sovereignty

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.460
In fact, the Republic of China

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.460
Do things like this in many places

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.460
In fact, it's just a field

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.460
Just say where you actually control

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.460
It's not about sovereignty

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.460
Sovereignty belongs to you

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.460
But the Republic of China

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.460
He will do it in translation

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:47.460
Then make you feel

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.460
Yeah, does that mean sovereignty?

01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:51.460
Belongs to the Republic of China

01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.460
In fact, the United States is also very clear about this

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.460
So they are in

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.460
The Senate approved the treaty and said directly

01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:57.460
This treaty

01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.460
Will not change the status of Taiwan's legal status

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.460
Uncertain state

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:05.460
On December 5, 1971

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.460
The United Nations General Assembly resolution

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:07.460
The Republic of China regime

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.460
Listed as a representative of the Republic of China

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:10.460
But this resolution did not mention

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.460
Taiwan and Penghu belong to

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.460
Then expelled from the United Nations

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.460
Is the regime of the Republic of China

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.460
Not Taiwan

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:18.460
So someone said

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.460
Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.460
This is not the case

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.460
Because Taiwan has never been

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.460
Never entered the United Nations

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.460
The Republic of China entered the United Nations in 1945

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.460
Then the Republic of China

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:32.460
At that time he was China

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.460
Because at that time

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:34.460
The regime of the People's Republic of China did not exist

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.460
Is the regime of the Republic of China

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:41.460
Is the government of the Republic of China

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.460
Then in 1972

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:44.460
On September 29, Japan changed

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.460
The regime of the People's Republic of China is the government of China

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:51.460
So he did not memorize the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.460
In this case

01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.460
For Japan

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:56.460
Taiwan and Penghu residents are no longer regarded as citizens of the Republic of China

01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:00.460
But residents under the Taiwan Autonomous Region

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.460
In fact, this later

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.460
Extended all the way to

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.460
Just recently

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.460
We have heard some news

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.460
That is, like Japan

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.460
Now Taiwan is in Japan

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.460
If he wants to register

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.460
Or what other registration

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:18.460
His birthplace

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.460
Something like that

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.460
You can write Taiwan directly now

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.460
Instead of writing China

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.460
So this concept

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:28.460
Just came out

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:29.460
OK

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.460
Then in 1979

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:31.460
On January 1, the United States changed

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:35.460
The regime of the People's Republic of China is the government of China

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.460
On April 10, the same year

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:39.460
Taiwan Relations Act was signed

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:42.460
Expired on January 1, 1979

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.460
But the purpose is to maintain

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:46.460
Non-official relations between the United States and Taiwan Penghu residents

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.460
Then it also admitted that

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.460
The United States originally recognized the Republic of China

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.460
This thing

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.460
Now it's the Taiwan Autonomous Region

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:58.460
And this Autonomous Region can be replaced

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.460
Look at the part of Jinma

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.460
This award is

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.460
The point is that these places

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:09.460
Jinma has always been the coast island of mainland China

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:12.460
Then he is different from the legal status of Taiwan Penghu

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:15.460
Because the biggest difference is

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460
Never been cut

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:18.460
Then there is no

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.460
This one behind

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:24.460
The dispute on the territorial settlement treaty

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.460
So Jinmen Mazu

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.460
It's always the territory of China

01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.460
Then the UK is the same

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.460
Can I ask a question?

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:36.460
Just go back to the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.460
I agree with your point

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.460
You said that the defeated country

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.460
Because he surrendered

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.460
So he signed the treaty

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.460
Then put the original

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.460
The original territory

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:52.460
Must give up

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:53.460
Transfer to

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.460
Give up this territory

01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:56.460
That means

01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:59.460
This territory will be returned to

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:01.460
Originally he

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:03.460
Occupied that country

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:04.460
I agree

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.460
But my question is

01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:08.460
If according to this logic

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.460
Why did Japan sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty with the Republic of China?

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.460
When he signed the treaty

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.460
He is with all

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:18.460
The 48 countries that won

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:19.460
All signed

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.460
I said I gave up Taiwan Pengjin

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:22.460
I give up every one

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.460
With the United States

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.460
With France

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.460
He has such a clause

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:27.460
Or he is only

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:31.460
For the Sino-Japanese Treaty signed with the Republic of China

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:32.460
He also mentioned

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:36.460
I give up the sovereignty of Taiwan Pengjin

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.460
Then in the treaty

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.460
There is already

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.460
Including Japan's abandonment of Taiwan Pengjin

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.460
Part

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.460
So he is now

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.460
Between Japan and the Republic of China

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.460
In addition

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.460
This thing is because of China

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.460
Because at that time

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.460
China because of the issue of representative rights

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:53.460
So there is no way to sign

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.460
Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.460
But the war between China and Japan

01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:00.460
Still have to end

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.460
So Japan is with

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:04.460
The Chinese representative government he recognized

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.460
Signed this Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.460
There is a very important part in this

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.460
Is to say

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:12.460
Is the part about Taiwan and Pengjin

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.460
That part about Taiwan and Pengjin

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.460
He is here

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.460
Especially with the Republic of China

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:19.460
Signed this thing

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.460
To say OK

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.460
Both sides admit

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.460
Japan has been in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.460
Did you give up this part of the sovereignty?

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:27.460
That's it

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.460
So actually it should be said

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:30.460
That is to say, for Japan

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:31.460
He is with all the countries

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.460
About Taiwan and Pengjin

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:37.460
Part of the territory

01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:38.460
The conditions are the same

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.460
It's all Japan

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.460
Gave up the sovereignty of Taiwan Pengjin

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:44.460
It's all the same thing here

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:45.460
I have a

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:46.460
I have a metaphor, OK?

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.460
Because I think you are

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:50.460
It seems to make sense

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:52.460
But there is a little bit of no sense

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.460
I said it was a common sense

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.460
Suppose there is a pair

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.460
There is a

01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:00.460
There is a person who went to rob

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.460
A robbed B's child

01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.460
And then a few years later

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.460
B retaliated

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.460
Then B

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.460
He has a bigger fist

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.460
He won the war

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.460
And now

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.460
He wants to deal with this now

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.460
The thing about the kid who was robbed

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:18.460
He signed a contract

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.460
Then according to your statement

01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:21.460
It's a bit like A signed

01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.460
Signed this contract with B

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.460
In the contract

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:26.460
He just said he gave up this kid

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.460
He didn't say this kid

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.460
Must belong to B

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:30.460
I think you gave me this

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.460
The logic of the deduction is like that

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.460
So what I mean is

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.460
So why did he follow

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.460
So the first thing is

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.460
He signed this thing with B

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:42.460
A and B have such behavior

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:44.460
Is a

01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.460
A has been established in a

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.460
Under a very special relationship

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:50.460
The two of them will do it again

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:51.460
A contract like this

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.460
No, there is no special relationship

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:55.460
Because in fact they are all

01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:57.460
They are all

01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:59.460
There is a war with Japan

01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:00.460
So for Japan

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.460
He just wants to solve this problem

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:03.460
So I have to sign this

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.460
Basically

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.460
The content of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.460
Originally

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:08.460
Originally

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:09.460
Basically the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:10.460
Originally

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.460
I think

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:13.460
Let's leave this question

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.460
Let's discuss it in the last Q&A

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.460
Because this is more like a question of interpretation

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:19.460
This is not an objective fact

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:21.460
Just answer it

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:22.460
Because I think

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.460
In fact, the objective fact is also very simple

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.460
Basically

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:26.460
For Japan

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.460
Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.460
Why did he sign this thing

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.460
Because actually the original Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.460
The original draft is not like this

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:32.460
The original draft is not like this

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.460
The original content of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:36.460
In fact, it is not much different from the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.460
But then I found out

01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.460
Why repeat these things

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.460
Because in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:44.460
Article 26

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.460
It directly says that Japan

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.460
In the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.460
For example, within two years

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:52.460
You can sign with other countries

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.460
That is, the content of the treaty is consistent

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:57.460
Some other contracts that are similar to the content of the treaty

01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:00.460
To end the state of war between each other

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.460
So for Japan

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.460
He signed this with the Republic of China

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.460
Because Japan is not only signed with the Republic of China

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:06.460
He also signed with India

01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:08.460
And with

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:10.460
And some other countries

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.460
Also signed contracts

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.460
But when signing these contracts

01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:14.460
In fact, it is

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.460
It's like adding up

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.460
Some of the things in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:19.460
So for Japan

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.460
He just didn't sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:23.460
Or signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:25.460
But no approved countries

01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.460
In addition to signing the treaty

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.460
And then go

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.460
Officially confirm the state of war between each other

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.460
That's it

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.460
That

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:33.460
The current situation is that

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:34.460
Because now there is a point

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:37.460
Japan signed with the Republic of China today

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:38.460
This thing

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:40.460
With Japan

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:41.460
He signed in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.460
He just said

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:43.460
I have already made it very clear

01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.460
China also admitted

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.460
This is the arrangement of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:47.460
Republic of China

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.460
He also admitted

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:50.460
This is how the Sino-Japanese Treaty is handled

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.460
He can't do it here

01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:53.460
Further processing

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:55.460
In fact, it is the Republic of China

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:56.460
I admit

01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:57.460
That's it

01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.460
The result is like this

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.460
I can't handle it anymore

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.460
Because Japan and the Republic of China

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.460
He can't sign anything else

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.460
Because Japan has given up

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.460
In fact, he has given up

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:09.460
He just told the Republic of China

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:10.460
He told the Republic of China

01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:11.460
I have given up these things

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.460
You can't ask me for anything anymore

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.460
I can't give you anything

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:16.460
So the Republic of China said

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:17.460
OK, I admit

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.460
I admit that you have given up here

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:20.460
OK

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.460
I can't ask you for anything

01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:23.460
You can't give me anything anymore

01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:24.460
In Japan

01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:26.460
Through this form

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:27.460
Off the hook

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:28.460
For example

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:29.460
Yes, I am already in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:31.460
I have already given up on the sovereignty of Taiwan

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.460
To the world

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.460
Then

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:35.460
It's not my business anymore

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.460
None of my business

01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.460
Then I signed with the Republic of China today

01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:39.460
Make it clear

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.460
Although this place is now occupied

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:43.460
But I have already said

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:44.460
I have already given up on this thing

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:45.460
I have already given up

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:46.460
It's none of my business

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.460
You can't ask me for anything

01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:50.460
So this is actually the effect of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:51.460
That is

01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:52.460
This kind of blood

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:53.460
Is to let China

01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:55.460
The Republic of China can't do anything with Japan

01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.460
The Republic of China can only admit

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.460
OK

01:35:58.460 --> 01:35:59.460
It's over like this

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.460
The situation is like this

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:04.460
In fact, the Republic of China also thinks

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.460
The status of Taiwan is not necessarily better

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.460
It's not because of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:09.460
Signed like this

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:10.460
Then I felt

01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.460
Taiwan is like this

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.460
Then I went back to him again

01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:13.460
Of course

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.460
How he talks to the Taiwanese

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.460
That's another thing

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:19.460
But the Republic of China is very clear about this

01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:21.460
OK

01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:24.460
That

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.460
So I say this conclusion

01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.460
This part of Taiwan and Penghu

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.460
This is the first place in the law

01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.460
The ownership of sovereignty is not decided

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.460
Does not belong to any country

01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:32.460
But this is also special

01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.460
Taiwan and Penghu are basically

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.460
Basically speaking

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.460
Before giving up in Japan

01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:38.460
Sovereignty belongs to Japan

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.460
But it is the colonial territory of Japan

01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.460
So basically speaking

01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:44.460
After World War II

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.460
The so-called international consensus

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:47.460
The colonial territory is basically

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.460
To give the people of the colonial territory the right to self-determination

01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:51.460
So from this perspective

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:52.460
Taiwan and Penghu

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.460
In its original status as a colonial territory

01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:56.460
He has the right

01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.460
Taiwanese citizens have the right to decide to return

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.460
That part of China

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:02.460
The regime of the Republic of China did not get it

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:03.460
The People's Republic of China regime

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:05.460
The regime of the Republic of China did not get it

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.460
So he can't claim

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:08.460
By inheriting the Republic of China

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:10.460
To obtain this sovereignty

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.460
Some people claim that Taiwan and Penghu

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.460
Sovereignty now belongs to the United States

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.460
But the United States is just one of the allies

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.460
There is no international document

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.460
Hand Taiwan's sovereignty over to the United States

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.460
So there is no such thing

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.460
Someone else said

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:25.460
Taiwan's sovereignty now belongs to the allies

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:26.460
This is also a joke

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:27.460
because

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.460
The allied forces only carry out military occupation authorization

01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.460
That's the same thing in the Sino-Taiwan Treaty

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.460
Japan just gave up

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:36.460
Did not say that the sovereignty was transferred to the allied forces

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.460
So Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.460
It will not belong to the allied forces

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.460
Someone else said

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:43.460
Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to the people of Taiwan

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:44.460
But in fact, territorial sovereignty

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.460
Only the country can claim

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:47.460
and so

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.460
Can't mix with national sovereignty

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.460
The current status of self-determination is

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:53.460
The Republic of China regime

01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:54.460
Under the authorization of the allied forces

01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.460
Established occupation self-government institutions

01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.460
Taiwan's own authorities

01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:58.460
Occupying

01:37:58.460 --> 01:37:59.460
In governance

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.460
That allied force established

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.460
The Republic of China established this occupation self-government institution

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:08.460
At first it was the so-called Taiwan Provincial Executive Office

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.460
Later it became the Taiwan Provincial Government

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.460
Then later

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:14.460
Because of a series of new provinces

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:16.460
After the Dong Province and the Jin Province

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.460
The main functions and roles

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.460
Basically

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:23.460
Have been taken over by the central government of the Republic of China regime

01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:25.460
So we see

01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:27.460
It was originally the Taiwan Province

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:29.460
The so-called Taiwan Province of the Republic of China

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:31.460
Later, Taipei City became the Executive Office

01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.460
The Executive Yuan directly managed

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:34.460
Later, Kaohsiung City came out

01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.460
And now it has become a six-capital city

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.460
That basically

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.460
Some of these from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China

01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:44.460
These so-called Executive Offices

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.460
Basically equal to the Republic of China

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.460
It has taken all its governance

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.460
In their own hands

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.460
The Taiwan Provincial Government

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.460
Basically speaking

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:53.460
Already

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:54.460
Degraded

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:55.460
And now

01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.460
The personnel has been reorganized to the National Development and Reform Commission

01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.460
So in fact, the whole Taiwan

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:02.460
Now the whole governance

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.460
It's the Republic of China regime itself

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:05.460
In operation

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:07.460
OK

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:08.460
That's basically the part of the Ma group

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:10.460
The rule of law has always been China

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.460
What about the governance part?

01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:13.460
It's the Republic of China regime

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.460
It's the Chinese regime

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:17.460
One of the two major regimes

01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.460
China

01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:19.460
The Republic of China regime

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:20.460
Now it is governed

01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.460
So that's the way it is

01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:24.460
That is

01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:25.460
To show off

01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.460
It's China

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.460
It's two regimes

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:28.460
The two regimes have their own jurisdiction

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:29.460
Different ranges

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:30.460
These are all belong to

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:31.460
Mainland China

01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:32.460
Hong Kong and Macau

01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:34.460
The Ma group is the so-called Chinese territory

01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:35.460
The part of the sovereign territory

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:37.460
That's another piece

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:40.460
It is the Allied Forces that authorizes the Republic of China regime

01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.460
Establish the Allied Forces Occupation Organization

01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:44.460
Then come to govern

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.460
Taiwan and Penghu

01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:47.460
That is currently the status of the sovereign

01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.460
That governance

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:49.460
The power comes from the Allied Forces

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.460
All the way down

01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:52.460
That is to say

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:54.460
The Allied Forces were the victors

01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:55.460
The victor

01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:58.460
The victor is the loser

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:01.460
Occupy the territory

01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:03.460
And then because of the loser

01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:04.460
After giving up the territory

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:05.460
but

01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:08.460
The final disposal of its territory is not certain

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.460
So people still maintain

01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.460
A state of continued management

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:13.460
So this is the current legal status

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.460
Of course this is my research

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:16.460
That

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:19.460
Maybe someone has other different opinions

01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:20.460
But basically

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:21.460
This is from me

01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:23.460
I personally from the perspective of international law

01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:26.460
The results of my research

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:27.460
OK

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:30.460
Then

01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:31.460
Taiwan is a country

01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:32.460
In fact, this statement

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.460
Some people think it is already

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.460
Some people say that in 1949

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.460
Taiwan is already a country

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.460
but

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:40.460
This is a problem

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.460
That is to say

01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.460
At that time, Taiwan's sovereignty was still Japan

01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:45.460
How do you use Taiwan to build a country

01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.460
This is a very strange thing

01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:48.460
Another year

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.460
On October 25, 1971

01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:51.460
Also represented China in the United Nations

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.460
So if you say you built a country in 1949

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.460
That one

01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.460
If it's not China

01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:59.460
How do you represent China in the United Nations

01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:02.460
And another thing is

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.460
With him

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:04.460
Build a country with China

01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.460
Still regard it as China

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:07.460
At least before October 25, 1971

01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:09.460
The United States was before 1979

01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:10.460
Right?

01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:11.460
Still think

01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.460
It represents China

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.460
It's all China

01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:15.460
Then there are people who claim that

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:16.460
After giving up because of Japan

01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:17.460
Taiwan

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:18.460
Then it becomes an unoccupied territory

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:19.460
So you can occupy an unoccupied territory

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:20.460
Then it becomes its territory

01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:22.460
But now there is a problem

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:23.460
That is to say

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:24.460
On the International Law

01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:25.460
For the so-called unoccupied land

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:26.460
There is a strict requirement

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.460
Now the so-called unoccupied land

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:31.460
It is the so-called uninhabited island that can claim to occupy the unoccupied land

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.460
Or no one

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:34.460
Long-term residence

01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:35.460
That place

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:36.460
That place will become

01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.460
Unoccupied land

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:38.460
Appropriate object

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:39.460
Then we know that

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:40.460
In fact, Taiwan and Penghu

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:44.460
In fact, there are millions of people on it for a long time

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.460
Millions of people now live on it

01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.460
Then there are social

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:49.460
Social life

01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:51.460
Organized operation

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:52.460
There is economic life

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.460
So it won't be

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.460
It won't be an uninhabited island

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:56.460
So you can't use it

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:58.460
The sovereignty of the unoccupied land

01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.460
The Republic of China regime

01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:01.460
Has not yet announced the establishment of a new country

01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:03.460
So it's all the same

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:04.460
Same as above

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:07.460
It's all the same in the United Nations

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:09.460
Some people say that in 1971

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.460
The Republic of China was kicked out of the United Nations

01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.460
After the founding of the country

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:13.460
This is also very interesting

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.460
In fact, it is still the same

01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:16.460
It has never been announced

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:18.460
Has not yet announced the establishment of a new country

01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:19.460
Then

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:21.460
In fact, the Republic of China regime in 1979

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.460
After being kicked out of the United Nations

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:24.460
The so-called Republic of China

01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:25.460
After being kicked out of the United Nations

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:26.460
In fact, there are many countries

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:27.460
Admit that he is the representative of China

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:28.460
Right

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:29.460
Like the United States

01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.460
It was only changed in 1979

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.460
Panama

01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.460
It was only over in 2017

01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:34.460
Right

01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:36.460
So there are many countries

01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:37.460
Think he is the Chinese regime

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:39.460
So he never established

01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:42.460
A new country that is different from China

01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:45.460
Never did this thing

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:46.460
It's all the same

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.460
Then someone else said

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:48.460
In 1996

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:51.460
The presidential election of the Republic of China regime

01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:53.460
So the founding of the country

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:54.460
This is also very interesting

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.460
Still the same

01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:56.460
The same questions are all the same

01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.460
Another one is

01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:58.460
The candidate did not say

01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:00.460
Announce the establishment of a new country

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.460
In 1996

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:05.460
The presidential election of the Republic of China regime

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.460
Li Denghui was elected

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.460
Li Denghui

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:10.460
At that time, the Chinese Kuomintang was the chairman

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:11.460
Then we all know that the Chinese Kuomintang

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:14.460
Is a regime that advocates unification

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:19.460
So the chairman of a regime that advocates unification

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:21.460
Elected president

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.460
How could you

01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:23.460
Because he elected the president

01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:26.460
Then establish a country

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.460
This is also incomprehensible

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:29.460
The other point is

01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:30.460
You can't choose

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:33.460
The president of the A country to establish the B country

01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:37.460
Is there such an example in history?

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:39.460
Then someone else said

01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:40.460
The Chinese Kuomintang did not work before

01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.460
Then change to the Democratic Party

01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.460
Then someone said

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:47.460
In 2000, 2004, Chen Shui-bian was elected

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:48.460
Basically the same as before

01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:49.460
Chen Shui-bian was elected

01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:52.460
He did not advocate the establishment of a new country

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.460
The other important thing is

01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.460
In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou was elected president

01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:59.460
If today

01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:02.460
Chen Shui-bian elected the president of the Republic of China

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:05.460
He will represent the establishment of the Republic of Taiwan

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:08.460
Today, when Ma Ying-jeou was elected president

01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.460
What about the previous Republic of Taiwan?

01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:12.460
Is there such a thing as extinction?

01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.460
So this is a very strange statement

01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:15.460
It is impossible for you to say

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:17.460
Which one to choose

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:19.460
To be the leader of a certain regime

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.460
To establish another country

01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:23.460
That is incomprehensible

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.460
Then someone said

01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.460
Because there is no complete governance

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.460
So Chen Shui-bian has no complete governance

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:29.460
So that doesn't count

01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.460
In 2016, Tsai Ing-wen took over

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:33.460
Taiwan is the same

01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:34.460
It's all the same in front

01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.460
These are all the same problems

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:37.460
Have appeared

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:38.460
In addition, by taking over

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:39.460
To establish another country

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:41.460
There is no potential

01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.460
Then this is what I just said

01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:47.460
Panama changed its name to the People's Republic of China regime

01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:49.460
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China is still talking about

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:51.460
The two countries are more than a century apart

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.460
So even if Tsai Ing-wen's regime

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:55.460
Tsai Ing-wen as president

01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:56.460
This regime of the People's Republic of China

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.460
He is still

01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:00.460
The same relationship with other countries

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:01.460
All the way back to China

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.460
Relations with other countries

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.460
So it won't be another country

01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.460
So Taiwan is not a country yet

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:12.460
Then this situation is more direct

01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:15.460
For example, the so-called diplomatic countries of the People's Republic of China

01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:16.460
This is Fan Ligang

01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:17.460
There is that website below

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.460
This is actually

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.460
On the official website of Fan Ligang

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:23.460
The national flag of the People's Republic of China is written on the side of China

01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:26.460
Now many people say this is the national flag of Taiwan

01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:29.460
Then another example is Honduras

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.460
It's the same

01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.460
China

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:32.460
Taiwan is written behind

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:33.460
Taiwan is written behind

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:36.460
What does Taiwan mean?

01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:38.460
Is China equal to Taiwan?

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.460
China on Taiwan

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.460
China in Taiwan

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:41.460
I don't know

01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:42.460
China is in Taiwan

01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:43.460
China is in Taiwan

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:44.460
China is Taiwan

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.460
I don't know

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:48.460
He used this form to express

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:49.460
Then another like Guatemala

01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.460
It's the same

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:51.460
He also wrote like this

01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.460
So this is actually

01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.460
You know he

01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.460
Taiwan's current state

01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.460
Other countries

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.460
Even the diplomatic countries of the People's Republic of China

01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:03.460
When dealing with Taiwan

01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:04.460
He still has no way

01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:06.460
Take the piece of China

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.460
So if you want to say

01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:10.460
Taiwan is already

01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.460
A sovereign independent country

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.460
That has nothing to do with the country

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.460
You will find that in fact

01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:16.460
Not so much

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.460
OK

01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.460
In the future

01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:21.460
What should I do?

01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.460
How to build

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.460
Actually I want to say

01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:25.460
Sorry

01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.460
We can end

01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:28.460
In Taiwan's current history

01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:29.460
Is the current international law positioning?

01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.460
Because it's too long

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:31.460
Yes

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.460
OK

01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:33.460
Then let's go back

01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:35.460
You just wrote a line of red paper

01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:37.460
Taiwan is not a country now

01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:38.460
This page is good

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:39.460
OK

01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:42.460
Sorry

01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:43.460
I want to interrupt you

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.460
Because today is really too long

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.460
I think this is a very conclusive conclusion

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.460
Just take away

01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.460
Based on international law

01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:53.460
Taiwan is not a country now

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.460
If we have a chance

01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:57.460
You can

01:46:57.460 --> 01:46:59.460
We are looking for you to talk about this

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:00.460
The last part

01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:01.460
That is

01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:02.460
I'm sorry

01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:03.460
It's okay

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:04.460
This thing is really

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:05.460
I originally wanted to

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.460
It's complicated

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:08.460
I originally wanted to cut it short

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.460
I found out

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:10.460
It seems to be impossible

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.460
OK

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:13.460
OK

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.460
Before we start asking questions

01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:16.460
Still the same

01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.460
Please turn on the microphone

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:18.460
Then we applaud again

01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:19.460
Thank you, Shen Feng

01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.460
Thank you

01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.460
Thank you

01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.460
OK

01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:26.460
Do you have any questions?

01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.460
Or comment?

01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:30.460
Because I just interrupted

01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:31.460
There may be one or two questions

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.460
That can be discussed now

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.460
Does anyone want to mention it?

01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:39.460
That Sino-Japanese contract

01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:43.460
Yes, but he

01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:49.460
Because after he finished asking

01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:50.460
It's been a long time

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.460
Maybe there is an answer

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:53.460
Let's just ask

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:54.460
Who else has any questions now?

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:55.460
Do you want to mention it?

01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.460
Just based on

01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:58.460
After listening to everything

01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.460
Is there anyone who wants to ask a question?

01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:05.460
OK

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:06.460
That means today's speech

01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:07.460
I can ask

01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:08.460
OK

01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:09.460
You say

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:10.460
In fact, it is

01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:11.460
In the count

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:12.460
Two

01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:13.460
PowerPoint

01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:15.460
I already have a little lost

01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:16.460
You are here

01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:18.460
For example, on this PowerPoint

01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:19.460
It says

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.460
Is Taiwan already a country?

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.460
Your Taiwan here

01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:25.460
This territory

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:27.460
The people on this territory

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:29.460
Republic of China government

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.460
Democratic Progressive Party government

01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:32.460
What is Taiwan here?

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:34.460
This Taiwan

01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.460
In fact, it is not

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.460
Democratic Progressive Party government

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:38.460
Those things

01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:39.460
But just say

01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.460
Now in Taiwan

01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:43.460
Is this piece

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:44.460
Taiwan

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:45.460
With the island of Taiwan

01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.460
With the surrounding area

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:48.460
With

01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:51.460
Penghu Islands

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.460
On this piece

01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:55.460
These lands

01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:56.460
With the group

01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:57.460
The group of people above

01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.460
With the above

01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:00.460
The current governance

01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:01.460
That regime

01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:02.460
With this

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.460
Wrap it up like this

01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:04.460
This piece

01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:05.460
This thing

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.460
Is it a country?

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:08.460
Is this territory

01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.460
This people

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:10.460
This above

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.460
Governance

01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.460
Government

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:14.460
Government

01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.460
Government

01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:16.460
This government

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.460
This regime

01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:19.460
I'm not talking about the government

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:20.460
Is the governing regime above

01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:21.460
Will he

01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:22.460
Is he

01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:23.460
Is it

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:24.460
Can this be regarded as a country?

01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:25.460
Is it a country?

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:27.460
Is it a country on the international community?

01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:29.460
Then you think

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.460
It's not a country

01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:32.460
The reason is because of this territory

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:34.460
And the people above

01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:36.460
Still undetermined

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:39.460
The territory is undetermined

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.460
The territory is undetermined

01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.460
Because the territory belongs

01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:45.460
Which country does it belong to?

01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:46.460
Unknown

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:47.460
The territory is undetermined

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.460
Then above this

01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:51.460
Republic of China regime

01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.460
Above this

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.460
Republic of China regime itself

01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:55.460
He is the Chinese regime

01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:58.460
If he says today

01:49:58.460 --> 01:49:59.460
If it is to be determined

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:01.460
If it is a country

01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:03.460
He is also a

01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:04.460
He is just China

01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.460
He won't be

01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:07.460
And there is no

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:08.460
China with air sovereignty

01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:10.460
Because

01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:12.460
Air sovereignty does not belong to any country

01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:14.460
So even if he is a country

01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.460
Republic of China regime

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.460
Even if it's a country

01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:18.460
He is also in China

01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:19.460
As a fugitive government

01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:21.460
In Taiwan

01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:22.460
Because

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.460
The country he represents is China

01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:25.460
Not Taiwan

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:27.460
Because

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:28.460
Taiwan and Penghu's sovereignty

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:29.460
Does not belong to him

01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:30.460
Of course, Taiwan and Penghu

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.460
Is being governed by him

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:32.460
That's right

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:33.460
but

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.460
He is not

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:35.460
His territorial scope

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:37.460
Does not include Taiwan and Penghu

01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:38.460
So now this

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:39.460
A state

01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.460
That is to say, Taiwan and Penghu

01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:41.460
Now govern his

01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.460
That regime

01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:43.460
Does not have

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:44.460
He is not a

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.460
A country

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.460
As a government

01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.460
To govern

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:50.460
He is not a

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.460
A territorial form

01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:52.460
He is just a

01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:53.460
Manager role

01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:55.460
And his role as a manager

01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:56.460
Is

01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:57.460
In 1945

01:50:57.460 --> 01:50:59.460
Under the auspices of the Allied Forces

01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:00.460
What happened

01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:02.460
So now the situation is

01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:06.460
I'm talking about this part of Taiwan now

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.460
The main thing is

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.460
The part of the land and the people

01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:11.460
The regime above

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:12.460
Because of his

01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.460
Chinese regime

01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.460
And China

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.460
Never got

01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.460
Air sovereignty

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:18.460
This matter

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.460
Will become

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:21.460
He has no way

01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:23.460
With Taiwan and Penghu

01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.460
This part

01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.460
Just become a country

01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:27.460
Because

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:30.460
There is no territorial relationship between the two

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:31.460
He is a

01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:33.460
Actually in

01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.460
A state of governance

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:37.460
That

01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.460
There is another one here

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.460
That participant has a question

01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:42.460
But in

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:43.460
I'll ask him later

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:44.460
Because he is typing

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:45.460
But before asking

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:46.460
I have a little comment

01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:47.460
To tell everyone

01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:48.460
Just

01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:50.460
I want to use

01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:52.460
Shen Feng and Kiki's conversation

01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:53.460
As an example

01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:55.460
Project Taira's purpose

01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:57.460
Is to make it possible

01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:58.460
In different parts of the world

01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:00.460
Because Kiki is actually in California now

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:03.460
Shen Feng is in Edinburgh

01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:04.460
I personally think

01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:06.460
You can have a good conversation

01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:07.460
From different points of view

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:09.460
Create a good study of Taiwan

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:10.460
That

01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:11.460
Because I happen to know both of them

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.460
So if you need

01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:14.460
Leave the other party's contact information

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:15.460
You can ask me

01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:16.460
Or

01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:18.460
On Project Taira's website

01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:20.460
There should be members

01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:21.460
A personal page

01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:22.460
Can find a way to contact

01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:23.460
Then I really strongly

01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:25.460
You should continue to communicate

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.460
Ok

01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:27.460
This is my comment

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.460
Sorry

01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:29.460
What is the direct relationship with the researcher

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:30.460
But

01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:32.460
This Liu

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.460
He is Liu

01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:34.460
Say

01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.460
That old national law

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:38.460
How can Taiwan and Penghu be considered a country?

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:41.460
If Taiwan and Penghu finally broke up with the Republic of China regime

01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.460
Do you have to break up with Jinma?

01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:44.460
Then I think this is

01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:45.460
The part I just cut off

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.460
right

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:48.460
Yes yes yes

01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:49.460
Please continue

01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.460
Pick a few

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:51.460
Just for this question

01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:53.460
See how you answer

01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.460
Ok

01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:56.460
Then we will

01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:58.460
Take a look

01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:01.460
So you see

01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:03.460
This thing still wants to talk about it

01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:07.460
Ok good

01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.460
That means everyone is very interested in this topic

01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:10.460
Yes yes yes

01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:11.460
Because the key is here

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:12.460
You know the current state

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:13.460
Of course you want to solve the problem

01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:14.460
right

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.460
This is very normal

01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:17.460
Anyway

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.460
Actually

01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.460
How does Taiwan become a country?

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.460
In fact, I am talking now

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:21.460
You want to be a country

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.460
Your purpose is to become one

01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.460
Recognized by the international community

01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:29.460
A political entity that is willing to recognize the status of a country

01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:30.460
So the point is

01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:32.460
You have to follow the rules of international law

01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:36.460
Don't give birth to some other weird things yourself

01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:37.460
Ok

01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:38.460
That is to say, like these

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.460
What I just talked about

01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:41.460
Those

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.460
What I listed before

01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.460
Those

01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:44.460
All the way to 2016

01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:45.460
What is the previous administration

01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.460
These international law

01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:47.460
No potential

01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:49.460
So basically it doesn't make sense

01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:50.460
What else

01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:51.460
There are some

01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:52.460
Prove self-reliance

01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:53.460
Self-reliance

01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:54.460
Self-reliance

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.460
These are all

01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.460
All involve the constitution

01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:59.460
I think it's from the constitution or the name

01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:01.460
This is what I said at the beginning

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.460
There are some national characteristics

01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:05.460
How do you change it

01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:07.460
It won't change its essence

01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:08.460
So today

01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:09.460
No matter how you change your name

01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:10.460
No matter how you make a constitution

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.460
It doesn't matter if it's abolished

01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:14.460
Will not affect the Chinese regime of the Republic of China

01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.460
Taiwan is not a country yet

01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:20.460
You can't build a country through constitution

01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:24.460
You have to build a country first and then constitution

01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:25.460
The other point is

01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:26.460
Taiwan's strength

01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:28.460
Of course there is no way to make international rules by yourself

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:30.460
So it's according to the rules

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.460
According to international rules

01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.460
In the international rules

01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.460
There are rules in international law

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.460
One is the right of self-determination

01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:37.460
So the right of self-determination

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:38.460
The constitution of the United Nations

01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:40.460
Then the civil rights

01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:41.460
Civil rights and political rights

01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:42.460
International Convention

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:43.460
Economic, social, cultural rights

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:44.460
International Convention

01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:47.460
All mentioned the right of self-determination

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:48.460
For Taiwan

01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:51.460
The most important part is to decolonize

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:52.460
Because I mentioned earlier

01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:56.460
Taiwan is the former colony of Japan

01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:57.460
In fact, in principle

01:54:57.460 --> 01:54:58.460
Taiwan as a former colony

01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:59.460
It should be

01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.460
Under the context of decolonization

01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:03.460
The right of self-determination

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:06.460
And then build your own country

01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:07.460
In the U.N. Congress

01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:08.460
In fact, the U.N. Constitution itself

01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:09.460
It has

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:10.460
There is a direct regulation

01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:12.460
To this decolonization part

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.460
Decolonization is the U.N.

01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:16.460
One of the main goals in the Constitution

01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:17.460
In addition, the U.N. Convention

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.460
It also mentions

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:19.460
No. 1 and No. 4

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:20.460
Say

01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:21.460
In the non-intellectual territory of the territory of the jurisdiction

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:22.460
Or other

01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:23.460
Without reaching the territory of independence

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.460
Steps must be taken

01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:25.460
Then everyone

01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:27.460
Help these democracies

01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:29.460
Be able to enjoy complete independence and freedom

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:31.460
So this is also the right of self-determination

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.460
The part of the U.N. Convention

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:36.460
In the other U.N. Convention

01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:37.460
No. 1, 5, 4, 1

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.460
It mentions

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:40.460
When the right of self-determination is exercised

01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:41.460
Non-intellectual territory

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:42.460
That's what it says

01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.460
In order to achieve independence

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.460
These parts of the territory

01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:46.460
Can be achieved in the following way

01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:47.460
Complete self-determination

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.460
First, become a sovereign independent country

01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:51.460
Second, become an independent country

01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:54.460
Or join an independent country

01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:55.460
The so-called sovereign independent country

01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:56.460
Needless to say

01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:57.460
Just become a country

01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:59.460
In addition, become an independent country

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:00.460
This one

01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:01.460
In fact, you are also a country

01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:03.460
It's just that you may have some rights

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.460
Some rights on sovereignty

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:05.460
You just give it to other countries

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:07.460
Help you to execute

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:09.460
For example, like

01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:12.460
The United States used to have some

01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:15.460
According to the U.N. Convention

01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:17.460
Regulations on deportation

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.460
Then give it to the U.S.

01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:20.460
Some of the Pacific Islands

01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:21.460
Some islands

01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:23.460
After they became independent

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.460
They decided to be

01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.460
To become a free party in the United States

01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:30.460
That is to say, they put some rights

01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:32.460
Just give it to the U.S.

01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:33.460
Maybe it's the diplomatic part

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.460
Maybe it's the military part

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.460
They might even be

01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:38.460
Use the U.S. dollar

01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:40.460
Something like this

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:43.460
But these countries themselves still have

01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:46.460
These still have national rights

01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:49.460
The other one is to become an independent country

01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:50.460
So for Taiwan

01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:52.460
The choice after that is

01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:55.460
In fact, it is in the context of colonization

01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:56.460
Execute self-determination

01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:57.460
When it comes to self-determination

01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:00.460
There are these options

01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:01.460
If Taiwan wants to become a country

01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:03.460
That is, when it comes to self-determination

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:08.460
Choose to become a sovereign independent country

01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:10.460
What about the current state?

01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:11.460
In fact, it is important to say

01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.460
First define Taipeng as

01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:16.460
We are now under the arrangement of the Allied Forces

01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:17.460
Members of the Allied Forces

01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.460
For the Allied Forces

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:22.460
The occupation of the occupation

01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:23.460
Occupation in governance

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:24.460
So they belong to

01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:27.460
Not yet reached an independent territory

01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:28.460
If you go through the UN

01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:31.460
If the UN resolution 1514

01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:33.460
The UN member states have the obligation

01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:36.460
To assist Taiwan in gaining independence

01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:38.460
But to be honest

01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:40.460
Taiwan has never advocated this way

01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.460
So we have always advocated

01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:43.460
We are already a country

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:48.460
Then ask people to let us join the United Nations

01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:49.460
In fact, through the original

01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:50.460
I just talked about the United Nations

01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:52.460
The right to self-determination mentioned in the Constitution of the United Nations

01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:55.460
Then the United Nations

01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:58.460
Then the other conventional signatories

01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:00.460
They have no reason to deny

01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:02.460
Taipeng's right to self-determination

01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:04.460
Then you exercise

01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:06.460
The right to self-determination is the same as the right to self-determination

01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:07.460
In fact, the United Nations member states

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:10.460
There is no way to deny the effect of self-determination

01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:13.460
So if Taiwan wants to become a country

01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.460
In fact, it is very important

01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:16.460
You use Taiwan as the host

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:18.460
The identity of the pre-colonial

01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:19.460
Then combined with the international

01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:21.460
Under the consensus of colonization

01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:22.460
Confirm the self-determination of the colony

01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:23.460
According to international convention

01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:26.460
Then ask the United Nations member states to recognize

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.460
This one

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:30.460
I personally think this is the most

01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:33.460
The most feasible route

01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:35.460
This is definitely more than

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:38.460
Now you claim that Taiwan is already a sovereign independent country

01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.460
But you are clearly now

01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:42.460
It's a Chinese exile regime

01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.460
Then you said you want to join the United Nations with this identity

01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:46.460
Will be more effective than that

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:49.460
Because other countries will see that

01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:51.460
You are the Chinese regime

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:52.460
I can't admit you

01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:54.460
He is in the People's Republic of China regime

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:58.460
Choose one with the Republic of China regime

01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:00.460
OK

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:02.460
So that is to say

01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:03.460
In fact, this place just now

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:04.460
In fact, everyone has already talked about it

01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:07.460
If you want to enter the United Nations

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:08.460
This is actually

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.460
I think there is something

01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:10.460
Let me talk a little bit

01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:12.460
Entering the United Nations is not the necessary procedure to build a country

01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.460
Some people say

01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:15.460
What does Taiwan have to enter the United Nations

01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:18.460
To prove that you are a country

01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:22.460
In fact, many countries

01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:24.460
I didn't join the United Nations

01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:26.460
For example, like Switzerland

01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:28.460
I joined the United Nations in 2002

01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:31.460
No other country has ever thought that you

01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:33.460
Switzerland was not a country before 2002

01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:34.460
Right

01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:36.460
He is still a country

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.460
that

01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:38.460
So

01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:40.460
You said you want to join the United Nations to build a country

01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:41.460
This is not right

01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:42.460
This is not right

01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:45.460
You have to build a country first

01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:47.460
So

01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.460
You don't have to join the United Nations after building a country

01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:54.460
The basis of this sentence is the International Law

01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:55.460
Because this is the question of building a country

01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:57.460
But it doesn't matter if you don't build a country and you can't join the United Nations

01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:59.460
It has nothing to do with the International Law

01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:02.460
It is the rule of the United Nations

02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:04.460
No, because the United Nations is

02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:05.460
As I said earlier

02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:06.460
This is the United Nations

02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:08.460
Because the United Nations is an international organization

02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:09.460
He himself

02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:12.460
The requirement of becoming a member is to be a member

02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:14.460
Yes, this is his internal rule

02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.460
He is not part of the International Law

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:18.460
You have to say he is not part of the International Law

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:19.460
In fact, it should be said

02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.460
He set such a rule in accordance with the International Law

02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:24.460
He set such a rule in accordance with the International Law

02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:25.460
That is to say, because the United Nations

02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:26.460
In fact, it is based on the United Nations

02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:29.460
An international organization established by the Constitution

02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:30.460
OK

02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:31.460
Yes

02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:33.460
So we can only talk about it now

02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:34.460
We can only talk about it now

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:36.460
That is to say

02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:38.460
Members of the international organization

02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:40.460
What kind of identity do you need to join

02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:41.460
Is the international organization

02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:42.460
His

02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:44.460
For example, a document like this

02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:46.460
How to write in such a document

02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:48.460
How to decide

02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:51.460
It is not stipulated that this person must be a country

02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:54.460
To join the international organization

02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:56.460
But this rule

02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.460
Is the rule of this international organization

02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:01.460
It was set out in accordance with the International Law

02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:02.460
I see

02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:03.460
Ok, that one

02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.460
Because his question just now is

02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:07.460
What should be done to uphold international law

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.460
He said it could be

02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:11.460
But we are basically talking about

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:12.460
How to become

02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:13.460
But basically

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.460
He turned out to mean the same

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:15.460
How do you become

02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:16.460
How does it count

02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:18.460
So you answered the first question

02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:19.460
Let's talk about the second question directly

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.460
Let's talk about the second question directly

02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:21.460
Let's talk about the second question directly

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:22.460
That is

02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:25.460
Taipeng broke up with the Republic of China

02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:28.460
Do you have to break up with Jinma?

02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:30.460
Oh yes

02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:32.460
But Jinma

02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.460
But Jinma, he can

02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:36.460
They can also exercise self-determination

02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:40.460
What is self-determination

02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:41.460
That is

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:42.460
It should be said like this

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:45.460
That is, Taipeng, you can

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.460
Can be self-determined

02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:49.460
Become a sovereign independent country

02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:50.460
Right

02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:52.460
What about Jinma

02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:54.460
Of course it can

02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:56.460
Because I just mentioned it here

02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:00.460
What about Jinma

02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:02.460
Basically

02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:03.460
Taipeng

02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:04.460
You follow the international law

02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:06.460
Under the context of decolonization

02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:08.460
Exercise self-determination

02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:10.460
Then establish a sovereign independent country

02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:12.460
This is the way Taipeng wants to go

02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:14.460
If you want to be a country

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:15.460
This road is

02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:16.460
I think

02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:20.460
Personally, I think it is the best way

02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:21.460
But part of Jinma

02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:24.460
Because his sovereignty belongs to China

02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:26.460
So what they need to do is

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:27.460
Independent

02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:30.460
To separate from China and come out independently

02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:32.460
Then separate from China and come out independently

02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:34.460
Then you have to have a

02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:36.460
Chinese regime

02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:38.460
To hold such an independent meeting

02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:40.460
So Jinma

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:41.460
He said

02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:42.460
Want to

02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:45.460
If you want to be with Taiwan and Penghu

02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:47.460
That is, Jinma's resident

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.460
He followed the regime of the Republic of China

02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:52.460
Hold a self-determination meeting there

02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:55.460
Then decide whether to be independent from the Republic of China

02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:56.460
Then after independence

02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:57.460
Then see if he wants to

02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:59.460
Become a country here

02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:00.460
Or to join

02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:02.460
The new country established by Taipeng

02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:05.460
This is their choice

02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:09.460
But what I have to say is

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:10.460
Jinma people

02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:13.460
Do they want to be with Taiwan and Penghu

02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:16.460
This is a question mark

02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.460
This is a big question mark

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:20.460
I think sometimes it is like this

02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:22.460
We think they seem to want to be with us

02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:24.460
We seem to want us to abandon them

02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:25.460
Abandon them or something

02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:28.460
But in fact, Jinma people may not think so

02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:31.460
They may not think at all

02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:33.460
I am Taiwanese

02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:34.460
They may

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:36.460
They should basically admit that they are the people of the Republic of China

02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:37.460
No problem

02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.460
The citizens of the Republic of China are OK

02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:41.460
But do they think they are Taiwanese?

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:43.460
Do they want to be with Taiwan?

02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:45.460
This is sometimes a question mark

02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:47.460
Because you see some news

02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:50.460
Jinma people seem

02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.460
They seem to think they are Chinese

02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:54.460
The ratio is higher

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:56.460
Of course we have opened the way for everyone

02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:58.460
There is a way to go in international law

02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:00.460
They hold an independent meeting

02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:02.460
See if they want to be independent from China

02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:04.460
Then move to another country

02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:05.460
They can do

02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:07.460
The other point is that if

02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:09.460
Jinma people

02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:11.460
They can't get through the independent meeting

02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:13.460
Let Jinma become

02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:14.460
Taipeng

02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:16.460
Become the same country as Taipeng

02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:17.460
His people

02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:19.460
He can also be planned

02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:22.460
Become the citizens of this new country

02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.460
In fact, many Jinma

02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:25.460
Jinma people

02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.460
They are actually living on the island of Taiwan now

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:29.460
May be there to get married and have children

02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:31.460
Then buy a house or something

02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:32.460
So for them

02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:34.460
Maybe most of the time they are in Taiwan

02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:36.460
Maybe they think

02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:38.460
Maybe it will become the citizens of Taipeng

02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.460
No problem

02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:42.460
If they don't want to

02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:44.460
They can also be the people of the Republic of China

02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.460
Is a foreigner

02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:48.460
Continue to stay

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.460
In fact, the subsequent disposal

02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.460
There are legal means

02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:54.460
It can be solved

02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:55.460
Just

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.460
It's just that in international law

02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:58.460
If we want to

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.460
If you want to deal with this issue

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:01.460
You have to separate

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.460
Because there is no way to solve the problem together

02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:05.460
If you put it together

02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:07.460
You just mix it up

02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:08.460
The unsettled

02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:10.460
With those who belong to the territory of China

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:12.460
There is no way to do it together

02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:14.460
Because when it comes to processing

02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:16.460
The rules are different

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:18.460
So you have to deal with it

02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:19.460
Must be divided

02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:21.460
But will it be together in the end?

02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.460
That depends on

02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.460
I would think

02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:26.460
It depends on the wishes of the Kinmen people

02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:29.460
I don't know if they want to be with Taiwan

02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:30.460
OK

02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:32.460
So for the second question

02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:34.460
Basically the answer is the first

02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.460
Yes

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:37.460
Have to break up with Kinmen

02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:38.460
The second is

02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:39.460
But Kinmen can be based on

02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:41.460
Is the context of decolonization

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:43.460
Make their own self-awareness

02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:45.460
Kinmen is not the context of decolonization

02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:47.460
Because Kinmen has not been colonized

02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:48.460
OK

02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:49.460
Kinmen they

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:50.460
Because they are independent

02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:52.460
They are directly separated and independent

02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:54.460
Taiwan and Penghu

02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:56.460
Taiwan and Penghu are decolonized

02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.460
Kinmen is separated and independent

02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:00.460
That is to say, separated and independent from China

02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:02.460
Just like Scotland

02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:04.460
Separated from the United Kingdom

02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:06.460
Quebec is separated from Canada

02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:07.460
OK

02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:09.460
Kinmen independence is such a form

02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:11.460
Different from Taiwan

02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:12.460
That

02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:15.460
Liu said thank you for the detailed explanation of the speaker

02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:16.460
Then I think

02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:17.460
Come here today

02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:18.460
Also cover you

02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:19.460
Last

02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:20.460
Sorry

02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:21.460
The part that was cut off by me

02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:22.460
Most of the cut

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.460
I just finished talking

02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.460
OK

02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:26.460
Ok

02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:28.460
We are here again

02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:29.460
Applause

02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:31.460
Thank you for the speech brought to us by Saint

02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:33.460
It's already two o'clock in the middle of the night over there

02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:35.460
Thank you very much

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.460
Thank you

02:06:36.460 --> 02:06:37.460
That

02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:38.460
Everyone is me

02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.460
I want to stop recording first

02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:41.460
But you are welcome to continue discussing

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:42.460
OK
