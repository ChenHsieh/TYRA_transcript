00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,720
Hello everyone, good morning, good afternoon or good evening. I am in California now, so I am very early now. Welcome to today's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:28,320
If you have participated in TerraTalk, you will know that we actually have an academic speech every week. The academic speech is actually for all our members to come up and share their research progress, but we are more special today, so there are more people.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,940
Our topic today is what to do after Ph.D.

4
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,860
Youth Researchers Post-Graduate Development Conference

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,180
I will say it again, what to do after Ph.D.

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,820
Youth Researchers Post-Graduate Development Conference

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,980
Today is not a single speaker's speech.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:01:01,940
The three speakers we mentioned today are Dr. Zhang Mujie, Dr. Zhou Yuxun, and Dr. Su Haowei. They are now distributed around the world in Taiwan, Israel, and Boston, USA, so they are also distributed in various cities.

9
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:10,400
Come and share with us that they are looking for their teeth, this change, and the new path of different positions now.

10
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,200
Let's not say much, let's invite the three speakers to introduce themselves separately.

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,000
At the beginning, I will use the name first, so that everyone does not know who to start with.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,500
Can we first ask Mujie to introduce himself?

13
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,600
Hello everyone, I am Zhang Mujie, and I am now a assistant professor at the University of Taiwan's Department of Chemistry.

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:52,940
I returned to NTU in August last year, so it's been about a year, so if you have any questions, especially those related to Taiwan, you are welcome to ask.

15
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,500
Can you talk about your university, master's degree, and doctoral degree?

16
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:12,260
My university and research institute are both in NTU Department of Chemistry, and after I graduated from my master's degree, I worked as a research assistant for a little over a year.

17
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:28,400
Then I went to the University of Hollingham in the Netherlands to study for my doctorate, and after graduating from my doctorate in 2016, I went to Chicago University in the United States to do post-doctoral research, and came back in 2018.

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:37,360
So I did post-doctoral research for about two years, a little more than two years, and that's about it.

19
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,720
OK, let's ask Haowei to introduce himself.

20
00:02:45,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Hello everyone, my name is Su Haowei, and I am now at Fitbit in Boston. We are a company that makes wearable devices called Fitbit, and I have been working here for about four years, and I have been in Boston for almost nine years.

21
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:15,840
I studied in Taiwan when I was in college, and then I came to the United States to study for my master's degree after I graduated from my doctorate, and then I stayed to work after I finished my studies.

22
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:39,200
In the field of work, I studied imaging in college, such as ultrasound and MRI, and then came here to do research in microfluidics. Now I mainly write algorithms and do some human experiments at work.

23
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:54,960
A small question, so you said that you have been in this company for about four years, and you have been in Fitbit for four years, but you have been there for almost ten years, right? So basically your PhD is in the best school in the world, is that right?

24
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes, because I am talking about this from Caltech now, so I think it should be quite persuasive.

25
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't be in school, don't be in school, really the best school.

26
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:21,440
Okay, so today we have three speakers, and Hao Wei is one of them in the industry. So if you have any questions about the industry, or want to go to the industry in the future, or want to do more applications, you can also ask questions.

27
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you, Hao Wei. Next, Yuxun, please speak.

28
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am completing my PhD.

29
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It is a marriage proposal.

30
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I am doing research in Israel.

31
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sorry, I am interrupting, because it seems like a lot of people can't hear Yuxun's voice.

32
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I am not sure if Yanyong can hear you.

33
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can hear a little bit.

34
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can't hear you well here, and sometimes there is no sound at all, and sometimes there is a little bit.

35
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Let me turn up the battery.

36
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Can you hear me now?

37
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Yes, I can hear you well now.

38
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
That's good.

39
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Okay, let me quickly introduce myself.

40
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
I am an assistant professor at Caltech.

41
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,560
I finished my master's degree in physics at Caltech, and then I went to the National University of Transportation to do my research on nanoparticles.

42
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:21,120
After I finished my research, I went to the University of Michigan to do some physics-related research.

43
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,120
During this year and a half, I was very lucky to have a chance to go to Israel to do my research.

44
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,120
I got a fellowship and went to Israel to do my research.

45
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
During this time, I tried to join the so-called Einstein Project.

46
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
I was very lucky to get this project.

47
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,680
So today, I would like to share some details and skills needed to apply for the Einstein Project.

48
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Also, I would like to share with my friends who are currently studying for a doctorate, what preparations they need to make in order to have a higher application rate for this project in the future.

49
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Okay, so today...

50
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Sorry, let me take a look.

51
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:16,240
So today, Yu-Hsuan will basically answer your questions about the process of applying for the Einstein Project and returning to Taiwan.

52
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,240
In fact, we have another speaker who has also applied for the Einstein Project.

53
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
So there should be different opinions, which you can discuss later.

54
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Okay, give me a second.

55
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I just opened a file and turned it off.

56
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Okay, do you have any questions for the speaker about their background?

57
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Is there anything you want to ask or would like to know more about?

58
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Okay, so...

59
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Hey, did you play in the e-sports scene before?

60
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Yes, I did.

61
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
I think I know you.

62
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Oh, really?

63
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Yes, yes, yes.

64
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I used to be in the e-sports scene.

65
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
I think you played in the e-sports scene for a year or two.

66
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Or was it after Star Cup?

67
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Yes, I played Star Cup for 30 seconds.

68
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Just like Lin Shuhao.

69
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
No, no, no.

70
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Impressive, impressive.

71
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Okay, okay, okay.

72
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Let's continue our serious discussion.

73
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Okay.

74
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
The person I just talked to is Ted.

75
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,920
He works at Tokyo University as a quantum computer scientist.

76
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Okay, let's get straight to our first question of the day.

77
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I'd like to ask the three speakers to briefly summarize

78
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,920
their journey from starting to studying for a doctorate

79
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
to studying for a doctorate.

80
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
After finishing the doctorate,

81
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
they now work in different jobs.

82
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
What are their plans for the future?

83
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
What are their thoughts?

84
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
And what are the actual changes

85
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
that they've encountered?

86
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
What is the process like?

87
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Let's change the order.

88
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Why don't we start with Yuxun?

89
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Okay.

90
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Okay.

91
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Because...

92
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Okay.

93
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
So...

94
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Um...

95
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Let me share my screen.

96
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Okay.

97
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Can you see my screen?

98
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Yes, I can.

99
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
So, basically,

100
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I've already introduced myself

101
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
as a student.

102
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
So, I won't go into details here.

103
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Um...

104
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
I have a passion for science.

105
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
But, um...

106
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
It's like this quote.

107
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I think the world is full of wonderful things

108
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
that you can explore.

109
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
But you need to have enough wisdom

110
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
to discover them.

111
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
This so-called enough wisdom

112
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
is actually my personal interpretation.

113
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
If you want to do anything,

114
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
you have to start over.

115
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
That's right.

116
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
But you have to know how to do it.

117
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
So, why do I say you have to know how to do it?

118
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
At the moment,

119
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
it's very difficult

120
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
to be a researcher.

121
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
If you are passionate about research,

122
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
your first goal must be teaching.

123
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
But, in reality,

124
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm not very determined

125
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
to be a teacher.

126
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
So,

127
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
during my studies,

128
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
apart from

129
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
attending some academic activities,

130
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
I also often attend

131
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
some vocational lectures

132
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
and even some

133
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
vocational talks.

134
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
At the same time,

135
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I also check out

136
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
some talent recruitment websites

137
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
like LinkedIn

138
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
or 104,

139
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
which are often used in Taiwan.

140
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I check out

141
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
the relevant knowledge

142
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
that I've learned

143
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
in the current mainstream companies.

144
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Do they need talents like me?

145
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
If they do,

146
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
what skills do they need?

147
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
So, I occasionally spend some time

148
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
learning from them.

149
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Of course,

150
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
my life went quite well

151
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
as I expected.

152
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
So,

153
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
when it comes to

154
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
interviews in the industry

155
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
or

156
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
working in the industry,

157
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
I can't share too much.

158
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
So,

159
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I'll leave this part

160
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
to the two of you

161
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
to share your experiences.

162
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
So,

163
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
my major is

164
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
nanoradiation

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
or semiconductor radiation.

166
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
So,

167
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
for me,

168
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
if I want to

169
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
become an excellent researcher,

170
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
I must have two identities at the same time.

171
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
One is a good teacher.

172
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Why should I become a good teacher?

173
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Because I must

174
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
take the knowledge

175
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
I've learned

176
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
and pass it on

177
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
to the next

178
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
students

179
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
or those

180
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
who join this field later.

181
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
In addition,

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I must also be

183
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
a good scientist.

184
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
If I become a good scientist,

185
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I can get a privilege

186
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
that I can know

187
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
the secret of the universe

188
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
earlier than others.

189
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Then, I can study it thoroughly

190
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
and try to manipulate

191
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
these physical or scientific phenomena.

192
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I feel excited

193
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
about this.

194
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
So,

195
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
my first goal in life

196
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
is to become a researcher.

197
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
So, I spend most of my energy

198
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
on research.

199
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
My goal in life

200
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
is to create a good

201
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
research environment

202
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
for all excellent students

203
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
to join my lab

204
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
and conduct cutting-edge research.

205
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I want to apply these cutting-edge research

206
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
to the world

207
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
and the human race.

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
In other words,

209
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
I want to benefit the human race.

210
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
It sounds like a lot of nonsense,

211
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
but this is what I thought

212
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
when I was in high school.

213
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
So,

214
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
my personal

215
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
job search is going well

216
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
and I focus on the academic field.

217
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
So, let me make it short.

218
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
When I was a student,

219
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I focused on

220
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
academic development.

221
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
So,

222
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
I focused on

223
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
academic development.

224
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
When I was in the lab,

225
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
I focused on

226
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
receiving awards

227
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,080
such as

228
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
a book award

229
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
or

230
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
a research paper award

231
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
or

232
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
an engineering degree.

233
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
In my field,

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
I joined SPIE

235
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
or IEEE Engineering School.

236
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
There are some student awards

237
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
on the list.

238
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
The advantage of joining these schools

239
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
is that you can

240
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
participate in some academic activities

241
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
and try to apply for some academic awards.

242
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
These academic awards

243
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
will play a very important role

244
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
in your future application

245
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
for a postdoc

246
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Besides the academic activities,

247
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
don't forget that

248
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
as a researcher,

249
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
as a scholar,

250
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
one of your most important missions

251
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
is to pass on knowledge.

252
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
As I mentioned in my last PowerPoint,

253
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
it is very important to pass on knowledge.

254
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
So, during my postdoc

255
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
and my PhD,

256
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I spent some of my energy

257
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
to train some students

258
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
in the Department of University Studies.

259
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Some of the students

260
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
in the Department of University Studies

261
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
received

262
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
some student awards

263
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
at some international conferences.

264
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
These student awards

265
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
are not only their own achievements,

266
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
but also

267
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
my guidance

268
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
to them.

269
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
I can't say it is a guidance,

270
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
but it is also

271
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
a credit for me.

272
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
So, I often hear

273
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
that some students

274
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
spend a lot of time

275
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
on their postdocs

276
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
or postdocs.

277
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
I think

278
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
you need to correct

279
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
your thoughts

280
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
because the students

281
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
who receive these awards

282
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
prove that

283
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
you have the ability

284
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
to lead a team

285
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
and build a team.

286
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
When you write

287
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
the Einstein Project,

288
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
you have the ability

289
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
to build a team.

290
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
So, I think

291
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
both research and teaching

292
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
are very important.

293
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
So, I put some effort

294
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
into both research

295
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
and teaching.

296
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Looking ahead,

297
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
what I have done

298
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
is meaningful.

299
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
These are some of

300
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
my thoughts

301
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
during my PhD.

302
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I am an academic,

303
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
so I can't share

304
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
much about the industry.

305
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
So, I will end

306
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
here.

307
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
I feel like I am wasting your time.

308
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
No problem.

309
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Thank you.

310
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
If you have any questions,

311
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
you can type them

312
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
in the chat.

313
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
We will help you.

314
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
If you

315
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
want to say something,

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
remember to turn on the microphone.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Some people join later.

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Next,

319
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
let's welcome Hao Wei.

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
He is doing a

321
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
calculation on Fitbit.

322
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Hi, everyone.

323
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I am Hao Wei.

324
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Now,

325
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
should I introduce

326
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
my job or

327
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
what I thought

328
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
during my PhD?

329
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
You can start

330
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
now.

331
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
How did you

332
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
decide to

333
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
choose this path?

334
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Did you meet

335
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
any opportunities?

336
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
When I

337
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
started my PhD,

338
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
I was very happy

339
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
when I applied to MIT.

340
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I thought I got a lottery ticket.

341
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
But I didn't know

342
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
how to use it.

343
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
I asked many professors

344
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
what I should do

345
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
to become famous.

346
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
What kind of professors

347
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
should I find?

348
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
A professor told me

349
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
that the research field

350
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
has changed a lot.

351
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
You may not be the most famous

352
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
when you are studying.

353
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
You don't need to pursue it.

354
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
I wanted to continue

355
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
making videos.

356
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
But the professor told me

357
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
I should try new things.

358
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
I went to

359
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
study

360
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
bioengineering.

361
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
I joined

362
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
a lab

363
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
for stem cell

364
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
microfluidics.

365
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
My PhD

366
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
was a struggle.

367
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I had to learn

368
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
new things

369
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
that I wasn't familiar with.

370
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
I started to raise cells,

371
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
kill mice,

372
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
and other things

373
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
that I wasn't familiar with.

374
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
During my PhD,

375
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I learned

376
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
about cross-field research.

377
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
I learned

378
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
how to respect professionals

379
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
and how to learn

380
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
what they are good at.

381
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
In our lab,

382
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
there are chemical engineers,

383
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
biologists, mechanical engineers,

384
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
electrical engineers,

385
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
and scientists.

386
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Everyone is different.

387
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
How can you

388
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
understand what others are doing?

389
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Sometimes you can even

390
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
talk to them.

391
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
During my PhD,

392
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
I was happy

393
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
to learn

394
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
different things.

395
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
During my PhD,

396
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
there was a postdoc

397
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
in our lab.

398
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
He just started

399
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
his PhD.

400
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
He did research there.

401
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
I thought

402
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
this company was interesting.

403
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
He thought I was suitable

404
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
for that company,

405
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
so I became an intern.

406
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
If you are not sure

407
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
whether you want to

408
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
become a student or an intern,

409
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
if you have a chance

410
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
to explore different opportunities,

411
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
it's different to

412
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
become an intern.

413
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
You get to know the industry.

414
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
After you graduate,

415
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
your chance to work

416
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
in the industry

417
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
will increase.

418
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
We were lucky

419
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
to be an intern

420
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
for three months.

421
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
It was fun.

422
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
After I graduated,

423
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
I went back to the company.

424
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
As for

425
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
what I am

426
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
doing now,

427
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
there are

428
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
many people

429
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
from different fields

430
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
in our company.

431
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
We have sleep technologists,

432
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
exercise physiologists,

433
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
mechanical and electrical

434
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
engineers.

435
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
What I am doing now

436
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
is a team lead.

437
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
I handle a big project

438
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
and finish it together.

439
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Yes.

440
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
I have a question.

441
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Where should

442
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
a student

443
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
choose to study?

444
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Or,

445
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
where should

446
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
a student choose

447
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
to study?

448
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
For example,

449
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
what is the relationship

450
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
between the teacher

451
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
and the community

452
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
in the industry?

453
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
As far as I know,

454
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
biotechnology

455
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
is very popular

456
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
in Boston.

457
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
That's right.

458
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
I think it's important.

459
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
If you want to

460
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
work in the industry,

461
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
go to a place with

462
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
many companies,

463
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
you can easily

464
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
get to know

465
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
what life is like

466
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
in different companies.

467
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
In Boston,

468
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
we have

469
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
a BTBA organization.

470
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
We are all Taiwanese

471
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
and have a BTBA association.

472
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Many people

473
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
work there.

474
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
We have an annual conference

475
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
to share what we are doing.

476
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
I think it's important

477
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
to choose a place.

478
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
If you are a professor,

479
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
you can ask

480
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
other professors

481
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
or people

482
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
in the lab,

483
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
even foreigners,

484
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
to grab a coffee

485
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
and chat

486
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
about their

487
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
views.

488
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Thank you.

489
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Let me see if there are any questions.

490
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Let's finish

491
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
our talk.

492
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
We have a question

493
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
for Yuxun.

494
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Let's hear from

495
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Mujie.

496
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Okay.

497
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
I'm like Yuxun.

498
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
When I was young,

499
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
I wanted to

500
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
become a scientist.

501
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
I didn't know

502
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
what I wanted to do.

503
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
I decided to study chemistry

504
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
when I was in high school.

505
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
At that time,

506
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
I found chemistry interesting.

507
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
So I chose chemistry.

508
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
I kept studying.

509
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
I was different from

510
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
most people.

511
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
I decided to study

512
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
in the Netherlands.

513
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Most people

514
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
went to the U.S. or the U.K.

515
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Before I went abroad,

516
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
I asked

517
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
my teacher

518
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
if I wanted to

519
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
go back to Taiwan

520
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
to be a professor.

521
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
If I went to the Netherlands,

522
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
would it affect me?

523
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
If you google the name of the university,

524
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
it's not

525
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
the top university in the world.

526
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
My boss told me

527
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
that if you really

528
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
want to get a job,

529
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
your name is not that important.

530
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
What's important is

531
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
what you got

532
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
in the course of studying.

533
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Did you prepare yourself well?

534
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
It's like

535
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
what you said earlier.

536
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
You need to know

537
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
where you want to go

538
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
and

539
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
prepare yourself well.

540
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
So I went to the Netherlands

541
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
to study.

542
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
When I was in the Netherlands,

543
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
it was interesting.

544
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
You mentioned

545
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
joining a lab.

546
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
It was a new lab.

547
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
I was the first

548
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
PhD student

549
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
of my boss.

550
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
I learned

551
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
how to build up

552
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
your lab

553
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
from a young faculty.

554
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
After I graduated

555
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
from my PhD,

556
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
I joined a new lab

557
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
and was the first

558
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
PhD student of my boss.

559
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
I didn't choose

560
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
these places on purpose.

561
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Of course,

562
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
I had some considerations.

563
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
I think you need to

564
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
pay attention to your personality.

565
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
You like to stay in the city

566
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
or go to

567
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
university-like places.

568
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
I think this

569
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
will affect

570
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
your daily life.

571
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
I like to go to

572
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
less crowded places.

573
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
So I chose these places.

574
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Although Chicago

575
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
is a big city,

576
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
it's a bit helpless

577
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
because as a

578
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
PhD student in Europe,

579
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
it's relatively difficult

580
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
to find a postdoc in the US.

581
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Your boss doesn't help you much

582
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
because he only knows people in Europe.

583
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
He rarely knows people in the US.

584
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
At that time,

585
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
I flew from

586
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Europe and the Netherlands

587
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
to the US for conferences

588
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
to meet some young

589
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
PIs.

590
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
I took a few interviews

591
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
and went to

592
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
those PIs.

593
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
He mentioned that

594
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
he had a position

595
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
and I went to

596
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
talk to him.

597
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Although I didn't

598
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
talk to him,

599
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
it's because of

600
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
other financial reasons.

601
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
I think

602
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
sometimes

603
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
you don't have

604
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
many choices.

605
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
So you have to

606
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
be prepared.

607
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
If it's not your first choice,

608
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
what will be your second

609
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
or third choice?

610
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
This is

611
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
my overall

612
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
opinion.

613
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Let's see if

614
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
there's anything else you want to know.

615
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Thank you, Mu Jie.

616
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
We actually have a lot of questions

617
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
and the questions came out

618
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
faster than we can digest.

619
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Some of them

620
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
are about

621
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
things to discuss later.

622
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Let's ask a question first.

623
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
Chen Yixuan

624
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
wants to ask Yuxun.

625
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
During your Ph.D.

626
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
and looking for a job,

627
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
did you ever want to give up or

628
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
change your career?

629
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
How did you

630
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
change your mind?

631
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Of course.

632
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
This can be divided into

633
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
two parts.

634
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
One is an internal question

635
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
and the other is an external question.

636
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
The internal question is

637
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
when I was in my

638
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
fourth year of Ph.D.,

639
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
I had my own paper.

640
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Before that, I didn't even have

641
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
a second author's paper.

642
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
In the process,

643
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
I thought

644
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
if I was not

645
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
suitable for

646
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
academia.

647
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
In academia,

648
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
you need to have enough research

649
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
to be able to

650
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
continue.

651
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
This is the internal part.

652
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
The external part is

653
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
when I was in my

654
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
fourth year of Ph.D.,

655
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
I went to work

656
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
at a tai chi shop.

657
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Although I

658
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
saw them complaining about

659
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
their busy schedule,

660
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
I saw them buy a car,

661
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
buy a house, get married,

662
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
and have kids.

663
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Even my high school

664
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
graduates

665
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
bought a car

666
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
and bought a house

667
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
and had kids.

668
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
I wondered

669
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
if I was mentally ill

670
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
and wanted to take this path.

671
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Of course, there were times

672
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
when I wanted to give up.

673
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Every time

674
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
I wanted to give up,

675
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
I wanted to try again.

676
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Your life is only once.

677
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
If you don't try,

678
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
if you don't push your limits,

679
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
you will never know

680
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
how far you can go.

681
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
I was trying

682
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
as much as I could.

683
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
On the other hand,

684
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
I am very grateful

685
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
to my family and friends

686
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
for their help.

687
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
I don't have any financial

688
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
difficulties.

689
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
To be honest,

690
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
I don't have any financial difficulties.

691
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Compared to other Ph.D. students

692
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
I know,

693
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
I am relatively lucky.

694
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
I am lucky

695
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
because

696
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
I know some people

697
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
who are not so lucky.

698
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
They've made it

699
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
and survived.

700
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
It's a great motivation

701
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
to me.

702
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
They've made it

703
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
and survived.

704
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
It's a great motivation

705
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
to me.

706
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
It's a great motivation

707
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
to me.

708
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
So I will spend

709
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
my days

710
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
thinking about

711
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
these three things.

712
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,440
I will hang out

713
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
with my friends

714
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
and chat a lot,

715
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
or take a walk

716
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
and listen to

717
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
other people's stories

718
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
in lectures.

719
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
I even go to

720
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
bookstores

721
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
to see how

722
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
some of the

723
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
drugs are good

724
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
depending on how you use them.

725
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Sometimes you need

726
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
positive energy

727
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
to support you.

728
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
This is my answer to this question.

729
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Very positive.

730
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Thank you.

731
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Our next question

732
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
is related to

733
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
some of the questions

734
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
that have been raised.

735
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
For example,

736
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
if you want to go to the industry

737
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
but have not done an internship,

738
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
do you need to do postdocs

739
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
before going to the industry?

740
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Another question is

741
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
if you have studied for many years

742
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
and want to transition to

743
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
the industry,

744
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
will there be a deduction?

745
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Our next question

746
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
is to ask

747
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
how the academic research

748
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
can help you

749
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
and the advantages and disadvantages.

750
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Can you give us a general analysis?

751
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Let's sum up these questions

752
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
and let Haowei answer them.

753
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Okay, no problem.

754
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
I think

755
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
the first question

756
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
is

757
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
whether you need to

758
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
do postdocs

759
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
before going to work.

760
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Postdocs is a time for relaxation.

761
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
If you want to go to the industry,

762
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
you can find a new city

763
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
or an interesting topic.

764
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
That topic is very needed

765
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
in the industry now.

766
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
It is a good opportunity

767
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
to be a jump board.

768
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
If not, it's okay.

769
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
If you have not done postdocs,

770
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
if you can find

771
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
a similar job,

772
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
it's good.

773
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
But in fact,

774
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
if you want to apply

775
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
what you learned in PhD

776
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
to the industry,

777
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
for me,

778
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
what I learned

779
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
in PhD is

780
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
soft skills.

781
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
How to make a presentation,

782
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
how to

783
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
do a literature search,

784
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
how to

785
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
present your idea to others.

786
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
I think these soft skills

787
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
are more important.

788
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
As for

789
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
hard skills,

790
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
it depends on

791
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
whether there are elements

792
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
in the topic of PhD.

793
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
For example,

794
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
you can talk to your friends

795
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
in the industry

796
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
about which skills

797
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
the industry needs.

798
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
When the industry is looking for talents,

799
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
it depends on your experience

800
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
and your skill set.

801
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
There are two ways

802
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
when the industry is looking for talents.

803
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
One is fresh grad.

804
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
I take you in and train you again.

805
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
It depends on

806
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
your experience.

807
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
It depends on your luck.

808
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
Any other questions?

809
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm curious about

810
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
a similar question.

811
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
When did you

812
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
start to want to work in the industry?

813
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Did you do the internship

814
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
because you wanted to work in the industry?

815
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Did you decide

816
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
to go this way

817
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
after the internship?

818
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Or did you decide

819
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
to go this way

820
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
after the internship?

821
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
I'm more interested

822
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
in the industry.

823
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
First,

824
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
I don't like to write papers.

825
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
I think

826
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
it's a waste of time

827
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
to write papers.

828
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
I want to do something

829
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
that makes me feel

830
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
accomplished.

831
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I started to work in the industry

832
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
in my third or fourth year.

833
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
After I saw

834
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
the algorithm,

835
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
millions of people

836
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
were using it.

837
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
I felt accomplished.

838
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Any other questions?

839
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Besides

840
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
hiring people in the industry,

841
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
are you interested in

842
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
starting your own business

843
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
or starting a new company?

844
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
In Boston,

845
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
the start-up culture

846
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
is very strong.

847
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm a member

848
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
of the Yushan Technology Association.

849
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
We advocate

850
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
start-ups

851
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
and resources

852
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
to hold events

853
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
to add these things.

854
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
We have investors

855
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
who fund us.

856
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
We have entrepreneurs

857
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
who have started a business.

858
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
We have local

859
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
technology scientists.

860
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
We have these resources.

861
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
We hold events every year

862
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
to see if we can create something new.

863
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I have a friend

864
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
who is a doctor.

865
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
He also started a company

866
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
in Taiwan.

867
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
He does AI and healthcare.

868
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
I might

869
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
be interested in

870
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
starting a start-up company

871
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
after a while.

872
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
I might give it a try.

873
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
You may not know.

874
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
I just asked this question.

875
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Hao Wei

876
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
is very active

877
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
in Taiwan's industry

878
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
and start-up organizations

879
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
and clubs.

880
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
If you have any questions,

881
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
you can contact him

882
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
to discuss or collaborate.

883
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Can you hear me?

884
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes.

885
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
I'm Yiting.

886
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Yanyong asked a lot of questions.

887
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Can I go back

888
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
and ask more?

889
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Sure.

890
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
He asked

891
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
if you need to

892
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
be a postdoc.

893
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
He also asked

894
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
if you want to

895
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
become an intern

896
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
after completing

897
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
a PhD.

898
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
He also asked

899
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
if you want to

900
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
become a postdoc

901
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
after completing

902
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
a PhD.

903
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
I'm curious.

904
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Can you share

905
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
your thoughts?

906
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Hi.

907
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
This question

908
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
is very specific.

909
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
It's easy to find a job

910
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
in electronics.

911
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
But it's not easy

912
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
to find a job

913
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
in bio.

914
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Most people

915
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
can't find a job

916
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
after completing

917
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
a postdoc.

918
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
I think

919
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
it's important

920
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
to ask people

921
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
in the same field

922
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
how to use

923
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
their skills

924
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
in the industry.

925
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Thank you.

926
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Yiting is in Europe, right?

927
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
Yes.

928
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
I'm in Switzerland.

929
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
You're a world-famous person.

930
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Yes.

931
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Today is a special day.

932
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
It's not a regular day.

933
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
I can participate.

934
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
We're usually

935
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
in North America.

936
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
It's a suitable day for us.

937
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
But it's a world-famous day.

938
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Okay.

939
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Mu Jie

940
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
said something

941
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
interesting.

942
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Let me ask you.

943
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
I think Mu Jie

944
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
is an expert

945
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
who works with young professors.

946
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
He works with young professors

947
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
at every stage.

948
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
He's a young boss now.

949
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Can you share

950
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
with us

951
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
if you're worried

952
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
that it's hard

953
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
to find a job

954
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
with a young boss

955
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
or a boss

956
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
who's not

957
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
as good as Mu Jie?

958
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Do you have any

959
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
suggestions

960
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
for young people

961
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
who want to work with young bosses?

962
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
I think

963
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
it's very risky

964
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
to work with young bosses.

965
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
You don't know

966
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
their past records.

967
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
You can only check

968
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
their past publications.

969
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
It's risky.

970
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
But

971
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
another advantage of young professors

972
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
is that

973
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
you can be sure

974
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
they won't fail.

975
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
After all,

976
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
they're under pressure.

977
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
So you can be sure

978
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
they won't fail.

979
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
If you meet a young boss

980
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
who's not as good as you,

981
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
you can

982
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
leave

983
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
after a few years.

984
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Because

985
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
even if

986
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
your boss is very influential,

987
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
to a certain extent,

988
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
if he's

989
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
very influential

990
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
and helps you

991
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
make progress,

992
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
to a certain extent,

993
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
you'll be influenced by him.

994
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
If he's a good boss,

995
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
I don't think it's a problem.

996
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
If he's not a good boss,

997
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
he might help you

998
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
find a job.

999
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
He might start to tell you

1000
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
or suggest you

1001
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
that he helped you

1002
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
and you should help him.

1003
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
It's hard to say no.

1004
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Another idea

1005
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
is to

1006
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
take a risk with them.

1007
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
It's a high-risk, high-reward.

1008
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
I had this idea

1009
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
when I was young.

1010
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
You work with young professors.

1011
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
When they become famous,

1012
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
you're still a student.

1013
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
When they become influential,

1014
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
you're still a student.

1015
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
But if you work with an old professor,

1016
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
who will help you after he's gone?

1017
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
It's a similar idea.

1018
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
So I think

1019
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
young professors

1020
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
are at risk.

1021
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
When I was making these choices,

1022
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
I interviewed

1023
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
those bosses.

1024
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
You have to talk to them.

1025
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
You have to know

1026
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
what they expect you to do.

1027
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
I think

1028
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
it was special at the beginning.

1029
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
In the Netherlands,

1030
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
you interview

1031
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
the boss.

1032
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
He'll give you

1033
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
a clear question

1034
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
about what you should do.

1035
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Before I left,

1036
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
I knew

1037
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
what kind of personality

1038
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
my future boss would have

1039
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
and what kind of question

1040
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
I should ask.

1041
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
So I knew

1042
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
I could start working

1043
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
right away.

1044
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
As for POSA,

1045
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
I thought

1046
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
I could get along

1047
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
with them.

1048
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
So

1049
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
I decided

1050
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
to go to POSA.

1051
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Another reason

1052
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
I went to POSA

1053
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
is that

1054
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I didn't want to

1055
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
wait too long

1056
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
to get a job there.

1057
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
So that was

1058
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
the only offer I had.

1059
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
I asked

1060
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
my college classmate

1061
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
in the US.

1062
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
I asked him

1063
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
how to get a job at POSA.

1064
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
He said young professors

1065
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
usually have those positions.

1066
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Young professors

1067
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
just got here,

1068
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
so they must have

1069
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
a few POSA positions.

1070
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
So they must have them.

1071
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
If you go to

1072
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
well-known labs,

1073
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
they can't help you.

1074
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
They might have a POSA position,

1075
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
but half a year ago,

1076
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
it was booked.

1077
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
So you can't find it.

1078
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
So you have to

1079
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
beg for a POSA.

1080
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
So I think

1081
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
it's not the same.

1082
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
The most important thing is

1083
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
to select your boss.

1084
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
At least talk to him.

1085
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Don't just follow him.

1086
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
Then decide

1087
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
the next few days.

1088
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Another important thing

1089
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
is if you don't think

1090
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
it's suitable,

1091
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
leave early.

1092
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
Be brave and say no.

1093
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Give up earlier

1094
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
is better than

1095
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
giving up later.

1096
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Because

1097
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
when you get to

1098
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
the level of POSA,

1099
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
at least some people

1100
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
have families

1101
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
or a stable partner.

1102
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
If you're not

1103
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
in a good mood,

1104
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
it will affect more people,

1105
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
not just you.

1106
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
So that's about it.

1107
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Okay.

1108
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
Did anyone

1109
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
want to ask a question?

1110
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Do you want to apply for a doctorate in the Netherlands?

1111
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Yes. Let's expand

1112
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
this question.

1113
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Why did you want to apply?

1114
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,440
For example, the Netherlands.

1115
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Did you only apply for the Netherlands?

1116
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Or did you apply to other European countries?

1117
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
At that time,

1118
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
the situation was like this.

1119
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
The application in the Netherlands was different.

1120
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
It's not like the United States or Taiwan.

1121
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
You have to apply at a fixed time every year.

1122
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Because every year,

1123
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
you have to submit something

1124
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
The doctor in the Netherlands

1125
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
is very similar to what I just said.

1126
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
Because it's a very specific topic.

1127
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
So it's actually the boss's

1128
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
application plan.

1129
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Then he will get a doctorate position.

1130
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
When he gets this doctorate position,

1131
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
he will advertise it.

1132
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
So basically, you can apply all year round.

1133
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
The point is whether the boss has received the money or not.

1134
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
So he can apply all year round.

1135
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
So he has

1136
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
a lot of free time.

1137
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
At that time,

1138
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
I was preparing for the application in the United States.

1139
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
But it just so happens that

1140
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
there was a student in our department

1141
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
who was studying for a doctorate in the Netherlands.

1142
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
He said that there was a new teacher

1143
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
in their school and there were several positions.

1144
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Then I saw the topic and thought it was quite interesting.

1145
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,440
So I made an appointment with the teacher.

1146
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
This interview was actually before

1147
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
I sent out the application in the United States.

1148
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
After the interview,

1149
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
the boss

1150
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
was willing to give me a position.

1151
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
So I didn't apply to the United States at the end.

1152
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,440
Oh, you didn't apply at all?

1153
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
I had everything ready.

1154
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
I was actually going to send it out.

1155
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,440
Because I told him that

1156
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
I asked him when he would give me a reply.

1157
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Then he gave me a time.

1158
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Because I told him that if he gave me a reply,

1159
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
I would go if he was willing to.

1160
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Then I would stop all the applications in the United States.

1161
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,440
So I was willing to do this at that time.

1162
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,440
Just go.

1163
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,440
So if you want to apply for a doctorate in Europe,

1164
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
most of the time

1165
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
you have to take the initiative to look at

1166
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
all the teachers' websites

1167
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
or all the schools'

1168
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,440
HR websites.

1169
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,440
Then there will be some positions on it.

1170
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Yes.

1171
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,440
So like this,

1172
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
because you have a classmate

1173
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,440
or a junior who knows this information,

1174
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
but you just said

1175
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
most of them will directly post

1176
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
information like this

1177
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
talent or real person.

1178
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
Is it the same as

1179
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
applying for a doctorate

1180
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,440
in the Netherlands?

1181
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
Or where can you find this information?

1182
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
At least I'm sure it's on the same platform

1183
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
in the Netherlands.

1184
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
Because it's really

1185
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
like going to a company to find a job.

1186
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
It's a bit like

1187
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
going to a company's

1188
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,440
website's HR section.

1189
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Then it will list all the positions.

1190
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
So it will list

1191
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,440
that it may have a faculty position

1192
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,440
or a Ph.D. position.

1193
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,440
So it's actually found here.

1194
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,440
I forgot to mention that

1195
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
the reason why I chose the Netherlands

1196
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
is because when I was in the university,

1197
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
my teacher

1198
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
asked me to go to the Netherlands

1199
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
for a meeting.

1200
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
So I went there for some exchange activities.

1201
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
I had a good impression of the Netherlands.

1202
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
So I decided to go to the Netherlands.

1203
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Someone asked

1204
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
how competitive it was.

1205
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Actually, it was very competitive.

1206
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Yes, it was really competitive.

1207
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Yes, but I think

1208
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,440
actually...

1209
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,440
I'm sorry.

1210
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Actually, finding a faculty position

1211
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
is...

1212
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
I think people often have a misunderstanding.

1213
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
It's like someone is very good

1214
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
but he didn't get a faculty position.

1215
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
I think this is very strange.

1216
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
But actually it's not like that.

1217
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,440
The reason is

1218
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
you have to look at

1219
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,440
what kind of person

1220
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
your target department

1221
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,440
is.

1222
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,440
For example, in the field of chemistry,

1223
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,440
I'm just saying.

1224
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
It's not that our department is looking for it now.

1225
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
Let's say our department wants to find

1226
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,440
an organic chemistry person.

1227
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,440
You apply for a person

1228
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,440
who is super good at physics and chemistry.

1229
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,440
Basically, his chances are very small.

1230
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
Yes, the reason is

1231
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,440
that we don't have that shortage

1232
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
in physics and chemistry now.

1233
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,440
Because I often find faculty

1234
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,440
to satisfy

1235
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,440
their expectations

1236
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
for teaching in the future.

1237
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
Yes, so I think

1238
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
don't be too self-absorbed.

1239
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Why do you think the person

1240
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
who applied is worse than me?

1241
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Why can he still go?

1242
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,440
But it's mainly

1243
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
because of this reason.

1244
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
Especially if you are

1245
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
going to a more advanced school.

1246
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,440
Yes, and sometimes

1247
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
because

1248
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,440
the direction you are going

1249
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,440
is that there is a young teacher

1250
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,440
or there are already a lot of people

1251
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,440
doing this direction,

1252
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,440
so you can't get into that department.

1253
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,440
Yes, so it's often...

1254
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,440
So part of the competition

1255
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,440
is actually here.

1256
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,440
And this is actually

1257
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
a place you can't control yourself.

1258
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,440
So I often say that

1259
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
sometimes when you are looking for a teacher,

1260
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,440
you actually need to ask

1261
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,440
your former teacher

1262
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,440
about it,

1263
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,440
which direction this time

1264
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
he wants to go.

1265
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,440
Yes, so that's probably it.

1266
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,440
In fact,

1267
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,440
if you want to lose postdoc,

1268
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
no, sorry, you want to lose the faculty position,

1269
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
this department

1270
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,440
has a very important

1271
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
future plan for its own research.

1272
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,440
But how high do you think the opportunity is

1273
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,440
that you can use

1274
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
what you are good at to break it?

1275
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,440
For example, they wanted to find a light school,

1276
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,440
but you are, for example,

1277
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,440
super strong, so strong that you can

1278
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
make them rather give up or

1279
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,440
re-adjust their future plan.

1280
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,440
Or is this basically impossible to happen?

1281
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,440
This is definitely possible to happen.

1282
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
This is definitely possible to happen.

1283
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,440
Because if you go to a

1284
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
research-focused school,

1285
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,440
the chance of this happening will be higher.

1286
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,440
Yes, but it will become

1287
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
an extra person

1288
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,440
to help you.

1289
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,440
Yes, but

1290
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,440
another problem is that

1291
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,440
in Taiwan, faculty positions

1292
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,440
are actually limited.

1293
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
So if you happen to

1294
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,440
meet a faculty today,

1295
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,440
there is only one person left.

1296
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Then the difficulty will increase a lot.

1297
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Because after he hired you,

1298
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
even if you are very good,

1299
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
what about the gap in teaching

1300
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
in the next two years?

1301
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
So there will be this.

1302
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,440
There may also be such a situation.

1303
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440
So like I said,

1304
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,440
it's actually very important to find

1305
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,440
someone who can help you.

1306
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
Because they will also know

1307
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,440
if there is a way to

1308
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
argue with the school for some positions.

1309
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,440
Because in fact, these can all be discussed.

1310
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,440
How good you are actually depends on

1311
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
how much the department is willing to help you.

1312
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,440
Yes, if you are really super strong.

1313
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,440
Suppose you are

1314
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,440
in Caltech today and

1315
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,440
you are an assistant professor

1316
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,440
and you are willing to come back to Taiwan.

1317
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,440
Then I think the space that will be willing to help you

1318
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,440
is already much bigger.

1319
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,440
This will definitely be a big news.

1320
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,440
But this is just an exaggerated example.

1321
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
But what I mean is that

1322
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
the more powerful you are,

1323
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,440
the more willing to help you.

1324
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,440
So even if you find out

1325
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,440
that it is not your own field,

1326
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
but you will still encourage you to apply.

1327
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,440
You just don't have to

1328
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,440
do it because you have it or not.

1329
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Yes, yes, yes.

1330
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
OK, now that we have talked about

1331
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,440
looking for this job,

1332
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
this academia job.

1333
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
In fact, we have arranged

1334
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
a very good video

1335
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,440
prepared by Yuxun.

1336
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,440
You can tell us about

1337
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
his application,

1338
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
such as Price Postdoc Fellowship

1339
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
and independent research funding.

1340
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,440
They all applied for this

1341
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
Einstein project.

1342
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
Otherwise, let's invite Yuxun

1343
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,440
to share his video now.

1344
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,440
OK, no problem.

1345
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,440
Can you see it now?

1346
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,440
I just saw it,

1347
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,440
but I can't see it now.

1348
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,440
Can you see it now?

1349
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Yes, yes.

1350
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,440
OK,

1351
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,440
because of the limited time,

1352
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,440
I will directly cut to the point.

1353
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,440
OK, so here you can see

1354
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,440
the review key points

1355
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,440
of the Einstein project.

1356
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,440
It includes the applicant's

1357
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,440
ambition,

1358
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,440
and then your research

1359
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,440
topic,

1360
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
how important it is to society,

1361
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440
what kind of contribution it makes to society,

1362
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,440
and how to train the research team.

1363
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,440
The Columbus project is basically

1364
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,440
the same as the Einstein project.

1365
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
It just has one more

1366
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,440
international cooperation experience

1367
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,440
and an important plan

1368
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,440
to serve the International Academy of Sciences.

1369
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,440
So let's talk about

1370
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,440
it one by one.

1371
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,440
When you apply for this project,

1372
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,440
what kind of preparation

1373
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
do you need to do?

1374
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
Hello.

1375
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
OK, so basically

1376
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
the above review key points

1377
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,440
are a bit confusing, right?

1378
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,440
First of all,

1379
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
the most important thing

1380
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,440
is your

1381
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
first item.

1382
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
The first item is to ask

1383
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,440
the applicant

1384
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
how important

1385
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
the project is

1386
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
and how long

1387
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,440
it will last.

1388
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,440
So you have to

1389
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,440
try to describe

1390
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,440
how important

1391
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
and how long

1392
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,440
your project is

1393
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,440
in your plan.

1394
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,440
Because the plan review

1395
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
is one of the review opinions

1396
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,440
that applicants often encounter.

1397
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,440
But the applicant is not an expert

1398
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,440
in this area.

1399
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,440
So when you write

1400
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,440
the background of the study,

1401
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,440
you have to focus on

1402
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,440
some key points.

1403
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,440
For example,

1404
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,440
how to get the reviewer

1405
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,440
to catch

1406
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,440
your point

1407
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,440
quickly.

1408
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
So

1409
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,440
I think

1410
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,440
there is a very good

1411
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
way to get

1412
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
the reviewer to catch

1413
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,440
your point

1414
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
quickly.

1415
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,440
You can ask

1416
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,440
some friends

1417
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,440
who are not in the field

1418
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,440
to introduce

1419
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,440
the background of

1420
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,440
your study.

1421
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
Because they are not in the field,

1422
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,440
they will know

1423
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,440
where the blind spot is.

1424
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
They will tell you

1425
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,440
when you apply,

1426
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
they will tell you

1427
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,440
your study is

1428
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,440
application type,

1429
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,440
orientation type,

1430
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,440
or basic research type.

1431
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,440
These are the three types.

1432
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,440
So when you apply,

1433
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,440
if you are

1434
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,440
basic research type,

1435
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,440
it's basically like this picture.

1436
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,440
The person on your right

1437
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
wants to cross the river to the other side.

1438
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,440
For a mathematician,

1439
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,440
if you are a smart mathematician,

1440
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,440
you basically

1441
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,440
shrink the whole two-dimensional plane

1442
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,440
into a point.

1443
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,440
You fold it over,

1444
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,440
and the person can jump over the river.

1445
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
So this is called theoretical research.

1446
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,440
In other words,

1447
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
it has nothing to do with application.

1448
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
It is a more basic research.

1449
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,440
For example,

1450
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,440
if you want to study

1451
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
in another field,

1452
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,440
if you want to study

1453
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
where the gap is between

1454
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,440
basic research and

1455
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,440
basic research,

1456
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,440
it may not be able to

1457
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,440
apply immediately.

1458
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,440
What is application type research?

1459
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,440
Basically,

1460
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,440
what kind of problem do you want to overcome

1461
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,440
if you want to cross the river?

1462
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,440
How do you build a bridge?

1463
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,440
If you build a bridge,

1464
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,440
what kind of earthquake

1465
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,440
can it withstand?

1466
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,440
This is called application type research.

1467
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,440
Based on application type

1468
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
and basic research,

1469
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,440
it is basically like this picture.

1470
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,440
You feel like there is something

1471
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
that can be done,

1472
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,440
but it is not so practical.

1473
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,440
You are not sure

1474
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,440
if it is really possible in the future.

1475
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,440
But it seems to be able to do it

1476
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,440
and seems to be applicable.

1477
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,440
This thing is called

1478
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
orientation type research.

1479
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,440
So whether it is orientation type research,

1480
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,440
basic research,

1481
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,440
or application type research,

1482
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,440
you can first explain

1483
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
the importance of your problem.

1484
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,440
For example,

1485
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,440
why do people cross the river?

1486
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,440
How difficult is it to cross the river?

1487
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,440
After crossing the river,

1488
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
what can you do to help

1489
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,440
these people?

1490
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,440
If you change to

1491
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,440
a practical case,

1492
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
you have to explain

1493
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
the relevance of your research

1494
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
to Taiwan.

1495
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,440
What can you do to help Taiwan?

1496
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
For example,

1497
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
after solving this problem,

1498
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,440
how much can you improve

1499
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Taiwan's academic status?

1500
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,440
You can write a KPI.

1501
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
You can find a way

1502
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,440
to give a qualitative

1503
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,440
or quantitative value

1504
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
to let the reviewer know

1505
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
how much help

1506
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
your research will have

1507
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,440
in the future.

1508
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,440
In other words,

1509
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,440
where is your contribution?

1510
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,440
If you are applying type research,

1511
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,440
you have to find a way

1512
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,440
to write how much value

1513
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,440
you can contribute.

1514
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,440
What kind of talents

1515
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,440
can you cultivate in your plan?

1516
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,440
What kind of help

1517
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,440
can these talents

1518
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
bring to Taiwan's industry

1519
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
or Taiwan's academics?

1520
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,440
So try to use

1521
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,440
some slogans

1522
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,440
in your plan.

1523
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
Don't write too much.

1524
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,440
You have to be specific

1525
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,440
about what you want to do.

1526
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,440
You have to be specific

1527
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,440
about what you want to do.

1528
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,440
This is more acceptable

1529
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,440
to the reviewer.

1530
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,440
This is more acceptable

1531
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,440
to the reviewer.

1532
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,440
I applied for the Einstein Project

1533
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,440
twice.

1534
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,440
The first time,

1535
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
I didn't write too much.

1536
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,440
The second time,

1537
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
I didn't write too much.

1538
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,440
The third time,

1539
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,440
I didn't write too much.

1540
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,440
The fourth time,

1541
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,440
I didn't write too much.

1542
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,440
I just wrote down

1543
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,440
what kind of talent

1544
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,440
I want to cultivate

1545
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,440
and what kind of value

1546
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
I can contribute.

1547
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,440
I just wrote down

1548
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,440
what kind of talent

1549
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,440
I want to cultivate

1550
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,440
and what kind of value

1551
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,440
I can contribute.

1552
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,440
I just wrote down

1553
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,440
what kind of talent

1554
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
I want to cultivate

1555
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,440
and what kind of value

1556
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
I can contribute.

1557
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,440
So tell me

1558
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,440
what kind of talent

1559
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,440
you want to cultivate

1560
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,440
and what kind of value

1561
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
I can contribute.

1562
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,440
So tell me

1563
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,440
what kind of talent

1564
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,440
you want to cultivate

1565
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
and what kind of value

1566
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,440
I can contribute.

1567
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,440
Your plan will reflect

1568
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,440
your ambition and vision.

1569
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,440
So it's important to create a vision.

1570
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,440
In this picture,

1571
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,440
I just showed you

1572
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,440
what I said in my self-introduction.

1573
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,440
Let me say it again.

1574
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,440
The so-called vision is very important.

1575
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,440
What kind of dream

1576
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,440
do you want to achieve

1577
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,440
through this plan?

1578
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,440
For example, you are a doctor.

1579
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,440
You want to cure cancer

1580
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,440
and save all humans.

1581
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,440
It sounds very ambitious.

1582
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,440
It sounds very ambitious.

1583
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,440
But in fact, this plan

1584
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,440
hopes that you have

1585
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,440
such an ambition.

1586
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,440
It also hopes that you can

1587
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,440
challenge what others can't.

1588
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,440
So don't think

1589
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,440
what you wrote

1590
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,440
is unlikely to happen.

1591
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,440
As long as you think

1592
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,440
your idea is good

1593
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,440
and helpful to humans,

1594
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,440
and you are confident

1595
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,440
that you can make it happen,

1596
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,440
you should write this plan.

1597
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,440
Why did I say that?

1598
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,440
It's because

1599
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,440
when my sister applied

1600
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,440
for a college in the U.S.,

1601
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,440
she thought

1602
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,440
she wasn't good enough

1603
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,440
to apply for a good school.

1604
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,440
So she asked

1605
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,440
her school's consultant.

1606
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,440
The consultant told her

1607
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,440
whether she was good enough

1608
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,440
wasn't up to her.

1609
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,440
It's the job of the consultant.

1610
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,440
So she encouraged her sister

1611
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,440
to apply for a good school.

1612
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,440
Don't give up

1613
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,440
because you think you can't do it.

1614
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,440
I want to tell you

1615
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,440
don't give up

1616
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,440
because you think

1617
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,440
your plan is not good enough.

1618
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,440
It's up to the consultant

1619
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,440
to decide

1620
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,440
whether you are good enough

1621
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,440
or not.

1622
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,440
Don't give up any chance.

1623
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,440
Let's go back to

1624
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,440
the application process

1625
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,440
and the past performance.

1626
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,440
Now,

1627
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,440
I'm going to talk about

1628
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,440
the past research performance.

1629
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
The past research performance

1630
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,440
is about

1631
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,440
what papers

1632
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,440
you submitted

1633
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,440
in the past research.

1634
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,440
Of course, this is a superficial idea.

1635
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,440
You need to look at

1636
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,440
your research

1637
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,440
in the past research.

1638
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,440
Why is your research important?

1639
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,440
So,

1640
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,440
I'm going to echo

1641
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,440
what I just said.

1642
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,440
Your past research

1643
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,440
gave the

1644
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,440
reviewer

1645
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,440
a direction.

1646
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,440
Through your past research performance,

1647
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,440
you got some credits.

1648
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,440
These credits

1649
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,440
make the reviewer believe

1650
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,440
you can do it in the future.

1651
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,440
So,

1652
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,440
when you are writing a research plan,

1653
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,440
you need to

1654
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,440
have a background

1655
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,440
to explain

1656
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,440
your experience

1657
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,440
in solving

1658
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,440
this problem.

1659
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,440
What international teams

1660
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,440
did you work with

1661
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,440
in the past research?

1662
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,440
What important journals

1663
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,440
did you publish

1664
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,440
in the past research?

1665
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,440
How many credits

1666
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,440
did you get in the past research?

1667
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,440
What honors

1668
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,440
did you get

1669
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,440
in the past research?

1670
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,440
How hard is it to get these honors?

1671
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,440
You need to explain

1672
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,440
to the reviewer.

1673
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,440
Sometimes,

1674
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,440
you may think

1675
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,440
these honors are important

1676
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,440
in your field,

1677
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,440
but the reviewer

1678
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,440
may not know.

1679
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,440
For example,

1680
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,440
he may not know

1681
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,440
what is the

1682
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Wu Moqing Prize.

1683
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,440
It is just a

1684
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,440
certificate of excellence.

1685
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,440
The name of the

1686
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,440
sponsor is

1687
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,440
Wu Moqing.

1688
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,440
So, when you

1689
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,440
describe your honors,

1690
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
you need to explain

1691
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,440
how hard it is

1692
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,440
to get these honors.

1693
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,440
The people who

1694
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,440
get these honors

1695
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,440
are from

1696
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,440
world-renowned academic institutions.

1697
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,440
For example,

1698
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,440
I got a

1699
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,440
Zuckerman Fellowship

1700
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,440
in my postdoc.

1701
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,440
The people who get

1702
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,440
this fellowship

1703
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,440
are from

1704
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,440
MIT, Harvard,

1705
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,440
or Stanford.

1706
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,440
So, when I write

1707
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,440
these honors,

1708
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,440
the reviewer

1709
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,440
will know

1710
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,440
that I was

1711
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,440
trustworthy.

1712
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,440
In other words,

1713
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,440
I did not

1714
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,440
lie.

1715
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,440
When you say

1716
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,440
you want to do

1717
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,440
something great,

1718
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,440
why do people

1719
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,440
believe you?

1720
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,440
Because you did

1721
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,440
something great.

1722
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,440
The third part

1723
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,440
is the

1724
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,440
Global Cooperation Experience

1725
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,440
and the Future Plans

1726
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,440
of the International

1727
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,440
Academy,

1728
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,440
Professional Society,

1729
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,440
and Important Jobs.

1730
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,440
Sorry,

1731
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,440
my PowerPoint

1732
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,440
is a bit messy.

1733
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,440
Let's continue.

1734
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,440
Global Cooperation Experience

1735
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,440
and the Future Plans

1736
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,440
of the International Academy

1737
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,440
is a part of the Columbus Project,

1738
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,440
but I recommend

1739
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,440
people applying for

1740
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
the Einstein Project

1741
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,440
to refer to it.

1742
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,440
When you are

1743
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,440
writing a project,

1744
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,440
you need to

1745
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,440
write a research background.

1746
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,440
You can emphasize

1747
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,440
which teams

1748
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,440
you worked with

1749
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,440
in the field.

1750
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,440
It is important

1751
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,440
to know what problems

1752
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,440
you have solved together.

1753
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,440
You need to

1754
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,440
make a name for yourself.

1755
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,440
If you get

1756
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,440
the project,

1757
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,440
will you

1758
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,440
continue

1759
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
to work with

1760
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,440
international scholars?

1761
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,440
For example,

1762
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,440
will you invite

1763
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,440
international scholars

1764
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,440
to give a speech

1765
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,440
or a workshop

1766
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,440
in Taiwan?

1767
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,440
Will you

1768
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,440
bring international

1769
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,440
research and development

1770
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,440
to Taiwan?

1771
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
This is important

1772
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,440
when you are

1773
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,440
writing a project.

1774
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,440
If you get

1775
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,440
the approval of

1776
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,440
these scholars,

1777
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,440
you can include

1778
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,440
your name, email,

1779
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,440
or even your signature

1780
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,440
in your project.

1781
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,440
This will increase

1782
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,440
the credibility of

1783
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,440
your project.

1784
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,440
Your reviewer

1785
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,440
will be able to

1786
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,440
trust you

1787
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,440
when they see

1788
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,440
the teams

1789
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,440
you worked with

1790
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,440
in the past.

1791
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,440
Next is

1792
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,440
the future plan

1793
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,440
for international scholars

1794
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,440
or professional organizations.

1795
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,440
You can write

1796
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,440
your experience

1797
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,440
as an SCI

1798
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,440
or SSCI editor,

1799
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,440
organizer,

1800
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,440
host,

1801
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,440
or agent.

1802
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,440
For example,

1803
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,440
I have a friend

1804
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,440
who worked

1805
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,440
as a conference

1806
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,440
host

1807
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,440
in Taiwan.

1808
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,440
He wrote

1809
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,440
his experience

1810
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,440
and was

1811
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,440
recognized by

1812
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,440
the reviewer.

1813
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,440
If you have

1814
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,440
held a similar

1815
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,440
conference,

1816
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,440
don't be shy

1817
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,440
and try to

1818
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,440
write your experience

1819
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,440
as an SCI

1820
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,440
or SSCI editor.

1821
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,440
For example,

1822
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,440
how many articles

1823
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,440
you have reviewed,

1824
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,440
how many meetings

1825
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,440
you have held,

1826
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,440
how many cooperation

1827
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,440
plans you have created,

1828
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,440
or even

1829
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,440
whether you are

1830
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,440
able to lead

1831
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,440
cross-domain

1832
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,440
or cross-team

1833
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,440
in the past.

1834
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,440
Here,

1835
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,440
Columbus

1836
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,440
asks you

1837
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,440
your future plan

1838
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,440
for relevant positions.

1839
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,440
So,

1840
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,440
you have to

1841
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,440
explain

1842
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,440
how to use

1843
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,440
your past experience

1844
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,440
as an editor,

1845
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,440
reviewer,

1846
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,440
or SCI

1847
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,440
to improve

1848
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,440
Taiwan's academic ability.

1849
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,440
As we all know,

1850
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,440
being an academic editor

1851
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,440
or

1852
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,440
being

1853
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,440
an

1854
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,440
academic leader

1855
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,440
has a very

1856
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,440
important role

1857
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,440
in improving

1858
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,440
Taiwan's academic status.

1859
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,440
For example,

1860
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,440
you can recommend

1861
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,440
foreign scholars

1862
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,440
to do research

1863
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,440
in Taiwan.

1864
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,440
So,

1865
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,440
being an academic leader

1866
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,440
is very important.

1867
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,440
So,

1868
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,440
when you write your plan,

1869
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,440
you can try to

1870
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,440
figure out

1871
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,440
how to become

1872
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,440
an academic leader

1873
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,440
and how to

1874
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,440
achieve this goal.

1875
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,440
Next,

1876
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Columbus asks you

1877
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,440
your future plan

1878
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,440
for relevant positions.

1879
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,440
So,

1880
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,440
you have to

1881
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,440
explain

1882
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,440
your past experience

1883
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,440
as an editor,

1884
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,440
reviewer,

1885
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,440
or SCI to improve

1886
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,440
Taiwan's academic ability.

1887
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,440
As we all know,

1888
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,440
being an academic leader

1889
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
has a very important role

1890
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,440
in improving

1891
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,440
Taiwan's academic status.

1892
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,440
So,

1893
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,440
you have to

1894
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,440
explain your past experience

1895
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,440
as an editor,

1896
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,440
reviewer,

1897
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,440
or SCI to improve

1898
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,440
Taiwan's academic ability.

1899
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,440
Next,

1900
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,440
Columbus asks you

1901
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,440
your future plan

1902
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,440
for relevant positions.

1903
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,440
So,

1904
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,440
you have to

1905
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,440
explain your past experience

1906
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,440
as an editor,

1907
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,440
reviewer,

1908
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,440
or SCI to improve

1909
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,440
Taiwan's academic ability.

1910
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,440
So,

1911
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,440
you have to

1912
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,440
explain your past experience

1913
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,440
as an editor,

1914
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,440
reviewer,

1915
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,440
or SCI to improve

1916
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,440
Taiwan's academic ability.

1917
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,440
So,

1918
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,440
you don't have to

1919
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,440
explain your past experience

1920
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,440
as an editor,

1921
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,440
reviewer,

1922
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,440
or SCI to improve

1923
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,440
Taiwan's academic ability.

1924
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,440
So,

1925
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,440
you don't have to

1926
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,440
explain your past experience

1927
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,440
as an editor,

1928
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,440
reviewer,

1929
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,440
or SCI to improve

1930
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,440
Taiwan's academic ability.

1931
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,440
So,

1932
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,440
not only can I

1933
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,440
lead Taiwan's students

1934
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,440
to research,

1935
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,440
I can also

1936
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,440
work with students

1937
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,440
from different countries,

1938
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,440
different religious backgrounds,

1939
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,440
and even different skin colors.

1940
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,440
So,

1941
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,440
So,

1942
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,440
what kind of research

1943
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,440
did these people do

1944
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,440
under your leadership?

1945
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,440
You can talk about

1946
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,440
all of these.

1947
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,440
Another part is that

1948
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,440
if you have a lecture,

1949
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,440
don't be shy.

1950
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,440
You can just bring it up

1951
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,440
and let SCI know.

1952
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,440
Why?

1953
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,440
Because the foundation of

1954
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,440
research teams and training

1955
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,440
is very important.

1956
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,440
How do you teach?

1957
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,440
How do you mentor?

1958
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,440
If you have a TA award,

1959
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,440
you can talk about

1960
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,440
what kind of problems

1961
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,440
you encountered in the course of teaching,

1962
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,440
what changes you made,

1963
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,440
and how your team

1964
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,440
worked well.

1965
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,440
Also,

1966
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,440
you can talk about

1967
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,440
your research results.

1968
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,440
So,

1969
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,440
I hope you can

1970
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,440
talk about

1971
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,440
your past experiences

1972
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,440
so that SCI

1973
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,440
can clearly understand

1974
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,440
that you have the ability

1975
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,440
to build and train your team.

1976
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,440
Yuxu,

1977
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,440
hold on.

1978
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,440
We have 10 minutes left.

1979
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,440
This segment is a bit long.

1980
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,440
Let's stop here.

1981
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,440
If you have

1982
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,440
any additional questions,

1983
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,440
you can email me.

1984
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,440
I can answer

1985
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,440
your questions individually.

1986
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,440
Yuxu's email

1987
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,440
is here.

1988
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,440
You can copy it.

1989
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
If you want to copy it,

1990
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,440
I can listen to it.

1991
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,440
You can write your email

1992
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,440
or if you have

1993
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,440
any questions, you can chat.

1994
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,440
If we have time,

1995
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,440
we can come back and continue.

1996
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,440
We have one more question.

1997
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,440
I believe

1998
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,440
everyone cares about

1999
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,440
whether our speakers

2000
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,440
have experience in

2001
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,440
other countries or

2002
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,440
Europe or

2003
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,440
Israel.

2004
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,440
What do they think

2005
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,440
about the cultural differences

2006
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,440
between Taiwan and

2007
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,440
other places

2008
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,440
in terms of

2009
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,440
industry and

2010
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,440
industry energy?

2011
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,440
How do they decide

2012
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,440
to return to Taiwan

2013
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,440
or stay abroad?

2014
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,440
Or how do they see

2015
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,440
the future development?

2016
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
Let's start with Hao Wei.

2017
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,440
Okay, no problem.

2018
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,440
I think

2019
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,440
your question is

2020
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
about the difference

2021
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,440
between Taiwan and

2022
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,440
the United States

2023
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,440
in terms of

2024
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,440
industry and

2025
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,440
industry energy.

2026
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,440
Hello?

2027
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,440
Can you hear me?

2028
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,440
If you can hear me,

2029
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,440
you can continue.

2030
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,440
I'm just repeating your question.

2031
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,440
Okay.

2032
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,440
I think

2033
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,440
as a Taiwanese,

2034
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,440
we always think

2035
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,440
even if I stay here

2036
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,440
for 10 years,

2037
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,440
I still think

2038
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,440
I might return to Taiwan one day.

2039
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,440
I think Taiwan's energy

2040
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,440
is quite strong

2041
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,440
when it comes to

2042
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,440
industry and industry energy.

2043
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,440
So I actually thought

2044
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,440
I might return to Taiwan one day.

2045
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,440
But the biggest difference

2046
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,440
is probably

2047
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,440
the capital

2048
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,440
and the

2049
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,440
idea of

2050
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,440
starting a business

2051
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,440
is quite different.

2052
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,440
So the size of the company

2053
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,440
and the idea of investors

2054
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,440
are quite different.

2055
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,440
So the capital

2056
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,440
and the business talent

2057
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,440
are probably more professional

2058
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,440
when it comes to the company's valuation.

2059
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,440
On the other hand,

2060
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,440
in terms of business,

2061
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,440
Boston's energy

2062
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,440
is really strong.

2063
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,440
It's one of the best places in the world.

2064
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,440
So

2065
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,440
it takes a lot of capital

2066
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,440
to do the research.

2067
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,440
So it's just starting in Taiwan.

2068
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,440
So we have a lot of BTBA

2069
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,440
friends who will return to Taiwan

2070
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,440
to help

2071
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,440
build these things.

2072
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,440
So I hope one day

2073
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,440
we can really build up

2074
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,440
Taiwan's biotechnology

2075
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,440
or medical technology.

2076
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,440
I think even though we're still in the US,

2077
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,440
we can still help a lot

2078
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,440
with these links.

2079
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,440
Yeah, that's it.

2080
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,440
I have a question.

2081
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,440
Sorry.

2082
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,440
Let me adjust my network.

2083
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,440
Why is it like this?

2084
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
Sorry.

2085
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,440
Can you hear me?

2086
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,440
Yes.

2087
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,440
My question is

2088
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,440
about

2089
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,440
wanting to return to Taiwan.

2090
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,440
Do you have any experience

2091
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,440
or have you heard

2092
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,440
whether Taiwan's current industry

2093
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,440
or the government

2094
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,440
has any

2095
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,440
willingness to cooperate

2096
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,440
or any plans

2097
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,440
for Taiwan?

2098
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,440
What are their motives?

2099
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,440
I think

2100
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,440
after Minister Chen Liangji took office,

2101
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,440
he proposed a lot of

2102
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,440
plans

2103
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,440
for returning to Taiwan.

2104
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,440
So he can

2105
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,440
let you find a job for a year

2106
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,440
and then you can find

2107
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
the job you really want to do.

2108
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,440
He has provided some plans

2109
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,440
to make it more smooth.

2110
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,440
So I think it's not bad.

2111
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,440
OK.

2112
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,440
But when it comes to

2113
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,440
job opportunities,

2114
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,440
it really depends

2115
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,440
on the industry.

2116
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,440
The prices in the US are higher,

2117
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,440
so you usually get paid when you go back.

2118
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,440
But this is expected.

2119
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,440
Yeah.

2120
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,440
OK.

2121
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,440
So do you think,

2122
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,440
at least as you mentioned,

2123
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,440
the government

2124
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,440
has expressed its willingness

2125
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,440
and actually has plans

2126
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,440
to help you

2127
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,440
return to Taiwan

2128
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,440
or get a job in Taiwan?

2129
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,440
Yes.

2130
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,440
It's called LIFT.

2131
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,440
Oh, OK. LIFT.

2132
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,440
You can check it out.

2133
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,440
I've heard of it before.

2134
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,440
I'm not familiar with it,

2135
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,440
but I'm sure you can find it on the Internet.

2136
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,440
Can we ask Mu-Jie

2137
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,440
about your experience in Europe

2138
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,440
and in the US

2139
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,440
since you've just been here for a year?

2140
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,440
What do you think is the difference?

2141
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,440
What do you think is the difference

2142
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,440
between good and bad

2143
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,440
and what do you think?

2144
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,440
I think

2145
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,440
in the US

2146
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,440
or other places other than Taiwan,

2147
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,440
I think everyone knows

2148
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,440
that the salary is higher.

2149
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,440
In the US,

2150
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,440
you have the smartest people

2151
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,440
in the world.

2152
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,440
Most of the outstanding students

2153
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,440
are in the US.

2154
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,440
I don't think

2155
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,440
we need to emphasize the benefits.

2156
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,440
But I think

2157
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,440
now,

2158
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,440
especially in the academic world,

2159
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,440
if you're willing to come back

2160
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,440
at this time,

2161
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,440
I think it's a good opportunity.

2162
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,440
The reason is that the current minister

2163
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,440
and the overall social atmosphere

2164
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,440
probably all know

2165
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,440
that fewer and fewer people

2166
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,440
are willing to come back.

2167
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,440
I'm not just talking about

2168
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,440
the Colombo-Einstein project.

2169
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,440
It's not that everyone can get it.

2170
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,440
But regardless of

2171
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,440
your general plan,

2172
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,440
in fact,

2173
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,440
there are quite a few

2174
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,440
increases in salary and annual income.

2175
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,440
But in my own field,

2176
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,440
in the past,

2177
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,440
you might have a one-year or two-year plan.

2178
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,440
But now, the meaning of the minister

2179
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,440
is to give people

2180
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,440
three or even four years.

2181
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,440
The amount of salary

2182
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,440
will be higher than before.

2183
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,440
In addition,

2184
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,440
the current social atmosphere

2185
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,440
has been saying that

2186
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,440
the salary of professors in Taiwan

2187
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,440
is very low.

2188
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,440
Now,

2189
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,440
all professors in Taiwan

2190
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,440
still have the same standard

2191
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,440
of paying salary.

2192
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,440
But each school

2193
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,440
actually has

2194
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,440
a lot of different

2195
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,440
basic salary plans.

2196
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,440
So I think

2197
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,440
at least in the early stages,

2198
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,440
you don't have to worry

2199
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,440
too much about money.

2200
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,440
Whether it's research money

2201
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,440
or your salary money,

2202
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,440
you don't have to worry too much.

2203
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,440
Of course, in terms of absolute numbers,

2204
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,440
it's impossible to compare

2205
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,440
with the U.S. or other countries

2206
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,440
because the prices are different.

2207
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,440
So I don't think

2208
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,440
you need to worry about this.

2209
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,440
When I came back before,

2210
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,440
or other young professors

2211
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,440
told me that

2212
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,440
Taiwan's current atmosphere

2213
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,440
is more and more like

2214
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,440
as long as you do well,

2215
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,440
you don't have to worry

2216
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,440
about your salary

2217
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,440
or your research money.

2218
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,440
There must be

2219
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,440
a lot of different

2220
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,440
flexible salary plans.

2221
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,440
For example,

2222
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,440
I know someone

2223
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,440
who is a professor in Taiwan.

2224
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,440
If you really do well,

2225
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,440
there are a lot of different bonuses.

2226
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,440
There are some additional bonuses.

2227
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,440
After you get the bonuses,

2228
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,440
technology will match

2229
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,440
your research money.

2230
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,440
There are

2231
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,440
other professors

2232
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,440
who told me that

2233
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,440
the advantage of Taiwan,

2234
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,440
especially in the academic world,

2235
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,440
is that you have a high chance

2236
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,440
to pass your plan.

2237
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,440
But at least

2238
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,440
you can do

2239
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,440
what you want to do.

2240
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,440
Of course, if you say

2241
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,440
you need 30 million or more devices

2242
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,440
to do an experiment,

2243
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,440
that's another story.

2244
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,440
But in general,

2245
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,440
I saw Zhang Yanyong shaking his head.

2246
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,440
In general,

2247
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,440
there should be no problem.

2248
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,440
I and Ye Yong

2249
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,440
are shaking our heads.

2250
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,440
I didn't see the other one.

2251
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,440
I think this is the current

2252
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,440
atmosphere in Taiwan.

2253
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,440
I think

2254
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,440
I wanted to come back

2255
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,440
for a part of the reason.

2256
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,440
I don't know if you know

2257
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,440
Chen Yunlong,

2258
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,440
who often appears on TV.

2259
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,440
The reason is very similar.

2260
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,440
I like living in Taiwan.

2261
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,440
I like living in Taiwan,

2262
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,440
so I'm willing to come back.

2263
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,440
At that time, I thought

2264
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,440
if I stayed in the United States,

2265
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,440
I would only go to the industry.

2266
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,440
If I really want to be a teacher,

2267
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,440
I will think I want to go back to Taiwan.

2268
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,440
Because I think

2269
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,440
if I want to teach the next generation,

2270
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,440
I will want to teach

2271
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,440
people on my own land.

2272
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,440
I don't know if you have seen it.

2273
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,440
Yuan Jian also reported that

2274
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,440
Chen Yunlong's mother

2275
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,440
said that

2276
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,440
if he didn't come back,

2277
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,440
his mother would tell him that

2278
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,440
she could only see him

2279
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,440
in Taiwan.

2280
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,440
I know when you are young,

2281
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,440
you think it's good to travel abroad.

2282
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,440
But I have discussed with

2283
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,440
some people around me.

2284
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,440
Many people think

2285
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,440
if I stay in the U.S. or abroad

2286
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,440
for 10 or 15 years,

2287
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,440
I still want to come back.

2288
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,440
It depends on

2289
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,440
whether you are willing to

2290
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,440
take these 10 or 15 years

2291
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,440
to spend time with your family

2292
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,440
and friends

2293
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,440
or if you are willing to

2294
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,440
find a job in the U.S.

2295
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,440
or other countries.

2296
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,440
Whether it's economic or

2297
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,440
other aspects,

2298
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,440
it's a better return.

2299
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,440
I don't think this is wrong.

2300
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,440
It's just that everyone's

2301
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,440
views are different.

2302
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,440
Overall, I think that

2303
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,440
Taiwan's support for young teachers

2304
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,440
is quite high.

2305
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,440
This also involves another thing.

2306
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,440
If you are really willing to

2307
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,440
travel abroad,

2308
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,440
you may want to

2309
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,440
inquire about the atmosphere

2310
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,440
of each school.

2311
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,440
The atmosphere of

2312
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,440
different schools

2313
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,440
may be different.

2314
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,440
You may want to

2315
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,440
inquire about

2316
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,440
the support for young people.

2317
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,440
I am quite lucky that

2318
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,440
our school is quite good.

2319
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,440
Some places may be worse.

2320
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,440
You may want to

2321
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,440
find a job in the U.S.

2322
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,440
or other countries.

2323
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,440
It's a good return.

2324
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,440
It's a good time.

2325
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,440
Actually,

2326
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,440
we are running out of time.

2327
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,440
I think we have covered

2328
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,440
a lot of interesting points today.

2329
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,440
Of course,

2330
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,440
everyone still has a lot of questions.

2331
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,440
Otherwise,

2332
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,440
can we ask the three speakers

2333
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,440
to summarize in two or three minutes

2334
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,440
what they think about

2335
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,440
changing the job of

2336
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,440
PhD students and post-doctorate students?

2337
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,440
In the process of summarizing,

2338
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,440
everyone can think about

2339
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,440
if there are any questions.

2340
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,440
You can type them in the chat.

2341
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,440
At the end,

2342
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,440
we will have a short Q&A.

2343
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,440
Let's start with Yuxun.

2344
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,440
I think

2345
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,440
the global population is expanding.

2346
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,440
There are 7 billion people now.

2347
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,440
Even if it is a school,

2348
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,440
it is difficult to promote.

2349
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,440
Although I am

2350
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,440
a survivor,

2351
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,440
it is not very convincing.

2352
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,440
But what I want to say is

2353
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,440
don't be too persistent

2354
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,440
and have to go a certain way.

2355
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,440
Let yourself stay flexible.

2356
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,440
When I was studying

2357
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,440
for a master's degree,

2358
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,440
I spent a lot of time

2359
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,440
studying stock trading.

2360
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,440
So I thought about

2361
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
if I want to do research,

2362
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,440
whether I do research or not,

2363
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,440
I need money.

2364
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,440
If I do research,

2365
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,440
it is difficult to make a fortune.

2366
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,440
So if I invest in finance,

2367
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,440
I can maintain my basic living expenses.

2368
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,440
It feels good, right?

2369
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,440
In addition to studying finance,

2370
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,440
I also attend

2371
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,440
some

2372
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,440
lectures

2373
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,440
on communication skills.

2374
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,440
To sum up,

2375
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,440
don't go too far

2376
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,440
and try to

2377
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,440
stay flexible.

2378
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,440
As I said at the beginning,

2379
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,440
do what you want to do,

2380
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,440
but do it in the right way.

2381
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,440
Go in the direction you want to go.

2382
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,440
But don't set the direction

2383
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,440
too narrow.

2384
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,440
Make it a wider direction.

2385
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,440
Don't make

2386
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,440
precise mistakes

2387
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,440
even if it is wrong.

2388
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,440
This is what I want to

2389
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,440
share with you today.

2390
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,440
Don't ask me

2391
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,440
what I want.

2392
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,440
I have invested in stocks for so many years.

2393
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,440
Hello?

2394
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,440
Can you hear me?

2395
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,440
Can you hear me?

2396
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,440
I can hear you now.

2397
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,440
Can you

2398
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,440
summarize

2399
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,440
your thoughts?

2400
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,440
Okay, no problem.

2401
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,440
I think

2402
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,440
it is good

2403
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,440
that everyone is willing to

2404
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,440
participate in this event.

2405
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,440
I think the most important part

2406
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,440
of NPS is networking.

2407
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,440
You need to get to know more people

2408
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,440
and know what everyone is doing.

2409
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,440
After graduation,

2410
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,440
these networks will continue to grow.

2411
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,440
For a long time,

2412
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,440
like what they said,

2413
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,440
Ph.D. is looking for the next job.

2414
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,440
70% of them are introduced by people they know.

2415
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,440
So,

2416
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,440
networking is really important.

2417
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,440
I hope everyone can

2418
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,440
get to know more people

2419
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,440
and know more about what this world is doing

2420
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,440
in the life of a postdoc or PhD.

2421
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,440
Of course,

2422
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,440
the academic world is really competitive.

2423
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,440
According to statistics,

2424
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,440
those who can become

2425
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,440
a professor

2426
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,440
are the top 10%.

2427
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,440
Many people will eventually

2428
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,440
enter the industry,

2429
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,440
but there are still many opportunities

2430
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,440
for you to develop

2431
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,440
and do what you want to do.

2432
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,440
So, I hope everyone can explore more.

2433
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,440
And there are many

2434
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,440
top things

2435
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,440
that you can do.

2436
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,440
This is really cool.

2437
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,440
Thank you, Hao Wei.

2438
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,440
Mu Jie, please summarize.

2439
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,440
No problem.

2440
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,440
I don't think what Hao Wei said is right.

2441
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,440
I don't think

2442
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,440
the top 10%

2443
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,440
come to the academic world.

2444
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,440
I think a big part

2445
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,440
is that everyone's career path

2446
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,440
is different.

2447
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,440
Many people who are better than me

2448
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,440
eventually choose to go to the industry.

2449
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,440
Then I can find

2450
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,440
something to live for.

2451
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,440
Actually, I think

2452
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,440
my point of view is very similar

2453
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,440
to what Yuxin said.

2454
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,440
I think

2455
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,440
you have to choose

2456
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,440
what you really want to do.

2457
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,440
No matter

2458
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,440
if you choose a research topic

2459
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,440
or whether you want to go to the industry or the classroom.

2460
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,440
I think this is a very important thing.

2461
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,440
Especially when you can still choose,

2462
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,440
it's actually a very happy thing.

2463
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,440
So when you can choose,

2464
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,440
try to choose what you think you're interested in.

2465
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,440
Because I think what you're interested in

2466
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,440
is what you're willing to spend time and effort

2467
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,440
to do it well.

2468
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,440
Because when you're a professor,

2469
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,440
it's actually quite tiring.

2470
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,440
Because there are a lot of mixed things.

2471
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,440
But when you like to do this,

2472
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,440
you can really do it well.

2473
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,440
I also think what Yuxin said

2474
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,440
is very good.

2475
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,440
Don't worry about

2476
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,440
giving yourself

2477
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,440
the courage

2478
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,440
to correct your direction.

2479
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,440
Correcting earlier

2480
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,440
is always better than correcting later.

2481
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,440
Don't feel like

2482
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,440
I have to be a professor.

2483
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:08,440
In the end, you really can't be a professor.

2484
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,440
Or no matter what the reason is,

2485
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,440
you decide not to be a professor.

2486
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,440
Don't be afraid of what others will think.

2487
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,440
Because no one will be responsible for your life.

2488
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,440
Only you have to be responsible for your own life.

2489
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,440
So I think the most important thing

2490
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:22,440
is actually this.

2491
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,440
Thank you.

2492
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,440
I think the three speakers

2493
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,440
talked very well today.

2494
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,440
Please turn on the microphone now

2495
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,440
so that the speakers can hear our applause.

2496
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,440
Please give a round of applause

2497
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,440
to thank the three speakers

2498
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,440
for sharing with us today.

2499
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,440
Thank you.

2500
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,440
Because our time today

2501
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,440
is a bit short,

2502
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,440
but I guess there are still people who want to discuss,

2503
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,440
so I will turn off the recording first.
