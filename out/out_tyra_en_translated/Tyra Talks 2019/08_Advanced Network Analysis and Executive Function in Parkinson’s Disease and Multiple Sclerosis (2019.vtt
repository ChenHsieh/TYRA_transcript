00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Thank you everyone for coming to this talk.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
We are very happy to invite Dr. Lin Shujing from the University of Columbia, UBC, Canada.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
Dr. Lin was trained at the University of Zhongshan Medical University,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
in the Department of Radiation Science and Imaging.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
After graduating from this university,

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
he obtained the qualification of a Radiologist of the Republic of China.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
However, he was very interested in academic research,

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
so he later completed a master's degree from the Institute of Brain Science at the University of Columbia.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
After the master's degree,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
he also served as a research assistant at the University of Yangming,

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Rongzhong, Taipei City Hospital, and Jiaotong University.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
In 2012, he went to the University of Columbia, UBC, Canada,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
to start his doctorate in Neuroscience.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
He graduated in 2018.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
Today's talk is mainly about his doctoral thesis.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I am very happy and grateful that he is here to share with us.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
This talk is about the connection between the functions of the brain and neurodegenerative diseases,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
as well as the connection between cognitive functions.

01:29.000 --> 01:40.000
Let's welcome him with a round of applause.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Can you turn up the volume?

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
If not, let me know in the chat.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
I can do it here.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
You can? Okay.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Thank you for the introduction.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
What I am going to talk about today is basically what I did in my PhD thesis.

01:57.000 --> 02:08.000
The structure of today's talk will be based on the order of the chapters in my thesis.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
The title is a bit long.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Let me explain.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
The title of my thesis is called Advanced Neural Analysis of Resin-stained Functional Connectivity

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
to Probe Exactive Functions in Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis.

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
In simple terms, it is a way to look at the connection between the functions of the brain and cognitive functions

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
in neurodegenerative diseases.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Let's move on.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I wrote seven chapters in total.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
The presentation will follow the order of the chapters.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
In the first part, I will put the first and second chapters together.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
The purpose of putting the first and second chapters together is to give you a brief introduction,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
including the symptoms of these two diseases and their clinical symptoms.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I will also put the second chapter together

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
because the second chapter is purely about behavioral studies.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
So it will give you a more comprehensive introduction.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
The third and sixth chapters are related to fMRI.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
In short, we used different methods to analyze Resin-stained fMRI data.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
We got different measurements.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
On the one hand, we want to see if these different measurements can be used as biomarkers

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
to clearly distinguish between patients and normal people.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
On the other hand, we want to see if these measurements are related to fMRI.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
The seventh chapter is summary.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Let's move on to the first and second chapters.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
In the first chapter, we will briefly introduce Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
These two neurodegenerative diseases are the main structure of the whole paper.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Parkinson's disease is more familiar to Taiwanese people.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
It is a neurodegenerative disease,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
which is common in men and older patients,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
for example, about 50 or 60 years old.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Another type of multiple sclerosis is called multiple sclerosis,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
but it is more common in slightly younger women.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
It is more common in Europe and the United States,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
such as the United States, Canada, and North Europe.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
It is also common in Taiwan, but relatively rare.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
The picture on the right is a brief introduction.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
The basic cause of multiple sclerosis is that the nerve on the left is a nerve tree,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
and there is a bulge on the outside called the myelin.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
The structure of the myelin is attacked by a killer T cell,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
so it is a kind of autoimmune disease.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
This attack will cause the transmission of the nerve signal to slow down or cause some errors.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
On the clinical table, we can see that there is a problem with the coordination between the head and the eyes,

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
and the patient's walking will be more unbalanced.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
There are also a lot of visual problems,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
and the patient often says,

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
oh, I'm very tired. This is called fatigue.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
There are also some cognitive function disorders.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Another Parkinson's disease is more common.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
The main cause of the disease is that the neurotransmitter in the brain is not enough,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
and this neurotransmitter is called dopamine or dopamine.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
In normal people's brains, you can see this picture.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
This black part is a neurotransmitter that produces dopamine,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
and this part is called the subcentral nigra.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
You can see that it's very dark here,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
but in Parkinson's disease patients, these black things are gone,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
which is the death of neurotransmitters that produce dopamine,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
which leads to insufficient concentration of neurotransmitter.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
For example, we often hear tremor,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
and there is a problem with sleep, and there is a problem with walking balance.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
In addition, there are also some cognitive function disorders.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
So you can see that PD and MS are two very different diseases,

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
but they both produce cognitive impairment.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
According to clinical evidence and previous literature review,

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
MS produces the most cognitive functions,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
including executive function,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
and Parkinson's disease visual memory.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
PD is also an executive function,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
and most people will have these problems,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
as well as walking memory and visual spatial abilities.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
In addition to the clinical evidence and literature review,

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
we are also very interested in whether these cognitive function disorders

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
are related to the severity of their clinical disease or other factors.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
So in the second part, we did a simple analysis.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
We use Canonical Correlation Analysis,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
abbreviated as CCA,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
to see if their cognitive function performance

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
is related to other clinical data.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Let me briefly introduce what CCA is.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
It is a multivariate statistical approach.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
The main purpose of CCA is to find two pieces of data.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Let's say we have two pieces of data, U and V.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
The purpose of CCA is to find these so-called weights.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
These weights will let us know

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
what kind of linear combination will make U and V the most relevant.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
In other words, CCA finds this weight,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and then we can infer

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
whether X1 is the most relevant,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
or whether Y2 is the most relevant.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
In the second part of the study,

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
one of the data is the demographic on clinical data,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
such as the severity of the disease or age.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
The other piece of data is the performance of cognitive function.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
We did some tests,

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
and then we took their scores to make a set of data.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Let's take a look at the results on PD.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
As we said, the purpose of CCA is to find linear combinations

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
to make these two pieces of data the most relevant.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So here you can see that

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
these two pieces of data are indeed very relevant.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
The relevant factor is 0.9.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
One of them is demographic on clinical data,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
and the other is cognitive function.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Because we put gender in it,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
all the variables are...

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Wait a minute, it's not out yet.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
All the variables are positive,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
and the positive loading is related to the male.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
All the negative loading is related to the female.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And then, if all the variables are the same,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
for example, positive loading,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
they are both positive.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
If negative loading occurs,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
they are both positive.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
This means that if this number goes up,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
the other numbers related to it will also go up.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
So let's take a look now.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
In general, the result tells us that

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
in the case of PD patients,

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
if the male is also in a more serious state of depression,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
it has nothing to do with cognitive function.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
But let's take a look at the following.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
In other words, women with higher education

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
have a longer period of education,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
which has a lot to do with most of the better cognitive functions.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
These are a series of tests we tested.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Actually, this is not what we tested.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
This is a database called PPMI.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
If you are interested, we can discuss it later.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
They tested a lot of different cognitive domains.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
In principle, the higher the number,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
the better the cognitive function and the better the response.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
So you can see that women with higher education

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
have better cognitive performance.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
As for MS, let's take a look.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
This is the data we received.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
The same thing.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
The positive loading is related to the male.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
If the negative loading is related to the female.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Let's take a look at the cognitive function part.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
These two are TMT, trial making test A and B.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Basically, it's a test of attention,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
and executive function.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
What you can find is that in women,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
you can see that if it's a woman,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
negative loading,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
these two tests will perform better on women.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.000
At the same time, we have another set of different cognitive functions.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Here, you can see that if it's a male,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
it will be related to EDS.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
EDS is an indicator on MS Clinical.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
The higher the EDS value,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
the more serious the disease.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
On the other side,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
it's the Wisconsin Consultant Error.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
In other words, the higher the EDS value,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
the more serious the disease,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
the more mistakes it makes.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
On the other hand,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
for women,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
their performance will be better.

11:29.000 --> 11:39.000
You can see that these two tests are closely related.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
here is a conclusion.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
We have categorized the same and different cognitive functions

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
of PD and MS.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
For the same function,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
we find that gender is a very important factor,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
whether it's PD or MS.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Especially for women,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
their cognitive functions seem to be better.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
On the other hand,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
for PD,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
the higher the EDS value,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
the better the cognitive function.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
We can use the so-called Cognitive Research Theory

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
to explain this.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
In this theory,

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
the longer the EDS value,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
the more protective it is.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So, if a person has been educated for a long time,

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
he may get sick later in life.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
The early education

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
may not be able to protect his cognitive function.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
In addition,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
we also found that

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
in the case of PD,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
at first,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
we were surprised to find that

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
the clinical indicators of PD

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
are not related to cognitive functions.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
One possibility is that

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
the clinical indicators of PD,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
which is similar to MS EDSS,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
but we call it UPDRS,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
are actually evaluated

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
based on the symptoms of the action.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It is also possible that

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
the neurotransmitters

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
related to action

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
and cognitive functions are different.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
In addition, in the case of MS,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
we can see that

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
the more serious the disease is,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
it is related to the worse cognitive functions.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
As we just mentioned,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
it made more mistakes.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Okay,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
this part is purely about

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
the fact that

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
there is no FMI involved in behavior.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Next, we are going to talk about FMI.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
As we all know,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
if you have a little bit of research on MS,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Functional MRI is a non-invasive method.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
We can use this non-invasive method

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
to study the human brain

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
or the activity in the animal brain.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And we usually take this material

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
for a period of time.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Most of the data we use

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
in this study is racing state,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
which means that we require the victim

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
to lie in the machine,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
close their eyes,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
and don't think about anything special.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
This is called racing state.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
This method is actually

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
more feasible in clinical trials,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
because many of the victims are patients,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
and they can't cooperate with you

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
to do some tasks.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
For example, you may have to

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
respond to a case,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
which is a little difficult for patients,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
especially patients with Parkinson's disease.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
In addition, even if it is racing state,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
the victim did not do anything.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
It still relies on the activity of the brain

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
to communicate a lot of cognitive functions.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Then,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I will explain the so-called

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
functional connectivity here.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
In other words,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
because this word often appears in the back,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
for example, we get the racing state

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
fMRI data.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
What we need to analyze now is to look at

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
its functional connectivity.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Suppose you are interested in

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
many different brains today.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
The so-called functional connectivity

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
is the signal of fMRI in these brains.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Are they related to each other?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I'll just use a picture to explain.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
It may be easier to understand.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Suppose you have a brain today,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
and we are interested in three areas.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
We call it Region of Interest,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
which is called RRI.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
After some preliminary processing,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
such as the difference in time,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
or the difference in head movement,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
we get these fMRI data.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
It's a bit like

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
getting these fMRI data

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
is to get the fMRI signals

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
of these three brains.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Then use some statistical methods to calculate

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
whether the fMRI signals between

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Brain 1 and Brain 2 are related.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
If they are related,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
we will think that these two brain areas

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
are connected to each other.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
In addition, there are many

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
different ways to calculate.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
The most common is

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Pairwise Correlation.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
There is also Partial Correlation

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
or Mutual Information.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
There are many ways to calculate.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
There is no limit to this.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It depends on how you use it.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
The most common thing we see is a matrix,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
a color-coded matrix.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
If you are interested in this,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
it means that

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
RRI1 and RRI2 are highly related.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It means that

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
RRI1 and RRI2 are related.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
We know that they are connected.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
In conclusion,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
even if

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
we are in a resting state,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
we can still use this kind of data

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
to observe

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
its functional connectivity

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
and then study

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
whether these functional connectivity

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
are related or not.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Next,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
since we want to study

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
cognitive functions,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
especially Exciter Functions,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
because both PDS and MS

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
are prone to

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Exciter Functions.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
So we did some

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
literature review.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
We found that

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
these are the brain areas

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
that are most related

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
to Exciter Functions

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
You can see that

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
most of the connections

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
are Frontal Parietal Region.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
It means that

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Frontal Parietal Region

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
and Exciter Functions

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
are related.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
PDS is the same.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Frontal Parietal Region

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
and RCP are also related.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
In addition,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
there are connections in the opposite brain area.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
So we have a conclusion that

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
the so-called Long Range Connection

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
is very important

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
for Exciter Functions.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
The so-called Long Range Connection

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
is a cortical-to-cortical connection.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Just like what we said here,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Frontal to Parietal.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Next,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
what we just observed

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
is very similar to a model.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
This was proposed by

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Melvin Cohen in 2001.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
They believe that

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
there are three components in Exciter Function.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
The first one is Input.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Input is the transfer of

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
sensory information to

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
the internal state.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
The internal state is in the Prefrontal Cortex.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
These signals are transferred to

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
the Prefrontal Cortex for processing.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
After processing,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
the Prefrontal Cortex transfers the signals

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
to the Output Component.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
The Output Component

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
is in the subcortical area.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
The Prefrontal Cortex

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
is in the subcortical region.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
The Output Component

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
and the Subcortical Region

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
must cooperate with the

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Motor Cortex

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
to execute the

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
processed signals.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
It is very important

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
to study the cognitive functions

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
as well as

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
how different brain areas

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
work together

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
and cooperate.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
This is the main goal

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and architecture of the paper.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
This is the main goal

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and architecture of the paper.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
That's all for today's presentation.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That's all for today's presentation.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
We have already explained

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
the first and second chapters.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
We will move on to the

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
FMI section.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
The third chapter is

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
focused on connection.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
However,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I found that

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
the third chapter is too long,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
so I will skip it for now.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
We can discuss it later.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
We can discuss it later.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
The fourth chapter is

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
static brain organization.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
The fourth chapter is

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
static brain organization.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
The fifth chapter is

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
dynamic functional connectivity.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
The fifth chapter is

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
dynamic functional connectivity.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
The fifth chapter is

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
sliding window approach.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
We will put together

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
the fourth and fifth chapters

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
to see if

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
these measurements

20:06.000 --> 20:07.900
are related to

20:07.900 --> 20:09.900
clinical indicators or cognitive functions.

20:09.900 --> 20:09.900


20:09.900 --> 20:11.900
clinical indicators or cognitive functions.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.900
That's the conclusion of the seventh chapter.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.900
That's all.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.900
Now we are moving to

20:17.900 --> 20:19.900
the fourth chapter,

20:19.900 --> 20:21.900
the FDIL section.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.900
Does anyone have any questions?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.900
Does anyone have any questions?

20:25.900 --> 20:27.900
Let's get started

20:27.900 --> 20:29.900
with the fourth chapter.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.900
The fourth chapter is

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
the Brain Organization section.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.900
The so-called

20:35.900 --> 20:37.900
Brain Organization

20:37.900 --> 20:39.900
is to study

20:39.900 --> 20:41.900
how the brain

20:41.900 --> 20:43.900
is organized.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.900
There are several main principles.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.900
First, we see

20:47.900 --> 20:49.900
Functional Integration,

20:49.900 --> 20:51.900
Functional Segregation, and

20:51.900 --> 20:53.900
HUB Structure.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.900
I will use a picture to explain.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.900
As you can see,

20:57.900 --> 20:59.900
there are many dots and lines.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.900
Each dot represents

21:01.900 --> 21:03.900
a brain region in our brain,

21:03.900 --> 21:05.900
the RRI.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.900
Each line represents

21:07.900 --> 21:09.900
the connection between

21:09.900 --> 21:11.900
the two brain regions.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.900
We think they have a connection.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.900
The picture on the right

21:15.900 --> 21:17.900
has many different colors.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.900
Each color represents

21:19.900 --> 21:21.900
the individual community.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.900
In other words,

21:23.900 --> 21:25.900
this region

21:25.900 --> 21:27.900
will form a network

21:27.900 --> 21:29.900
between each other.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.900
The so-called

21:31.900 --> 21:33.900
Functional Integration

21:33.900 --> 21:35.900
represents

21:35.900 --> 21:37.900
how well

21:37.900 --> 21:39.900
the neural signal

21:39.900 --> 21:41.900
is integrated

21:41.900 --> 21:43.900
globally in the brain.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.900
It is a community

21:45.900 --> 21:47.900
that crosses different colors.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.900
On the other hand,

21:49.900 --> 21:51.900
Functional Segregation

21:51.900 --> 21:53.900
represents how well

21:53.900 --> 21:55.900
the neural signal

21:55.900 --> 21:57.900
is integrated

21:57.900 --> 21:59.900
in the individual community.

21:59.900 --> 22:01.900
So, Functional Integration

22:01.900 --> 22:03.900
and Functional Segregation

22:03.900 --> 22:05.900
are the opposite.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.900
One is in the community,

22:07.900 --> 22:09.900
the other is across the community.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.900
Finally, there is a concept

22:11.900 --> 22:13.900
called HUB Structure.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.900
Let's look at

22:15.900 --> 22:17.900
the middle dot.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.900
As you can see,

22:19.900 --> 22:21.900
the HUB Structure

22:21.900 --> 22:23.900
has more dots than

22:23.900 --> 22:25.900
other dots in the community.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.900
This means that

22:27.900 --> 22:29.900
the RRI is very important

22:29.900 --> 22:31.900
in this network.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.900
It plays a central role.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.900
So, we think

22:35.900 --> 22:37.900
it is a HUB Structure.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.900
At the same time,

22:39.900 --> 22:41.900
it has many different connections

22:41.900 --> 22:43.900
than other dots.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.900
HUB Structure Integration

22:45.900 --> 22:47.900
and Segregation

22:47.900 --> 22:49.900
can be obtained

22:49.900 --> 22:51.900
through Graph Analysis.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.900
So far, I think

22:53.900 --> 22:55.900
Graph Theory

22:55.900 --> 22:57.900
is a good way

22:57.900 --> 22:59.900
to integrate

22:59.900 --> 23:01.900
Functional Connectivity.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.900
As we mentioned before,

23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
after you get

23:05.900 --> 23:07.900
the correlation matrix,

23:07.900 --> 23:09.900
you will have too much information.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.900
At the same time,

23:11.900 --> 23:13.900
if you have hundreds of RRIs,

23:13.900 --> 23:15.900
you don't know where to start.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.900
So, Graph Theory

23:17.900 --> 23:19.900
is a good way

23:19.900 --> 23:21.900
to tell you

23:21.900 --> 23:23.900
whether your network

23:23.900 --> 23:25.900
is integrated or segregated.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.900
In addition,

23:27.900 --> 23:29.900
you can get many

23:29.900 --> 23:31.900
different Graphical Measures

23:31.900 --> 23:33.900
through Graph Theory.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.900
Each Measure

23:35.900 --> 23:37.900
represents a network feature.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.900
These Measures

23:39.900 --> 23:41.900
can be connected

23:41.900 --> 23:43.900
to cognitive functions.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.900
So,

23:45.900 --> 23:47.900
these are the research

23:47.900 --> 23:49.900
done on normal people.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.900
As for the disease,

23:51.900 --> 23:53.900
we also did some

23:53.900 --> 23:55.900
literature review.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.900
Overall,

23:57.900 --> 23:59.900
we can see that

23:59.900 --> 24:01.900
Graphical Measures

24:01.900 --> 24:03.900
are not different

24:03.900 --> 24:05.900
from normal people.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.900
It is possible that

24:07.900 --> 24:09.900
Graphical Measures

24:09.900 --> 24:11.900
can be biomarkers.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.900
In fact,

24:13.900 --> 24:15.900
we have connected

24:15.900 --> 24:17.900
Graphical Measures

24:17.900 --> 24:19.900
to Cognitive Functions

24:19.900 --> 24:21.900
to show the difference

24:21.900 --> 24:23.900
between normal people

24:23.900 --> 24:25.900
and patients,

24:25.900 --> 24:27.900
so that

24:27.900 --> 24:29.900
we can connect

24:29.900 --> 24:31.900
the difference

24:31.900 --> 24:33.900
to Cognitive Functions.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.900
Ok,

24:35.900 --> 24:37.900
let's talk about

24:37.900 --> 24:39.900
Material Methods.

24:39.900 --> 24:41.900
We have two cohorts,

24:41.900 --> 24:43.900
PT and MS.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.900
PT and normal people.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.900
As for MS,

24:47.900 --> 24:49.900
when we were collecting data,

24:49.900 --> 24:51.900
normal people

24:51.900 --> 24:53.900
and patients

24:53.900 --> 24:55.900
are not age-matched,

24:55.900 --> 24:57.900
so I put all MS in

24:57.900 --> 24:59.900
to see if their measurements

24:59.900 --> 25:01.900
are related to Cognitive Functions.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.900
We call it

25:03.900 --> 25:05.900
Brain Behavior Analysis.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.900
In addition,

25:07.900 --> 25:09.900
we took 18 MS

25:09.900 --> 25:11.900
and 15 normal people

25:11.900 --> 25:13.900
to do a t-test

25:13.900 --> 25:15.900
to see if

25:15.900 --> 25:17.900
our measurements can be biomarkers.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.900
In addition,

25:19.900 --> 25:21.900
in terms of data,

25:21.900 --> 25:23.900
PT has

25:23.900 --> 25:25.900
Overall Cognition,

25:25.900 --> 25:27.900
which is a Modular Cognitive Assessment.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.900
In addition,

25:29.900 --> 25:31.900
there are tests for different Cognitive Domains,

25:31.900 --> 25:33.900
such as

25:33.900 --> 25:35.900
Visual Special Ability,

25:35.900 --> 25:37.900
Learning,

25:37.900 --> 25:39.900
Working Memory,

25:39.900 --> 25:41.900
Excitement Function, etc.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.900
In terms of MS,

25:43.900 --> 25:45.900
we can divide it into

25:45.900 --> 25:47.900
Working Memory,

25:47.900 --> 25:49.900
Processing Speed,

25:49.900 --> 25:51.900
and Excitement Function.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.900
At the same time,

25:53.900 --> 25:55.900
we also did a questionnaire

25:55.900 --> 25:57.900
to measure their

25:57.900 --> 25:59.900
Depression,

25:59.900 --> 26:01.900
Anxiety,

26:01.900 --> 26:03.900
and Fatigue.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.900
As I mentioned earlier,

26:05.900 --> 26:07.900
the most important thing in GraphQL

26:07.900 --> 26:09.900
is points and lines,

26:09.900 --> 26:11.900
i.e., ROI and Connection.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.900
We have 68 ROI here.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.900
As for Connection,

26:15.900 --> 26:17.900
after retrieving the FMR signal,

26:17.900 --> 26:19.900
we do Partial Correlation,

26:19.900 --> 26:21.900
which is

26:21.900 --> 26:23.900
Partial Correlation Matrix.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.900
Here,

26:25.900 --> 26:27.900
we consider it as Functional Connection,

26:27.900 --> 26:29.900
so we have points and lines,

26:29.900 --> 26:31.900
and we can do the following analysis.

26:31.900 --> 26:33.900
We use Brain Connectivity Toolbox

26:33.900 --> 26:35.900
to do Graph Theory.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.900
It is a free download of

26:37.900 --> 26:39.900
ManLab Toolbox.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.900
You can download it online.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.900
As for the GraphQL Majors,

26:43.900 --> 26:45.900
we can divide them into

26:45.900 --> 26:47.900
Global Majors and Nodal Majors.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.900
In Global Majors,

26:49.900 --> 26:51.900
there is a number

26:51.900 --> 26:53.900
for each subject.

26:53.900 --> 26:55.900
This number represents

26:55.900 --> 26:57.900
the characteristics of the brain

26:57.900 --> 26:59.900
globally.

26:59.900 --> 27:01.900
For example,

27:01.900 --> 27:03.900
Global Efficiency,

27:03.900 --> 27:05.900
Pathline,

27:05.900 --> 27:07.900
Rich Coop,

27:07.900 --> 27:09.900
Coefficient,

27:09.900 --> 27:11.900
Modularity,

27:11.900 --> 27:13.900
and so on.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.900
I won't go into details

27:15.900 --> 27:17.900
of each number.

27:17.900 --> 27:19.900
In short,

27:19.900 --> 27:21.900
they represent

27:21.900 --> 27:23.900
Functional Segregation

27:23.900 --> 27:25.900
and Functional Integration.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.900
Nodal Majors

27:27.900 --> 27:29.900
Here,

27:29.900 --> 27:31.900
I mainly use

27:31.900 --> 27:33.900
Betweenness Centrality

27:33.900 --> 27:35.900
and Local Efficiency.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.900
Betweenness Centrality

27:37.900 --> 27:39.900
represents that

27:39.900 --> 27:41.900
the higher the value,

27:41.900 --> 27:43.900
the more important

27:43.900 --> 27:45.900
the RRI is in the network.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.900
Local Efficiency

27:47.900 --> 27:49.900
represents that

27:49.900 --> 27:51.900
the higher the value,

27:51.900 --> 27:53.900
the higher the Functional Connectivity

27:53.900 --> 27:55.900
of the RRI.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.900
If the value is different

27:57.900 --> 27:59.900
in patients and in patients,

27:59.900 --> 28:01.900
it may become a biomarker.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.900
The so-called Brain Behavior Analysis

28:03.900 --> 28:05.900
uses correlation and regression

28:05.900 --> 28:07.900
to evaluate

28:07.900 --> 28:09.900
if these measures

28:09.900 --> 28:11.900
are related to cognition.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.900
Let's look at

28:13.900 --> 28:15.900
the results of PT.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.900
There are no differences

28:17.900 --> 28:19.900
in Global Majors.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.900
However, we find that

28:21.900 --> 28:23.900
Local Efficiency and Betweenness Centrality

28:23.900 --> 28:25.900
have significant differences.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.900
Let's look at the picture.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.900
This is the result of

28:29.900 --> 28:31.900
Local Efficiency on PT.

28:31.900 --> 28:33.900
You can see that

28:33.900 --> 28:35.900
there are a lot of

28:35.900 --> 28:37.900
dots on the right.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.900
Each dot represents

28:39.900 --> 28:41.900
an RRI.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.900
We have a total of 68 RRIs.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.900
These orange dots

28:45.900 --> 28:47.900
represent that

28:47.900 --> 28:49.900
these RRIs are actually

28:49.900 --> 28:51.900
increasing in PT.

28:51.900 --> 28:53.900
This is Local Efficiency.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.900
In PT,

28:55.900 --> 28:57.900
these RRIs

28:57.900 --> 28:59.900
actually increase

28:59.900 --> 29:01.900
their functional connectivity.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.900
It's a bit different from what we usually think.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.900
Let's look at

29:05.900 --> 29:07.900
Betweenness Centrality.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.900
These blue dots

29:09.900 --> 29:11.900
represent

29:11.900 --> 29:13.900
that their Betweenness Centrality

29:13.900 --> 29:15.900
is decreasing.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.900
In PT,

29:17.900 --> 29:19.900
these numbers are relatively low.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.900
RRIs like

29:21.900 --> 29:23.900
Superior Frontal Cortex

29:23.900 --> 29:25.900
or Parietal Cortex

29:25.900 --> 29:27.900
represent that

29:27.900 --> 29:29.900
these dots are

29:29.900 --> 29:31.900
the Hub Structure.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.900
In theory,

29:33.900 --> 29:35.900
these dots are very important.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.900
However, in PT,

29:37.900 --> 29:39.900
these RRIs

29:39.900 --> 29:41.900
are not that important.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.900
Interestingly,

29:43.900 --> 29:45.900
these two RRIs

29:45.900 --> 29:47.900
on the right are

29:47.900 --> 29:49.900
Local Clearance Accumbance.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.900
These two RRIs

29:51.900 --> 29:53.900
are more important in PT.

29:53.900 --> 29:55.900
Their Betweenness Centrality

29:55.900 --> 29:57.900
is higher.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.900
We think that

29:59.900 --> 30:01.900
this might be related to

30:01.900 --> 30:03.900
Compensation or Adaptation.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.900
We will explain it later.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.900
This is the result of t-test.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.900
In the next part of

30:09.900 --> 30:11.900
Brain Behavior Analysis,

30:11.900 --> 30:13.900
we will do Correlation and Linear Regression.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.900
I can tell you that

30:15.900 --> 30:17.900
you will not see any result.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.900
As for Correlation,

30:19.900 --> 30:21.900
there is an SDMT,

30:21.900 --> 30:23.900
Symbol Digital Modality Test.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.900
It mainly tests process speed.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.900
It is related to

30:27.900 --> 30:29.900
Global Efficiency and Pathline.

30:29.900 --> 30:31.900
Let's take a look at the graph.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.900
Let's take a look at this one.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.900
Global Efficiency

30:35.900 --> 30:37.900
The higher the number of Global Efficiency,

30:37.900 --> 30:39.900
the better the neural signal

30:39.900 --> 30:41.900
is integrated in the brain

30:41.900 --> 30:43.900
in different communities.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.900
Unexpectedly,

30:45.900 --> 30:47.900
the higher the number of Global Efficiency,

30:47.900 --> 30:49.900
the better the neural signal

30:49.900 --> 30:51.900
is integrated in the brain.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.900
It is related to

30:53.900 --> 30:55.900
poor cognitive performance.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.900
The graph on the right

30:57.900 --> 30:59.900
is related to

30:59.900 --> 31:01.900
Global Efficiency.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.900
The higher the number of

31:03.900 --> 31:05.900
Pathline,

31:05.900 --> 31:07.900
the lower the number of Global Efficiency.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.900
These two graphs

31:09.900 --> 31:11.900
tell us the same thing.

31:11.900 --> 31:13.900
The higher the number of

31:13.900 --> 31:15.900
Global Efficiency,

31:15.900 --> 31:17.900
the lower the neural signal

31:17.900 --> 31:19.900
is integrated in the brain.

31:19.900 --> 31:21.900
It is related to

31:21.900 --> 31:23.900
poor cognitive performance.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.900
Let's take a look at

31:25.900 --> 31:27.900
MS.

31:27.900 --> 31:37.900
MS

31:37.900 --> 31:39.900
MS

31:39.900 --> 31:41.900
MS

31:41.900 --> 31:43.900
MS

31:43.900 --> 31:45.900
MS

31:45.900 --> 31:47.900
MS

31:47.900 --> 31:49.900
MS

31:49.900 --> 31:51.900
MS

31:51.900 --> 31:53.900
MS

31:53.900 --> 31:55.900
MS

31:55.900 --> 31:57.900
MS

31:57.900 --> 31:59.900
MS

31:59.900 --> 32:01.900
MS

32:01.900 --> 32:03.900
MS

32:03.900 --> 32:05.900
MS

32:05.900 --> 32:07.900
MS

32:07.900 --> 32:09.900
MS

32:09.900 --> 32:11.900
MS

32:11.900 --> 32:13.900
MS

32:13.900 --> 32:15.900
MS

32:15.900 --> 32:17.900
MS

32:17.900 --> 32:19.900
MS

32:19.900 --> 32:21.900
MS

32:21.900 --> 32:23.900
MS

32:23.900 --> 32:25.900
MS

32:25.900 --> 32:27.900
MS
