00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
🦋 subs by bunbunruo 🦋

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Oh, he said the recording is on.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm the host for today, Zhang Lian-Ping.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
I just graduated last winter.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
I graduated from UNC and did research in social psychology.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I just graduated, so I'm a no-name now.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Before we start today's talk,

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
I'd like to introduce Project TIRA to you.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
As our website says,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
our goal is to build a timely,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
cross-national academic information sharing platform

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
to connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
to exchange academic results and trends in various fields

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
in the overseas and Taiwan academic circles,

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
and to provide a platform for effective communication.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
To put it simply,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
we want to build a platform

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
to help Taiwan researchers from all over the world

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
communicate with each other.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
We hold a weekly online video conference like this.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
The speakers are basically our members,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
and the topic is research results,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
field review,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
future development predictions,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
sharing new ideas,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
sharing new ideas,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
and opportunities for cooperation.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
TIRA is a fully self-funded,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
volunteer organization.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Our staff are mainly PhD students and post-doctorate students,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
or people like me,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
who is in the limbo between a PhD student and a post-doctorate student.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
You can see more details on our website.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
If you want to see more,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
you can go to our website.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
I think the key point of a project like this

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
is to have open cooperation and opportunities for sharing.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
The more people can join us and help each other,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
the stronger we will be,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
and the closer we will get to our goal.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
If you are interested,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
you are welcome to join our members

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
and support this idea

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
and share our research results.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
We also have a Facebook page,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
which I'm sure you all know.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
This is a non-profit platform

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
for sharing.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I hope you can support us.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
This is TIRA,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
and this is Housekeeping.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Let's get started.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Today's speaker is Joey Hsiao-Qiao Ying.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Joey graduated from the University of Michigan,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
and is now studying Information Science

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
at the University of Michigan.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
He will give a more in-depth introduction later,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
so I will be brief.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
What he is interested in

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
is how to use

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
new technology to help immigrants.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I think this is US immigrant,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
immigrants to the US.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
How to help them adapt

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
to the new society.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Then there is a website.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
If you are interested,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
you can check it out.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
It's beautiful.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
There are a lot of details

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
about his current projects,

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
presentations, papers, publications.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
I won't go into details today.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
What I find interesting

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
about this website is

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
that it says

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
he is a believer of the strength of weak ties.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
This is a background.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
If you don't know what a weak tie is,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
you should know what a strong tie is.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
A strong tie is a social relationship

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
we have since we are born.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Some people are your parents,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
some people are your children.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
You can't change this.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
You can't say no.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
By definition, they are your parents.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
But a weak tie is

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
when we are born,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
but we can make friends,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
find partners.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
This is in line with

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
the spirit of Tyra's research.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
It also says on the website

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
that he is a believer in weak ties.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
He likes to make new friends

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
and share his research opportunities.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
So please help him.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Give him a chance to make friends.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Without further ado,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
let's give the stage to Joey.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Let's give him a round of applause.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Thank you.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Give me 10 seconds.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I'll change something.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Okay, take your time.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I'll say something else.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Give me another 10 seconds.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Okay.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
If you have any questions,

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
you can leave them in the chat.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
You can leave them in the chat.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I don't know if Joey can do it.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
He might be watching his own video.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So he might not be able to see the chat.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
So leave them in the chat.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
He will look at your questions

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
and answer them.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
So you can use the chat.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Are you done?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Okay.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Are you done?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Do you have anything else to say?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
No, I'm done.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Okay.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm going to share my video.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Can you see the video?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yes.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Okay.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Hello, everyone.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm Joey.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Thank you for the introduction.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm a PhD candidate

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
at UMich.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm a PhD candidate

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
at UMich.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Today, I'm going to share

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
my research

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and my final dissertation.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm going to call it

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Not Only New Online,

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
but Also New Online.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Technology to Support Immigrant Access

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
to Social Capital Adaptation.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
What I'm going to talk about

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
is that

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
this research itself

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
is not yet designed

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
to help immigrants with new technology.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It's easier to adapt.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
The topic of today's talk

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
is still in the exploration stage.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
We are looking for their needs.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
What can we do

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
to promote

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
web design and app design

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
so that immigrants

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
can use technology more smoothly?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Let me talk about myself.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I just said

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
that I'm a PhD candidate

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
at UMich School of Information.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
My field is

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Human-Computer Interaction

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
We call it HCI and CSEW.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
HCI is

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Human-Computer Interaction.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
In short,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
we study how humans use technology,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
and how technology affects humans.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
We even discuss

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
how to influence human behavior

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
through design.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
We often combine psychology,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
human research,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
and product design

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
to develop a foundation.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You may have heard of

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
User Experience, UX,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
or Chinese User Experience.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
UX and HCI overlap a lot.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
The biggest difference is

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
HCI is usually used in academic research

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
to discuss

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
human-robot,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
human-technology.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
UX focuses on practical design

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
and emphasizes

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
how a product

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
can be used

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
on a commercial level

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
and how it can be used

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
through design.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
HCI also has

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Computer-Supported Cooperative Work,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
CSEW.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
CSEW focuses more on

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
human-to-human interaction

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
than traditional HCI

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
that focuses on

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
how technology affects

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
social,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
community,

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
and human-to-human performance.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
We often apply

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
social psychology

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
to our research.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
My research

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
focuses on

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
newcomers.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Newcomers are people

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
who have moved

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
or traveled

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
to a new place

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
for the first time.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
My research

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
focuses more on

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
immigrants,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
but I'm most interested in

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
the newcomers.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I often use

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
the concept of

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
social capital

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
in my research.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Social capital means

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
you have friends

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
and social connections.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
These social connections

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
can bring you

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
help and resources.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
This is social capital.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Facebook

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and other social media

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
have effectively

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
expanded

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
or enhanced

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
human social capital

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
and how people

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
can develop new social capital

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
and use social capital

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
to get new resources.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm interested in

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
social capital.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
The third area

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
is related to

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
location-based

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
social media.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I'm interested in

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
location-based social media

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
because

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
compared to

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
technology,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
location-based social media

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
can provide users

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
real-time information

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
and

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
provide users

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
real-time

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
social media

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
resources.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
These are

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
the three areas

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm interested in.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
These are

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
the three areas

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm interested in.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
This is

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
a conference

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I published

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
at CSCW

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
last year.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It's

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
technologies to

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
support immigration access

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
to social capital

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
and adaptation to

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
a new country.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Next slide.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Adaptation

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
focuses on

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
immigrants in the U.S.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Millions of immigrants

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
come to the U.S.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
for work, education

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
or their

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
dream in the U.S.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Immigration is not

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
an easy process.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Immigrants

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
need to make adjustments

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
to adapt

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
to the new environment.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
If adaptation fails,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
they will face

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
mental health

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
or employment

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
issues.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
In order to

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
successfully adapt,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
immigrants need

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
to meet

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
many needs.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
We compiled

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
four areas

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
in the past.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
The four needs

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
immigrants need to meet

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
are

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
first,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
they need to find

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
information

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and resources

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
to meet their basic

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
needs.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Second,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
they need to face

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
financial or

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
work issues.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
They need to find

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
a job.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Third,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
they need to

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
adapt to

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
a new culture

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and language.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Finally,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
immigrants need to

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
meet emotional needs

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
and

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
overcome

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
stress.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Looking back,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
social capital

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
includes

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
social connections,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
friends, family

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and neighbors.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
They can provide

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
resources through

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
social connections.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
In the past,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
social capital is

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
a very important

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
element in

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
immigration adaptation.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
In order to

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
develop a new

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
social capital in

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
a new country,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
immigration adaptation

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
is very important.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
In the past few years,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
people have said that

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
technology can help

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
immigrants develop

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
a new social capital

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and get

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
more resources.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Some studies

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
show that

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
immigrants adapt

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
to a new

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
culture and language

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
through technology.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
In the past,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
most studies

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
focused on people.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
In terms of technology,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
it is not enough

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
to study

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
how technology

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
can change

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
or design

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
a new society.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
My research

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
aims to

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
understand

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
how immigrants

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
can develop

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
a new society

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
through

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
technology.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
My research

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
aims to

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
understand

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
how

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
technology

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
can help

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
immigrants

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
develop

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
a new

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
social capital.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
What difficulties

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
immigrants face

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
through technology?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
What concerns

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
immigrants face?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
We have

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
designed a

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
qualitative study

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
to understand

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
immigrants.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Immigrants

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
come from

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
different backgrounds

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
and age.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
They come from

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
different backgrounds

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and age.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
We focus

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
on

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
voluntary immigrants.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
They are

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
volunteers.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
They are not

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
forced immigrants.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
They are not

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
forced immigrants

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
that we want to

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
focus on.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
They are

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
adults

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
who live alone.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
They are

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
adults

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
who live alone.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
They are

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
adults

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
who live alone.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
We focus

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
on

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
adults

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
who live alone.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
They are

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
adults

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
who live alone.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
We focus

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
on

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
adults

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
who live alone.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
We focus

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
on

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
