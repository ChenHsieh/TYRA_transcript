0	12000	Hello, I'm Ted. I'm very happy to be here today. I'd like to welcome Chen Junjia from the University of Amsterdam.
12000	17000	This is his last year at Pomeranian. Yay!
17000	24000	I've known him since he was in university. He's also a student at the Electrical Engineering Department.
24000	29000	I'm very happy to have someone with me to talk about physics.
29000	34000	Junjia is studying Atomic Physics.
34000	41000	I've done a little bit of it in the beginning, but it's a lot different from what I did in IELTS and BEC.
41000	45000	I think BEC is very cool in physics.
45000	54000	You've been in this field for over 20 years now, right? How long have you been in BEC?
54000	58000	It's been over 20 years since 1995.
58000	61000	Yeah, okay.
61000	66000	But it's been a long time since people wanted to do it. It was only made in 1995.
66000	77000	Junjia's topic for today is Steady-State Ultracold Cesium Near Quantum Degeneracy.
77000	84000	He's talking about the application in CW atom lasers and clocks.
84000	91000	His lab is one of the latest quantum flagships in Europe.
92000	101000	So maybe we can hear some new things and see what Europe plans to do in this area.
101000	107000	I won't say much more. Junjia, please get ready to start your speech.
107000	111000	Thank you.
111000	120000	First of all, I'd like to thank Jianyuan for giving me the opportunity to introduce the topic I'm doing.
120000	125000	First of all, I'd like to make a correction. What I'm doing is Strontium, not Cesium.
125000	130000	Strontium is a 2A element.
130000	138000	The purpose of our experiment is, as I said in the title, to achieve a steady-state.
138000	146000	In principle, the ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous atomic laser.
146000	156000	Of course, before you reach that ultimate goal, you have to reach the Bose-Einstein connection in the first phase.
156000	163000	This is something that hasn't been achieved yet.
163000	167000	In principle, our lab hopes to challenge it.
168000	173000	In principle, our lab hopes to challenge it.
173000	178000	As I mentioned in the title, the ultimate goal is to achieve a steady-state.
178000	184000	In principle, we are already very close to quantum degeneracy.
184000	187000	Of course, we haven't reached it yet.
187000	190000	But in principle, I will briefly report on our current progress.
190000	201000	Of course, I will also mention some applications of CW, Atom Laser, and CLOX on the technology we have developed.
201000	208000	The title is of course our lab, our overall experimental setup.
208000	210000	Let's take a look.
210000	220000	Of course, we have a step on the experiment.
220000	224000	In principle, we have used some of the cooling mechanisms of CISPOS.
224000	227000	I will briefly introduce it in the next speech.
227000	231000	First of all, this is the outline of my talk today.
231000	235000	I will briefly explain who we are, where we are, and why we want to do these things.
236000	243000	Next, I will briefly mention the technologies we use, such as laser cooling and BEC.
243000	251000	In principle, I will mention two applications that I am more interested in.
251000	256000	Atomic clock and atomic interferometer.
256000	260000	I will introduce STROMCM.
260000	270000	In principle, I will also introduce the so-called laser cooling STROMCM to Bose-SanSan condensate.
270000	280000	Next, I will introduce our entire experimental setup.
280000	290000	The three main results are, for example, Ultra High Phase Space Density MOD.
290000	298000	And how do we achieve the principle of Steady State Unity Phase Space Density.
298000	305000	Next, of course, I will introduce one of the cooling technologies we have developed, CISPOS Optical Lattice Decelerator.
305000	307000	Next, I will give Outlook.
307000	310000	First of all, let me introduce myself.
310000	314000	My master's thesis was originally done in Taiwan.
314000	317000	My master's thesis experiment.
317000	325000	In principle, my experiment is to achieve a full optical Rubidium Bose-SanSan condensate.
325000	332000	It is also because of this factor that I am interested in laser cooling.
332000	336000	So when I applied for a doctorate class,
336000	342000	Because when I was a soldier, the English exam preparation was not going well.
342000	346000	For example, I did not pass the TOEFL exam.
346000	348000	Then I thought I would come to Europe to do it.
348000	352000	At that time, I read some papers when I was studying in the master's class.
352000	358000	I know that there is a good team in Innsbruck, Australia.
359000	362000	At that time, I thought I would try to apply.
362000	366000	Then I applied to Rudy Green's lab.
366000	370000	At that time, the group I applied to was originally a strong team.
370000	373000	But then my little boss,
373000	376000	In principle, it is our actual boss, Florian.
376000	380000	He later applied for a teaching position to move to Amsterdam.
380000	382000	So I will come to Amsterdam to do it.
382000	386000	There is a very interesting historical source in Amsterdam.
386000	390000	This person is called Joke Worven.
390000	394000	In principle, at the beginning of BC,
394000	398000	When you want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation,
398000	402000	Ordinary people have not yet considered the elements of the EA group.
402000	406000	They want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation in hydrogen.
406000	410000	Joke Worven, in principle, his lab in Amsterdam
410000	413000	Is to do hydrogen cooling.
413000	415000	Then I want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation.
415000	418000	So, in principle, we have some in Amsterdam.
418000	422000	This kind of laser cooling historical source is right.
422000	426000	Of course, we moved from Australia to Amsterdam.
426000	430000	It's also a toss.
430000	436000	In principle, this is our good team in Amsterdam.
436000	440000	First of all, let me introduce what Bose-Einstein condensation is.
440000	443000	We all know that in principle, W1 material,
443000	447000	In principle, you can have the nature of the wave,
447000	449000	You can also have the nature of the particles.
449000	453000	Of course, it depends on your temperature conditions.
453000	457000	To determine some of the characteristics of your wave field.
457000	462000	Of course, we know that under higher temperature conditions,
462000	468000	In principle, O-nitrogen behaves more like a particle.
468000	470000	When the temperature drops,
470000	473000	The relationship between W1 and O-nitrogen tells you that
473000	475000	Its wavelength will gradually increase.
475000	478000	Then you start to use some fluctuations
478000	482000	To describe some of the behavior of your particles.
482000	486000	Of course, the closer you get to your condensation temperature,
486000	492000	The wavelength of your O-nitrogen starts to overlap.
492000	497000	Then you are more and more unable to tell the particles.
498000	501000	Finally, of course, in theory,
501000	504000	When T equals zero, you will reach a so-called
504000	507000	Bose-Einstein condensation state.
507000	518000	The picture is basically tested by the MIT team in 1997.
518000	520000	That is to say, they realized that
520000	525000	Let two Bose-Einstein condensations interfere.
525000	530000	In the experiment, of course, they first realized a Bose-Einstein condensation.
530000	533000	They divided an O-nitrogen into two.
533000	536000	So in the end, two Bose-Einstein condensations were formed.
536000	539000	Then they let it interfere.
539000	541000	Then you will see a very obvious
541000	544000	Interference of the particle wave.
544000	549000	After BC was realized,
549000	551000	First of all, it is a particle wave.
551000	553000	If it is a particle wave,
553000	556000	In the experiment, of course, they will think
556000	558000	It's like a laser.
558000	562000	They tried to achieve some
562000	567000	Demonstration of particle laser.
567000	569000	You can think of it as
569000	573000	In principle, it is an optical cavity.
573000	580000	All the atoms are in a so-called cavity mode.
580000	583000	You try to get this particle wave
583000	586000	After the particle wave comes out of the cavity,
586000	594000	In principle, they realized some of these particle lasers.
594000	599000	Of course, the current technology in the experiment
599000	603000	In principle, it can only achieve
603000	607000	There is no way to achieve a continuous particle laser.
607000	610000	In principle, you want to achieve a continuous particle laser.
610000	612000	Of course, you need some
612000	614000	You have to achieve some first.
614000	616000	First of all, you have to have a continuous BC.
616000	618000	To achieve a continuous BC,
618000	621000	You have to have some continuous cooling technology.
621000	623000	Continuous evaporative cooling
623000	627000	Or some continuous trap loading
627000	631000	In principle, many people in the past 20 years
631000	636000	Try to realize it.
636000	639000	Of course, in the end, they still haven't achieved
639000	643000	The ultimate goal is a continuous particle laser.
643000	649000	In principle, this is still a very difficult thing.
649000	651000	The reason why it is so difficult is because
651000	653000	For example, the conditions for BC to be realized
653000	657000	In principle, we all look at this so-called optical cavity density.
657000	659000	You can think of it as
659000	661000	For the water in the fish tank
661000	663000	Under low temperature conditions
663000	667000	It may have already thawed.
667000	674000	In principle, in the process of cooling
674000	677000	Its density conditions may already
677000	680000	There is no way to achieve the so-called
680000	683000	To achieve the state of BC condensation
683000	687000	First of all, we know that BC condensation
687000	689000	It has this optical cavity density
689000	692000	It has to reach the condition of greater than 2.6
692000	696000	Its degree of freedom depends on the relationship with temperature.
696000	699000	So we know that first of all, my density has to be high enough.
699000	701000	Then my temperature has to be low enough.
701000	705000	But under conditions of high density
705000	708000	Assuming that your density is too high
708000	712000	In principle, the atom will have a so-called
712000	714000	Loss mechanism
714000	717000	In principle, it is a so-called three-body recombination.
717000	719000	It will form molecules
719000	724000	In principle, it is a
724000	725000	Do you understand?
725000	728000	In principle, it is a loss mechanism.
728000	732000	We know that in principle
732000	734000	The density is almost on this scale.
734000	737000	It is 10 to the 14th square
737000	739000	So it means that your density cannot be too high.
739000	742000	If it is too high, your three-body recombination
742000	746000	In principle, your atoms will form molecules.
746000	749000	So your density is almost controlled at 10 to the 14th square.
749000	751000	That gives a contrast
751000	754000	In principle, in your air
754000	756000	In principle, your density is almost 10 to the 19th square.
756000	758000	So you can say
758000	761000	In principle, we are doing cold matter
761000	764000	When the cold atom is studied
764000	768000	The density of the atom group we are talking about
768000	770000	In principle, it is thin
770000	772000	It's 10 to the 14th square.
773000	776000	It's 10 to the 14th square.
776000	778000	To reach this Bc condition
778000	781000	Its corresponding temperature is almost at this level.
781000	784000	1μK to 10 nK level
784000	788000	This is a very cold principle.
788000	790000	That is to say
790000	792000	That's why it's called an ultracold atom.
792000	796000	Because it compares with other temperature scales.
796000	801000	Our cold atom is almost in this range.
801000	804000	Compared with other Earth's room temperature conditions
804000	806000	300K here
806000	810000	We are at about 7 or 8 numbers
810000	813000	A temperature condition below
813000	818000	The current realization
818000	822000	In principle, it is because of the restriction of cooling technology.
822000	825000	We can only achieve the so-called
825000	828000	The so-called Maltese-Boson condensation
828000	831000	You need to have the first stage of laser cooling in the experimental technology.
831000	833000	Then evaporate the cooling
833000	836000	When you reach Bc
836000	841000	You try to put the atom group inside
841000	843000	After the alcohol comes out
843000	845000	Of course, you will later
845000	849000	After using up the atom group in the trap
849000	852000	Then you have to do another experiment.
852000	854000	Re-create the Boson condensation
854000	857000	So on the experimental technology
857000	860000	You can only achieve the so-called Maltese-Boson condensation.
860000	864000	Of course, the continuous Boson condensation
864000	866000	Or continuous material laser
866000	869000	Has always been in the field
869000	871000	A goal that everyone wants to achieve
871000	874000	But even after 20 years of effort
874000	876000	There is still no way to achieve it.
876000	879000	Has not been achieved yet
879000	884000	Of course, we use laser cooling in the experiment.
884000	887000	Then I will briefly explain
887000	893000	Some mechanisms of laser cooling
893000	897000	First of all, the atom
897000	902000	First, we know that the atom interacts with the light.
902000	904000	Take a look
904000	905000	Sorry
908000	911000	First of all, the atom is electrically activated.
911000	915000	There is a principle
915000	917000	Resonant light
917000	922000	It absorbs a light corresponding to the quantum frequency.
922000	924000	The atom will be activated
924000	928000	Then there will be a transfer of momentum
928000	934000	Of course, after releasing the light back to the atom
934000	939000	There will be a transfer of momentum
939000	942000	The principle of laser cooling is based on this mechanism
942000	944000	To interact with the atom through light
944000	948000	To do a deceleration action
952000	954000	Of course on the experimental level
956000	957000	Through this mechanism
957000	961000	We want to take the atom from
961000	964000	For example, this is our source
965000	969000	You throw a piece of metal into the oven
969000	970000	Heat it up
970000	972000	It will be vaporized
972000	975000	Of course, vapor pressure corresponds to
975000	976000	For example, you heat it up
976000	980000	For example, on our experiment, we put it at 500 Kelvin.
980000	981000	So it's basically
981000	983000	Sorry, 500 degrees C
983000	985000	Then it will have a corresponding 500 degrees C
985000	990000	The speed distribution of Boltzmann distribution
990000	994000	How to interact with the atom through light
994000	998000	To decelerate this speed distribution
998000	1000000	In principle, on the experiment
1000000	1003000	We also use a so-called Zeeman Slower
1003000	1005000	Zeeman Slower is mainly through
1005000	1008000	Atomic under magnetic field conditions
1008000	1011000	It is a connection to the magnetic field
1011000	1015000	Change
1015000	1018000	On the principle of our laser
1018000	1020000	In the picture, you see the principle
1020000	1023000	On the experiment, we will go around a circle
1023000	1025000	Create a T-magnetic field
1025000	1027000	This T-magnetic field
1027000	1030000	It corresponds to
1030000	1035000	When my light and atom are in this position
1035000	1036000	Corresponding magnetic field
1036000	1038000	It creates
1038000	1040000	It meets the conditions
1040000	1042000	It interacts with the atom
1042000	1044000	It has a momentum shift
1044000	1046000	It decelerates
1046000	1048000	So the atom is decelerated
1048000	1049000	Then in the next position
1049000	1052000	Because my magnetic field has a T-magnetic field change
1052000	1055000	I'm in the next position
1055000	1057000	My magnetic field conditions
1057000	1059000	To find a way to maintain this
1059000	1062000	Light and atom interaction
1062000	1065000	Under constant conditions
1065000	1068000	My atom group
1068000	1070000	After this Zeeman Slower
1070000	1072000	After a deceleration
1072000	1075000	In principle, in the back
1075000	1077000	Can put my entire atom group
1077000	1079000	Its speed distribution
1079000	1083000	That is to say, a deceleration action
1083000	1085000	The principle of this experiment is
1085000	1087000	The overall experimental structure
1087000	1089000	For example, I have an oven
1089000	1092000	Is my heating
1092000	1094000	Heat the metal block
1094000	1096000	Area of ​​generating steam pressure
1096000	1101000	Then this is my Zeeman Slower
1101000	1103000	Then finally
1103000	1104000	I want to be in this place
1104000	1106000	Do a state of atom capture
1106000	1108000	This is just a general
1108000	1110000	A standard
1110000	1114000	A pulse-injection-like
1114000	1118000	I'm just making an example now
1118000	1124000	Let's take a look
1124000	1127000	In the experiment, of course, we finally
1127000	1130000	Is in
1130000	1132000	Do an atom capture
1132000	1135000	Let's take a look
1135000	1140000	Sorry, don't jump
1140000	1142000	That just said
1142000	1145000	After the atom capture
1145000	1147000	The technology used in the atom capture
1147000	1149000	For example, the last area
1149000	1152000	Will put the so-called six lasers
1152000	1153000	Six lasers in space
1153000	1155000	In principle, you can put
1155000	1157000	Atomic group in all directions
1157000	1159000	Do a deceleration action
1159000	1160000	Of course, in the experiment
1160000	1162000	We add a magnetic field
1162000	1165000	To be able to do a so-called
1165000	1167000	Spatial confinement
1167000	1169000	Then I'm here in principle
1169000	1190000	Just skip it first
1190000	1193000	In the principle of laser cooling
1193000	1194000	In the next step
1194000	1196000	It is necessary to enter the evaporation cooling
1196000	1198000	The reason is because
1198000	1200000	In the process of laser cooling
1200000	1204000	Your laser cooling will have a so-called
1204000	1206000	Laser cooling corresponds to a
1206000	1209000	Cooling temperature limit
1209000	1210000	The cooling temperature limit
1210000	1213000	Mainly you can understand it as
1213000	1216000	When all your atoms
1216000	1217000	After being cooled
1217000	1218000	It will get higher and higher
1218000	1222000	But because
1222000	1225000	You are absorbing the cooling light
1225000	1228000	The next step is to release the cooling light
1228000	1231000	Release a spontaneous emission
1231000	1233000	Then the light released
1233000	1236000	Because the density of the atomic group is very high now
1236000	1239000	It may be further
1239000	1243000	It's a bit like heating the atoms around you
1243000	1245000	The reason is because the density is very high now
1245000	1248000	So it corresponds to a
1248000	1250000	Laser cooling corresponds to a
1250000	1254000	Cooling temperature limit
1254000	1256000	So in principle
1256000	1259000	At the end of the experiment
1259000	1262000	After this laser cooling step
1262000	1265000	Will do an evaporation cooling action
1265000	1267000	The evaporation cooling action
1267000	1268000	General technology now
1268000	1270000	Of course there is the so-called magnetic field
1270000	1273000	Is to put the atomic group
1273000	1277000	Put it in a magnetic track
1277000	1279000	Or light
1279000	1283000	Did you use light in the experiment?
1283000	1285000	Let me explain a little bit
1285000	1288000	What is the overall mechanism of light?
1288000	1290000	We all know that the atom
1290000	1293000	There will be one in the power plant
1293000	1297000	Will be polarized
1297000	1299000	Then this
1299000	1302000	It will have a spontaneous
1302000	1303000	Electric dipole
1303000	1305000	In principle
1305000	1308000	Suppose I use light today
1308000	1310000	To produce a so-called
1310000	1312000	AC electric field
1312000	1314000	Then my atom in principle
1314000	1316000	Will be
1316000	1319000	Induced dipole moment
1319000	1323000	In principle, its power plant is produced by light
1323000	1326000	Then he knows
1326000	1328000	Because of this
1328000	1330000	In the light field
1330000	1332000	Its dipole moment
1332000	1334000	In principle, it will
1334000	1336000	Because of the power plant
1336000	1338000	Sorry
1339000	1341000	For example, we are using light now
1341000	1342000	To produce a light field
1342000	1344000	That light field because
1344000	1346000	In principle, the light field
1346000	1349000	I produce this
1349000	1351000	Trap his
1351000	1354000	It is determined by its intensity
1354000	1356000	That is to say, I assume
1356000	1358000	Today light is a Gaussian beam
1358000	1361000	It has an intensity distribution
1361000	1363000	In principle
1363000	1365000	This dipole moment
1365000	1367000	To induce
1367000	1369000	In this light field
1369000	1372000	For this intensity distribution
1372000	1374000	You will have the so-called
1374000	1377000	Assuming
1377000	1379000	The atom is in the light field
1379000	1381000	Suppose I have this light today
1381000	1382000	For it
1382000	1385000	If I am a
1385000	1386000	Redshift
1386000	1387000	It means
1387000	1389000	I assume my wavelength
1389000	1392000	Than the wavelength of the light I use
1392000	1395000	If the wavelength of my atomic quantum frequency
1395000	1396000	If it's still long
1396000	1398000	We call it
1398000	1400000	In principle, it is called
1400000	1401000	In this light
1401000	1402000	In principle
1402000	1404000	This light field is called
1404000	1406000	Red Dipole Trap
1406000	1408000	Red Dipole Trap
1408000	1410000	In principle, it is said
1410000	1412000	My atom will be concentrated
1412000	1415000	To a higher intensity
1415000	1417000	Area
1417000	1418000	Compared to
1418000	1421000	Assuming the wavelength of the light I use today
1421000	1424000	If the wavelength is still short
1424000	1426000	The overall
1426000	1428000	The characteristic of the light produced is that
1428000	1431000	My atom will be concentrated
1431000	1435000	The lower part of the intensity
1435000	1439000	That
1439000	1441000	Just a little bit here
1441000	1443000	Demonstrate
1443000	1444000	Atomic group
1444000	1447000	Some interactions with light
1447000	1449000	In the experiment, of course, we are
1449000	1452000	After generating the so-called magnetic light
1452000	1454000	Open my Red Dipole Trap
1454000	1455000	Then it is
1455000	1457000	In principle
1457000	1459000	You will see
1459000	1460000	The atomic group is
1460000	1462000	Leaked into the Red Dipole Trap
1462000	1465000	That
1465000	1467000	This is just to show that
1467000	1469000	After opening the Red Dipole Trap
1469000	1471000	I go
1471000	1475000	That is
1475000	1477000	Just open
1478000	1479000	0 ms
1479000	1480000	10 ms
1480000	1481000	20 ms
1481000	1482000	That my atomic group
1482000	1483000	One
1483000	1484000	Atomic group
1484000	1486000	Leaked into the Red Dipole Trap
1486000	1488000	One
1488000	1491000	Behavior like this
1491000	1493000	In the experiment, of course, we reached
1493000	1495000	That is to say, the atomic group
1495000	1497000	Leaked into the light
1497000	1499000	Then we need to evaporate and cool in the light
1499000	1501000	That evaporate and cool
1501000	1503000	The concept is very simple
1503000	1505000	After the hot atom leaves
1505000	1506000	Overall
1506000	1508000	The remaining atoms will go through again
1508000	1509000	One
1509000	1511000	Thermalization process
1511000	1512000	At the end
1512000	1514000	Of course, the overall temperature will drop
1514000	1517000	That
1517000	1518000	Evaporate and cool
1518000	1519000	Next
1519000	1520000	Evaporate and cool
1520000	1521000	When the temperature is getting lower and lower
1521000	1523000	After reaching the critical temperature
1523000	1525000	You will see one
1525000	1526000	Atomic group
1526000	1527000	The process of phase transformation
1527000	1528000	That
1528000	1529000	Here
1529000	1530000	Is a
1530000	1531000	At the end
1531000	1532000	Evaporate and cool
1532000	1533000	Then the radiation freezes
1533000	1534000	One
1534000	1535000	This is a whole
1535000	1536000	A phase transformation
1536000	1538000	One
1538000	1541000	Demonstration
1541000	1542000	That
1542000	1543000	In
1543000	1545000	Evaporate and cool
1545000	1548000	He
1548000	1550000	How do you judge
1550000	1552000	Your substance has passed
1552000	1553000	Is already
1553000	1555000	Reached the evaporation and cooling state
1555000	1556000	That
1556000	1558000	In the experiment, we will
1558000	1559000	Through
1559000	1560000	Uh
1560000	1561000	For example, I am looking at this
1561000	1562000	Atomic group behavior
1562000	1563000	That
1563000	1564000	For example, we are now
1564000	1565000	Here is the
1565000	1567000	Uh release
1567000	1569000	Then the atomic group will be in the gravity field
1569000	1571000	It will fall under the conditions
1571000	1572000	That
1572000	1574000	Let's do an image action
1574000	1575000	That
1575000	1576000	Atomic group
1576000	1577000	In principle, it assumes
1577000	1579000	If it is still thermal gas
1579000	1581000	He is in
1581000	1583000	Uh
1583000	1584000	You will see that in principle it is a
1584000	1587000	Isotropic expansion
1587000	1588000	One behavior
1588000	1589000	That
1589000	1590000	Assuming he is today
1590000	1592000	If it reaches the evaporation and cooling state
1592000	1594000	That
1594000	1596000	In principle, you will see a
1596000	1597000	So-called
1597000	1598000	Anisotropic
1598000	1600000	Expansion behavior
1600000	1602000	That this is with
1602000	1604000	You can understand it
1604000	1605000	That is to say
1605000	1606000	Uh
1606000	1607000	For example, if you have a
1607000	1608000	Elongated
1608000	1609000	Cloud
1609000	1610000	That in
1610000	1612000	He is in
1612000	1614000	After you release the
1614000	1616000	He is in the gravity field
1616000	1617000	Falling
1617000	1618000	That
1618000	1620000	He was originally
1620000	1621000	Strong
1621000	1623000	Strong confinement
1623000	1624000	On the axis
1624000	1626000	His
1626000	1628000	He is stronger
1628000	1629000	So he will
1629000	1631000	In the process of release
1631000	1633000	In principle, it will grow faster
1633000	1635000	He will have
1635000	1636000	It also leads to
1636000	1637000	He will have this
1637000	1638000	So-called
1638000	1639000	Anisotropic expansion
1639000	1640000	A phenomenon
1640000	1641000	That this is
1641000	1642000	In principle, our
1642000	1643000	A smoking gun
1643000	1644000	That is to say
1644000	1645000	As long as we have reached BC
1645000	1647000	That in principle
1647000	1649000	We are going to
1649000	1650000	Find this
1650000	1652000	Anisotropic expansion
1652000	1653000	To determine that we have reached
1653000	1655000	The state of BC
1655000	1656000	That of course
1656000	1658000	1995
1658000	1660000	BC was realized for the first time
1660000	1661000	That
1661000	1662000	Next
1662000	1663000	In 2001
1663000	1665000	I got the Nobel Prize
1665000	1666000	That
1666000	1667000	So far
1667000	1668000	Uh
1668000	1669000	Someone
1669000	1670000	Have a question
1670000	1671000	Want to ask
1671000	1672000	That is to say
1672000	1673000	I'm just a little bit
1673000	1675000	Laser cooling
1675000	1676000	That
1676000	1677000	So far
1677000	1678000	Someone has a question
1678000	1679000	Hello
1679000	1680000	Hello
1680000	1681000	I want to ask
1681000	1682000	That
1682000	1683000	You will be sure
1683000	1684000	It's you
1684000	1685000	Inside this
1685000	1686000	Or your BC
1686000	1687000	How many
1687000	1688000	Or how many
1688000	1689000	For you
1689000	1690000	Because
1690000	1691000	Sometimes there will be
1691000	1692000	He is like
1692000	1693000	His number should be
1693000	1694000	It's all changing
1694000	1695000	Uh
1695000	1696000	Uh
1696000	1697000	So
1697000	1698000	I
1698000	1699000	I
1699000	1700000	I
1700000	1701000	I
1701000	1702000	I
1702000	1703000	I
1703000	1704000	I
1704000	1705000	I
1705000	1706000	I
1706000	1707000	I
1707000	1708000	Uh
1708000	1709000	Uh
1709000	1710000	Uh
1710000	1711000	Of course
1711000	1712000	We experiment
1712000	1714000	For example, you see this picture now
1714000	1715000	That we are
1715000	1716000	Do
1716000	1717000	Uh
1717000	1718000	Assortment imaging
1718000	1719000	It's basically
1719000	1720000	To go back
1720000	1722000	How many of its atoms are there
1722000	1723000	Like this
1723000	1724000	This picture
1724000	1725000	Uh
1725000	1726000	Uh
1726000	1727000	Of course I can't guess now
1727000	1728000	But
1728000	1729000	Almost
1729000	1730000	Look at this condition
1730000	1732000	There are about 10 5-quarters
1732000	1733000	10 6-quarters
1733000	1735000	The number of atoms
1736000	1737000	On the experiment
1737000	1738000	Of course we will
1738000	1739000	Will calculate
1739000	1740000	But
1740000	1741000	Uh
1741000	1742000	For example, we are now on the experiment
1742000	1744000	I want to reach the continuous Bohr's law
1744000	1746000	Can be imagined
1746000	1747000	At the beginning
1747000	1749000	The number you reach
1749000	1750000	Not so much
1750000	1751000	It's possible
1751000	1752000	10 3-quarters
1752000	1753000	10 4-quarters
1753000	1754000	So
1754000	1755000	But he has a corresponding condition
1755000	1756000	That is to say
1757000	1758000	Uh
1758000	1759000	The number
1759000	1760000	Also with your
1760000	1761000	The temperature of the ring
1761000	1763000	It has something to do
1763000	1764000	That is to say
1764000	1766000	You have to reach
1766000	1767000	So many
1767000	1768000	Uh
1768000	1769000	Bohr's law
1769000	1770000	Your
1772000	1774000	You have a corresponding ring temperature
1774000	1775000	That's right
1775000	1776000	So
1776000	1777000	On our experiment
1777000	1778000	Of course, we have to find a way
1779000	1781000	Condition
1781000	1782000	That is to say
1782000	1783000	I want my system to be able to
1783000	1785000	Cold to such a low temperature
1785000	1786000	That
1786000	1787000	At that temperature
1787000	1789000	How much density do I have to reach
1789000	1790000	To have a way
1790000	1791000	To cross that
1791000	1793000	Condition of phase space density
1793000	1794000	Greater than 2
1794000	1795000	That is
1795000	1796000	Uh
1797000	1799000	N lambda 3-quarters
1799000	1800000	Greater than 2.6
1800000	1801000	This condition
1801000	1802000	In principle
1802000	1803000	I'm going to adjust this
1803000	1804000	Density
1804000	1805000	With temperature
1805000	1806000	That whole person
1806000	1807000	To have this
1807000	1809000	Satisfy this condition
1809000	1810000	I have a way to
1810000	1812000	To reach the Bohr's law
1812000	1813000	So
1813000	1814000	Uh
1814000	1815000	I don't know if this answers your question
1819000	1820000	Hey, it's okay
1820000	1821000	You go ahead
1821000	1822000	We
1822000	1824000	I have some questions later
1824000	1825000	I'll ask you again
1826000	1827000	OK
1827000	1828000	Technical questions
1828000	1829000	I'll ask you again
1829000	1830000	Hey, hello
1830000	1831000	That one
1831000	1832000	The one in the first video
1832000	1833000	It's gone
1833000	1834000	It's your head now
1835000	1836000	Oh really
1837000	1838000	Hey
1838000	1839000	Do you see your desktop
1839000	1841000	Or am I seeing yours now
1841000	1842000	OK
1842000	1843000	I see
1843000	1844000	It's okay to continue
1844000	1845000	OK
1846000	1847000	Uh, I have a question
1847000	1848000	Let me introduce us
1848000	1849000	That
1849000	1850000	OK
1850000	1851000	Uh, sorry
1851000	1852000	I just want to ask
1852000	1853000	That is
1854000	1855000	Uh
1855000	1856000	What is it called
1856000	1857000	That is
1857000	1858000	You want to produce
1858000	1859000	CW
1859000	1860000	The
1860000	1861000	Bose Einstein Converter
1861000	1862000	That is
1862000	1863000	You can let that Bose Einstein Converter
1863000	1864000	Keep going
1864000	1865000	So
1865000	1866000	My question is
1866000	1867000	That is
1867000	1868000	Under what circumstances
1868000	1869000	That is
1869000	1870000	Under what circumstances
1870000	1871000	Why won't it last
1873000	1874000	OK
1874000	1875000	How long does it last
1875000	1876000	How long
1880000	1882000	Let me find the video
1906000	1907000	Uh
1907000	1908000	How long
1916000	1917000	In principle
1917000	1918000	On top of time
1918000	1919000	Is
1923000	1924000	You mean
1924000	1925000	It has an infinite duration
1925000	1926000	What I just said
1926000	1927000	It has an infinite duration
1927000	1928000	It has an infinite duration
1928000	1929000	It has a time limit
1929000	1930000	It has a time limit
1930000	1931000	That time limit
1931000	1932000	That time limit
1932000	1933000	Yes yes
1933000	1935000	Yes, that's right
1935000	1936000	That time limit
1936000	1937000	In principle
1937000	1939000	It depends on your experimental technology
1939000	1941000	You have to go through the laser cooling first
1941000	1944000	And then the next step
1944000	1945000	Evaporate and cool
1945000	1947000	Finally reach the Boltzmann fission
1947000	1949000	That
1949000	1950000	But in principle
1950000	1951000	Your entire system
1951000	1952000	You will have a
1952000	1954000	Uh
1954000	1955000	Loss
1955000	1957000	Or you're doing atom
1957000	1958000	Outcouple your atom
1958000	1960000	Outcouple your atom from your BC
1960000	1961000	After your atom comes out
1961000	1962000	That you
1962000	1963000	In the end
1963000	1965000	You still use up all the atoms
1965000	1966000	So that means
1966000	1967000	You're in the experiment
1967000	1969000	Re-create the Boltzmann fission
1969000	1972000	So that's because of this
1972000	1974000	Restriction, so
1974000	1975000	In the experiment
1975000	1976000	You will
1976000	1977000	You
1977000	1978000	Your Boltzmann fission
1978000	1980000	Or your atom laser
1980000	1981000	Is
1981000	1982000	There will be a
1982000	1984000	Uh
1984000	1985000	It's a soldering
1985000	1987000	Because you're going to run out of atoms
1987000	1988000	That experiment
1988000	1989000	Is to achieve
1989000	1990000	That is to say
1990000	1991000	Continuous
1991000	1992000	That is to say
1992000	1993000	Your Boltzmann fission
1993000	1994000	Continuous
1994000	1995000	Boltzmann fission
1995000	1996000	Continuous
1996000	1997000	That side
1997000	1998000	That is to say
1998000	1999000	He basically
1999000	2001000	Assuming I
2001000	2002000	If I keep
2002000	2003000	What do you mean
2003000	2004000	If it's
2004000	2005000	That is
2005000	2006000	That usually we
2006000	2007000	The last step is
2007000	2008000	Outcouple
2008000	2009000	That BEC
2009000	2010000	Then you can measure
2010000	2011000	Correct
2011000	2012000	That if
2012000	2013000	You keep outcoupling
2013000	2015000	That BEC
2015000	2016000	Just
2016000	2019000	Won't it be there all the time
2019000	2020000	Uh
2020000	2021000	Is because
2021000	2022000	You have to know
2022000	2023000	In vacuum
2023000	2024000	He still has a so-called
2024000	2025000	Background collision
2025000	2026000	He
2026000	2027000	Your
2027000	2028000	You have a BEC
2028000	2029000	He's in
2029000	2030000	Under vacuum
2030000	2031000	In your
2031000	2032000	Inside the trap
2032000	2034000	He will still
2034000	2035000	There is a
2035000	2036000	Background collision
2036000	2038000	A loss caused
2038000	2039000	In principle
2039000	2040000	You can imagine
2040000	2041000	His lifetime
2041000	2042000	In principle
2042000	2043000	Under the best vacuum condition
2043000	2044000	In principle
2044000	2046000	It's about 30 seconds
2046000	2047000	Uh
2047000	2048000	After 30 seconds
2048000	2049000	Your atom
2049000	2050000	In principle
2050000	2051000	After a series of
2051000	2052000	Background collision
2052000	2053000	In the end
2053000	2054000	It's gone
2054000	2055000	So
2055000	2056000	On the experiment
2056000	2057000	You have to start again
2057000	2058000	Re-create
2058000	2059000	A wave
2059000	2060000	Out of vacuum
2060000	2061000	So
2061000	2062000	OK
2062000	2063000	Yes
2063000	2064000	There is a
2064000	2065000	Background collision
2065000	2066000	Result in
2066000	2067000	You have a whole
2067000	2068000	A loss
2068000	2069000	Uh
2069000	2070000	OK
2070000	2071000	Good to know
2071000	2072000	it is good
2072000	2073000	Thank you
2073000	2074000	That
2074000	2075000	On the experiment
2075000	2076000	We are doing strong
2076000	2077000	Strong
2077000	2078000	With
2109000	2110000	Uh
2110000	2111000	Different elements of the 2A group
2111000	2112000	Of course, he has two
2112000	2113000	Add electrons
2113000	2114000	That
2114000	2116000	It corresponds to the electronic connection
2116000	2118000	Different from the 1A group
2118000	2119000	In
2120000	2121000	He has so-called
2121000	2122000	Singlet
2122000	2123000	With triplet states
2123000	2124000	That
2124000	2126000	First of all, we all know
2126000	2128000	In the 1A group
2128000	2130000	You make these atomic keys
2130000	2131000	That is
2131000	2133000	In principle
2133000	2134000	He will meet
2134000	2135000	Some so-called
2135000	2136000	Selection rule
2137000	2138000	That
2138000	2140000	In the 2A group
2140000	2142000	Because he has a triplet state
2142000	2143000	That
2143000	2145000	Atomic keys from singlet to triplet state
2145000	2146000	In principle
2147000	2148000	Not satisfied
2148000	2150000	Selection rule
2150000	2151000	That is to say your
2151000	2152000	Delta s
2152000	2154000	Not equal to 0
2154000	2155000	In principle
2156000	2157000	This is
2157000	2158000	Selection rule
2158000	2160000	Not allowed
2160000	2162000	But of course
2162000	2163000	Because
2163000	2164000	Some
2164000	2165000	Coincidence mechanism
2165000	2166000	For example
2167000	2168000	For example
2168000	2170000	In this 3P state
2172000	2173000	He
2174000	2175000	He and
2175000	2176000	This state
2176000	2177000	1P1
2177000	2178000	In principle, there is a coincidence
2178000	2179000	That
2179000	2180000	In principle
2180000	2181000	He will indirectly
2181000	2182000	With
2182000	2183000	Ground state couple
2183000	2184000	To
2184000	2185000	So he
2185000	2186000	Overall
2186000	2187000	This key
2187000	2188000	He
2188000	2189000	Still allowed
2190000	2191000	That
2191000	2192000	But the answer he corresponds to is
2192000	2193000	Because he
2193000	2194000	Uh
2195000	2197000	He corresponds to the key
2198000	2199000	Is allowed
2199000	2201000	But he corresponds to the width of the line
2201000	2202000	Relatively narrow
2203000	2204000	That
2205000	2206000	This is
2206000	2208000	A level scheme of strong
2208000	2209000	Then we see
2209000	2210000	For example
2212000	2213000	In
2214000	2215000	First left is
2215000	2216000	Singlet state
2217000	2218000	Right is triplet state
2219000	2220000	That
2221000	2222000	Singlet state inside
2222000	2223000	This
2223000	2224000	This
2224000	2225000	Is what we use
2225000	2226000	Mainly laser cooling
2226000	2227000	He corresponds to the width of the line
2227000	2228000	In principle, it is
2228000	2229000	30.5 MHz
2230000	2231000	That
2231000	2233000	Triplet state is our second stage
2233000	2234000	Laser cooling key
2234000	2235000	That
2235000	2236000	His line is relatively narrow
2237000	2238000	That
2238000	2239000	Because I just mentioned
2239000	2240000	Is
2240000	2241000	He
2242000	2243000	Selection rule
2243000	2244000	This is a
2244000	2245000	Forbidden transition
2245000	2246000	But
2246000	2247000	He
2247000	2248000	In principle, it is
2249000	2250000	He corresponds to
2250000	2251000	In principle, he
2251000	2252000	In principle
2253000	2254000	Not completely forbidden
2254000	2255000	So he corresponds to
2255000	2256000	Is a
2256000	2257000	Transition of the width of the line
2258000	2259000	He corresponds to the width of the line
2259000	2260000	Transition
2260000	2262000	He is on the laser cooling
2263000	2264000	Allow you to reach
2265000	2266000	Lower
2266000	2267000	Cooling limit
2268000	2269000	So
2269000	2270000	Use this
2270000	2271000	Uh
2271000	2272000	To do laser cooling
2273000	2274000	He can reach
2274000	2275000	A lower temperature
2276000	2277000	That
2277000	2278000	He has some
2279000	2280000	Features
2280000	2281000	This
2281000	2282000	Metastable state
2282000	2283000	I will introduce later
2283000	2284000	I am
2284000	2285000	We use it
2285000	2286000	For example
2286000	2287000	Uh
2287000	2288000	In general
2288000	2289000	Poisson
2289000	2290000	Poisson
2290000	2291000	Inside
2291000	2292000	He can be used
2292000	2294000	Accumulate my atomic group
2294000	2295000	That is to say this is a
2295000	2296000	Lifetime
2296000	2297000	Long
2297000	2298000	State
2298000	2299000	I can put the atom
2299000	2300000	In principle
2300000	2301000	Concentrated in this state
2301000	2302000	To do
2302000	2303000	Uh
2303000	2304000	Accumulated action
2304000	2305000	That
2305000	2306000	His
2306000	2307000	Ground state
2307000	2308000	Mentioned here is that
2308000	2309000	No
2309000	2310000	Magnetic
2310000	2311000	Magnetic
2311000	2312000	No
2312000	2313000	Electronic
2313000	2314000	Magnetic Moment
2314000	2315000	So
2315000	2316000	My
2316000	2317000	Atomic atom
2317000	2318000	Originally in
2319000	2320000	I can't use
2320000	2321000	Because he doesn't have
2321000	2322000	Magnetic Moment
2322000	2323000	So I can't use
2323000	2325000	Magnetic to capture him
2325000	2327000	Also limited to say
2327000	2328000	Is
2328000	2329000	I have to use light in the experiment
2329000	2330000	Instead of magnetic
2331000	2332000	That
2332000	2333000	This is the reason
2333000	2334000	He doesn't have
2334000	2335000	Magnetic
2335000	2336000	Magnetic Moment
2339000	2340000	That
2340000	2341000	Current stage
2342000	2343000	Strong
2343000	2344000	The experiment
2344000	2345000	In principle
2345000	2346000	Uh
2346000	2347000	I'm here
2347000	2348000	There are many principles
2348000	2349000	For example
2349000	2350000	Ultra cold
2350000	2351000	Inside the atom
2351000	2352000	Want to
2352000	2353000	We have it in the lab
2353000	2354000	For example
2354000	2355000	We want to do
2355000	2356000	Ground state
2356000	2357000	That
2357000	2358000	There is also a strong
2358000	2359000	Two molecules
2359000	2360000	And
2360000	2361000	For example
2361000	2362000	Now
2362000	2363000	Very
2363000	2364000	Red
2364000	2365000	For example
2365000	2366000	Quantum gas microscope
2366000	2367000	Want to
2367000	2368000	In principle
2368000	2369000	We want to do
2369000	2370000	High resolution
2370000	2371000	That is to say
2371000	2373000	High resolution on the experiment
2373000	2374000	One
2374000	2375000	Uh
2375000	2377000	To observe the atomic group
2377000	2378000	Some
2379000	2380000	Uh
2380000	2381000	Experiment
2381000	2382000	Or say
2382000	2383000	For example
2383000	2385000	Use magnetic atoms to do atomic interference
2385000	2386000	And
2386000	2387000	The next thing I'm going to introduce is
2388000	2390000	Use magnetic atoms to do superradiant laser
2390000	2391000	That
2393000	2394000	There are many
2395000	2396000	That
2396000	2397000	I'm more interested in
2397000	2398000	For example
2398000	2399000	Let's do the atomic group
2399000	2400000	That
2400000	2401000	We all know now
2401000	2402000	Atomic group
2402000	2403000	Now use color atoms
2403000	2404000	To do
2404000	2405000	That
2405000	2406000	Uh
2406000	2407000	Time definition
2407000	2408000	That
2408000	2409000	In fact, this is with color atoms
2409000	2410000	Hyper
2410000	2411000	Uh
2411000	2412000	Ground state
2412000	2413000	Hyperfine state
2413000	2414000	To do a
2414000	2415000	Uh
2415000	2416000	Time standard
2416000	2417000	That
2417000	2418000	Color atoms
2418000	2419000	Ground state
2419000	2420000	Hyperfine state
2420000	2421000	Transition
2421000	2422000	Almost
2422000	2423000	In
2423000	2424000	Uh
2424000	2425000	Gigahertz level
2425000	2426000	It seems
2426000	2427000	There are
2427000	2429000	More than nine gigahertz
2430000	2431000	That
2432000	2433000	Of course
2433000	2435000	We all know that
2435000	2436000	Some of it
2436000	2437000	Uh
2437000	2438000	Then I'm on the right side
2438000	2440000	A list of
2440000	2442000	Relationship
2442000	2443000	We know that this
2443000	2444000	His
2445000	2446000	Accuracy
2446000	2447000	In principle
2447000	2448000	Is with
2448000	2449000	Screen
2449000	2450000	His uncertainty
2450000	2452000	Is related to his frequency
2452000	2453000	That
2453000	2454000	From this relationship
2454000	2455000	We know that
2456000	2457000	Your center frequency
2457000	2458000	For example
2458000	2459000	Ccm
2459000	2460000	It corresponds to
2460000	2462000	The frequency is in the gigahertz level
2462000	2463000	That
2463000	2465000	Of course they are on the time
2465000	2466000	I hope to put this frequency
2466000	2468000	The higher the higher the better
2468000	2469000	Because
2469000	2470000	This way
2470000	2471000	This one
2471000	2472000	His
2473000	2474000	The error can be
2474000	2475000	Or
2475000	2476000	His
2476000	2478000	Uncertainty can be smaller
2478000	2480000	Because you imagine
2480000	2481000	For example
2481000	2482000	I put
2482000	2484000	He from gigahertz
2484000	2485000	Back to
2485000	2486000	Terahertz
2487000	2488000	That
2488000	2489000	This one
2489000	2491000	The denominator is super big
2491000	2493000	That he overall
2493000	2494000	I
2494000	2495000	Error of hertz
2495000	2497000	Corresponding to an uncertainty
2497000	2498000	His
2498000	2500000	Fraction is smaller
2500000	2501000	That
2501000	2503000	In addition, we know that the number is in principle
2503000	2505000	The more atoms, the better
2506000	2508000	That's why the experiment
2508000	2510000	The glasses are in the light
2510000	2511000	This piece
2511000	2513000	They want to go from gigahertz
2513000	2514000	To
2514000	2515000	Light to push
2515000	2517000	Push to terahertz
2517000	2519000	That of course
2519000	2521000	Uh, the first one
2521000	2523000	Light
2523000	2525000	The candidate is, for example, ion trap
2525000	2527000	Because ion, for example, ion
2527000	2528000	He has some
2528000	2530000	Ion corresponds to
2530000	2532000	Uh, for example, clock transition
2532000	2534000	That is to say, you can
2534000	2536000	Uh
2536000	2538000	He corresponds to the clock transition
2538000	2540000	Can be used as your time standard
2540000	2541000	But
2541000	2542000	Uh
2542000	2544000	Uh
2544000	2546000	The first generation of ion trap, of course
2546000	2548000	He trapped an ion
2548000	2550000	So in this number
2550000	2552000	He is relatively
2552000	2553000	Weak
2553000	2554000	That's why
2554000	2555000	In
2555000	2558000	The new generation, of course, other people have other proposals
2558000	2560000	For example, to do optical lattice clock
2560000	2562000	Of course he is
2562000	2564000	The more traps, the better the atoms
2564000	2566000	That optical lattice clock
2566000	2568000	He also uses atoms
2568000	2570000	Also use the atomic clock state
2570000	2572000	In terahertz level
2572000	2574000	And then he has to trap a lot of atoms at the same time
2574000	2576000	Go to this
2576000	2578000	Pull up
2578000	2580000	That overall makes the whole
2580000	2582000	Uh
2582000	2584000	The accuracy is higher
2584000	2586000	That
2586000	2588000	So state of the art
2588000	2590000	Of course it is
2590000	2592000	The night army in Gila
2592000	2594000	What he achieved now, of course, is
2594000	2596000	The Fermi gas clock
2596000	2598000	Uh, Fermi gas clock
2598000	2600000	That of course
2600000	2602000	His this
2602000	2604000	Now on the experiment
2604000	2606000	Uh, the principle is
2606000	2608000	Almost at 10 to 18
2608000	2610000	10 to 18
2610000	2612000	Of course this is
2612000	2614000	This is listed here
2614000	2616000	The night army
2616000	2618000	He
2618000	2620000	In his speech, it is often mentioned that
2620000	2622000	Assuming that he can achieve it in today's experiment
2622000	2624000	One
2624000	2626000	Uh, Fermi gas principle is
2626000	2628000	There are 1 million atoms
2628000	2630000	That his
2630000	2632000	Uh, he has a way to reach this
2632000	2634000	Uh
2634000	2636000	Accuracy in light
2636000	2638000	A value of 10 to 20
2640000	2642000	At the same time, of course
2642000	2644000	In Gila
2644000	2646000	They also have another one
2646000	2648000	Uh, the approach on the experiment
2648000	2650000	For example, it is
2650000	2652000	James Thompson, his super radian laser
2652000	2654000	The principle is
2654000	2656000	Uh
2656000	2658000	Generally, we
2658000	2660000	In the experiment of the night army, he
2660000	2662000	Atoms are his
2662000	2664000	His
2664000	2666000	A substance of detection, of course, is
2666000	2668000	To find a way
2668000	2670000	He also has to go through a local
2670000	2672000	For example, he wants to do a very good laser
2672000	2674000	And then through this laser
2674000	2676000	His
2676000	2678000	Made of atoms
2678000	2680000	So the atom as a whole
2680000	2682000	In his experiment, this is a
2682000	2684000	Uh
2684000	2686000	He needs a very good clock laser
2686000	2688000	And then to probe his
2688000	2690000	Uh
2690000	2692000	What is it called
2692000	2694000	Atoms are his
2694000	2696000	Absorber
2696000	2698000	Just
2698000	2700000	Atoms are his
2700000	2702000	A substance of observation
2702000	2704000	So the overall
2704000	2706000	Your light is a so-called passive
2706000	2708000	Clock because you are
2708000	2710000	You have to use a very good
2710000	2712000	Laser to observe your
2712000	2714000	Sample
2714000	2716000	James Thompson's approach is basically different
2716000	2718000	He just wants to let the atoms
2718000	2720000	Go by yourself
2720000	2722000	Release the light of this clock transition
2722000	2724000	His experiment is
2724000	2726000	Put the atom
2726000	2728000	Put it in a cavity
2728000	2730000	Then let him
2730000	2732000	A super radian effect
2732000	2734000	That's the last
2734000	2736000	The light you come out of
2736000	2738000	In principle
2738000	2740000	Uh
2740000	2742000	It's determined by the atom
2742000	2744000	Not by you
2744000	2746000	Cavity conditions
2746000	2748000	To decide
2750000	2752000	So the experiment
2752000	2754000	He is now
2754000	2756000	Make a
2756000	2758000	Super radian laser
2758000	2760000	That
2760000	2762000	Because this super radian laser
2762000	2764000	He is basically
2764000	2766000	Clock state
2766000	2768000	3P0
2768000	2770000	His
2770000	2772000	Uh
2772000	2774000	Minihertz
2774000	2776000	They are now
2776000	2778000	Super radian laser
2778000	2780000	That
2780000	2782000	They are the same
2782000	2784000	Two experiments
2784000	2786000	To make a
2786000	2788000	To measure
2788000	2790000	Super radian laser
2790000	2792000	How accurate it is
2792000	2794000	So
2794000	2796000	James Thompson put his
2796000	2798000	Super radian laser
2798000	2800000	Optical lattice clock
2800000	2802000	To make a
2802000	2804000	Beat note
2804000	2806000	To measure
2806000	2808000	Uh
2808000	2810000	His super radian laser
2810000	2812000	Conditions
2812000	2814000	Of course they are now
2814000	2816000	About 10 to 15
2816000	2818000	That
2818000	2820000	James Thompson
2820000	2822000	He also wants to do
2822000	2824000	Super radian laser
2824000	2826000	That
2826000	2828000	Super radian laser
2828000	2830000	On this number
2830000	2832000	Push down three
2832000	2834000	That means
2834000	2836000	Usually in this kind of light
2836000	2838000	Uh light experiment
2838000	2840000	You have to measure his
2840000	2842000	Uh you do the points
2842000	2844000	That is to say
2844000	2846000	You measure light
2846000	2848000	You
2848000	2850000	Uh
2850000	2852000	In principle, the accuracy
2852000	2854000	The longer you measure
2854000	2856000	Uh
2856000	2858000	The higher the accuracy is
2858000	2860000	In the light
2860000	2862000	In the experiment
2862000	2864000	If you do it in a row
2864000	2866000	You
2866000	2868000	In this super radian laser
2868000	2870000	You are one second
2870000	2872000	In principle, you can reach 10 to 18
2872000	2874000	One of the four
2874000	2876000	Conditions
2876000	2878000	That means
2878000	2880000	James Thompson gave himself a metaphor
2880000	2882000	For example, you put this light
2882000	2884000	His super radian laser
2884000	2886000	You are
2886000	2888000	Uh
2888000	2890000	In principle
2890000	2892000	Assuming that the conditions of CW
2892000	2894000	You can reach this level
2894000	2896000	That is
2896000	2898000	Of course another
2898000	2900000	Uh
2900000	2902000	The application of double-sided tape is of course
2902000	2904000	Used on atomic interference
2904000	2906000	Then we all know that atomic interference
2906000	2908000	Uh
2908000	2910000	It can be used to measure your acceleration
2910000	2912000	It can be used to measure the gravitational field
2912000	2914000	It can be used to measure
2914000	2916000	Uh
2916000	2918000	Your rotation
2918000	2920000	In principle, it has a very high accuracy
2920000	2922000	That
2922000	2924000	In the experiment, of course
2924000	2926000	His
2926000	2928000	Sensitivity
2928000	2930000	With
2930000	2932000	You in your
2932000	2934000	For example
2934000	2936000	You can
2936000	2938000	On the basis of the atomic group
2938000	2940000	You let him do
2940000	2942000	The longer the time
2942000	2944000	Or your
2944000	2946000	Your two atomic groups
2946000	2948000	Just
2948000	2950000	The greater the distance
2950000	2952000	Your sensitivity will be higher
2952000	2954000	So
2954000	2956000	Now on the experiment, of course
2956000	2958000	They take this thing
2958000	2960000	Want to do
2960000	2962000	For example
2962000	2964000	Or
2964000	2966000	Gravity wave detector
2966000	2968000	First of all, I must say
2968000	2970000	This is the atomic interference
2970000	2972000	One of them
2972000	2974000	Quite interesting application
2974000	2976000	But I don't do this myself
2976000	2978000	I can only say
2978000	2980000	On the basis of technology
2980000	2982000	Tell you a little bit
2982000	2984000	Now there are principles
2984000	2986000	In this regard
2986000	2988000	There are other teams doing
2988000	2990000	For example
2990000	2992000	On the gravity wave
2992000	2994000	On the detector
2994000	2996000	Atomic interference
2996000	2998000	In principle, he has a way to make up
2998000	3000000	Other gravity wave
3000000	3002000	Detector
3002000	3004000	For example, now
3004000	3006000	There is a LIGO on the experiment
3006000	3008000	His detection wavelength is here
3008000	3010000	That next
3010000	3012000	Proposed
3012000	3014000	Lisa to sit in space
3014000	3016000	In principle, his detection wavelength is here
3016000	3018000	There is actually a gap in the middle
3018000	3020000	This gap can be in principle
3020000	3022000	Atomic interference to make up
3022000	3024000	His advantage is
3024000	3026000	We all know gravity wave
3026000	3028000	He's going to measure this
3028000	3030000	Chirping
3030000	3032000	When two
3032000	3034000	He finally
3034000	3036000	For example, your gravity wave
3036000	3038000	Source, he finally
3038000	3040000	In the process
3040000	3042000	Your measured gravity wave
3042000	3044000	In principle, the frequency will be higher and higher
3044000	3046000	But
3046000	3048000	You experiment
3048000	3050000	At this frequency
3050000	3052000	If you have a detector
3052000	3054000	His advantage is
3054000	3056000	You can
3056000	3058000	You are in a gravity wave
3058000	3060000	Before the event
3060000	3062000	You can go through
3062000	3064000	For example, our atomic interference
3064000	3066000	After measuring the signal
3066000	3068000	He can go first
3068000	3070000	Position in space
3070000	3072000	Let you know
3072000	3074000	For example, your LIGO
3074000	3076000	You can expect
3076000	3078000	There will be a gravity wave
3078000	3080000	You can measure
3080000	3082000	Of course
3082000	3084000	Through this atomic interference
3084000	3086000	Because he's in
3086000	3088000	The frequency he corresponds to
3088000	3090000	He
3090000	3092000	Measured gravity wave
3092000	3094000	The lifetime of the event will be longer
3094000	3096000	For example, he is
3096000	3098000	0.01 hertz
3098000	3100000	To 10 hertz
3100000	3102000	So you basically
3102000	3104000	You can
3104000	3106000	He corresponds to
3106000	3108000	For example, you measure
3108000	3110000	The event
3110000	3112000	It takes a few months
3112000	3114000	He means
3114000	3116000	In the measurement process
3116000	3118000	In space
3118000	3120000	The source of your gravity wave
3120000	3122000	That
3122000	3124000	Of course you can
3124000	3126000	With other
3126000	3128000	For example, LIGO
3128000	3130000	Then
3130000	3132000	It's on some satellites
3132000	3134000	It seems to be measuring
3134000	3136000	Electromagnetic wave
3136000	3138000	Of
3138000	3140000	The principle
3140000	3142000	It means
3142000	3144000	You go to measure this gravity wave
3144000	3146000	Of
3146000	3148000	You can match other
3148000	3150000	Detector
3150000	3152000	So reach the so-called multi-messenger
3152000	3154000	One
3154000	3156000	Measurement
3156000	3158000	Of course you have to be able to do multi-messenger
3158000	3160000	It means
3160000	3162000	You have to know where he is
3162000	3164000	Those detectors on the satellite
3164000	3166000	For
3166000	3168000	Measure in that direction
3168000	3170000	So
3170000	3172000	Atomic interference
3172000	3174000	Can provide information
3174000	3176000	Of
3176000	3178000	Of course
3178000	3180000	At Stanford
3180000	3182000	Do some
3182000	3184000	Of
3184000	3186000	They first built a 10-meter
3186000	3188000	Atomic interference
3188000	3190000	That
3190000	3192000	Of course they also reached the so-called
3192000	3194000	Of
3194000	3196000	Of
3196000	3198000	The material wave
3198000	3200000	Of
3200000	3202000	Can reach 54 cm
3202000	3204000	That
3204000	3206000	That means
3206000	3208000	They also achieved some
3208000	3210000	On both sides
3210000	3212000	Some early experiments in the gravity field
3212000	3214000	For example, in this experiment
3214000	3216000	Their
3216000	3218000	In principle, your atomic group
3218000	3220000	Is
3220000	3222000	He went to throw different heights
3222000	3224000	That he experimented
3224000	3226000	In principle, here is a
3226000	3228000	For example, an 80-kilogram
3228000	3230000	Piece
3230000	3232000	Then
3232000	3234000	They went to measure this
3234000	3236000	Throw the atomic group at different heights
3236000	3238000	To scan this
3238000	3240000	In principle
3240000	3242000	Gravity field
3242000	3244000	This result
3244000	3246000	In principle, it is a
3246000	3248000	Demonstration that your
3248000	3250000	In principle, you can measure
3250000	3252000	A change in the gravity field
3252000	3254000	Of course
3254000	3256000	Of
3256000	3258000	Their next experiment
3258000	3260000	Of course, I want to scale up
3260000	3262000	I want to do, for example, 100 meters
3262000	3264000	Then
3264000	3266000	They want to do it with a private atom
3266000	3268000	Because private atoms
3268000	3270000	Some
3270000	3272000	In the past
3272000	3274000	For example, he first had a
3274000	3276000	That he experimented
3276000	3278000	He can reach
3278000	3280000	Higher accuracy
3280000	3282000	So
3282000	3284000	This is a private atom
3284000	3286000	In the next few years
3286000	3288000	On gravity
3288000	3290000	Detector
3290000	3292000	A
3292000	3294000	Competitive application
3294000	3296000	That
3296000	3298000	Then we experimented
3298000	3300000	Then we do
3300000	3302000	Our ultimate goal is to do
3302000	3304000	Then
3304000	3306000	We have a way to produce
3306000	3308000	The so-called
3308000	3310000	Continuous
3310000	3312000	Assuming we have a way to produce
3312000	3314000	Continuous Boson-Einstein connection
3314000	3316000	Continuous
3316000	3318000	In fact, on the experiment
3318000	3320000	We also have
3320000	3322000	Continuous
3322000	3324000	So this is
3324000	3326000	Mainly in our
3326000	3328000	Want to do
3328000	3330000	Several plans
3330000	3332000	That
3332000	3334000	I think I might be a little too slow
3334000	3336000	A little
3336000	3338000	Speed up
3356000	3358000	Then we experimented
3358000	3360000	Just mentioned
3360000	3362000	To achieve continuous
3362000	3364000	Laser cooling
3364000	3366000	That just said
3366000	3368000	Laser cooling and evaporation cooling
3368000	3370000	On the experiment
3370000	3372000	Not compatible
3372000	3374000	The reason is because
3374000	3376000	Laser cooling has a laser cooling temperature limit
3376000	3378000	That next stage
3378000	3380000	You just want to put the atomic group
3380000	3382000	To
3382000	3384000	To the
3384000	3386000	Put the atomic group to
3386000	3388000	For example, we use the
3388000	3390000	Inside and then inside
3390000	3392000	Evaporation cooling
3392000	3394000	At the same time you want to
3394000	3396000	Turn off the laser cooling light
3396000	3398000	The reason is because the laser cooling is used
3398000	3400000	Originally
3400000	3402000	Resonant light
3402000	3404000	At the same time
3404000	3406000	In the cooling process
3406000	3408000	Resonant
3408000	3410000	That is to say
3410000	3412000	Resonant light
3412000	3414000	If there is a way
3414000	3416000	If there is a way to stimulate the atomic light
3416000	3418000	That
3418000	3420000	Your atomic principle
3420000	3422000	Is constantly heated
3422000	3424000	So in the evaporation cooling process
3424000	3426000	We must turn off the laser cooling light
3426000	3428000	That
3428000	3430000	Of course
3430000	3432000	That is
3432000	3434000	You can't do it on the experiment
3434000	3436000	To achieve a so-called continuous
3436000	3438000	A
3438000	3440000	Because these two cooling steps are incompatible
3440000	3442000	But
3442000	3444000	In 2013, our lab
3444000	3446000	The principle is
3446000	3448000	Did an experiment
3448000	3450000	That
3450000	3452000	There is a way to achieve
3452000	3454000	That is to say we are completely
3454000	3456000	No evaporation cooling
3456000	3458000	We only rely on laser cooling
3458000	3460000	To achieve Boson-enzyme condensation
3460000	3462000	That
3462000	3464000	Of course
3464000	3466000	Here is the introduction
3466000	3468000	We put it on the experiment
3468000	3470000	That is the so-called transparency beam
3470000	3472000	I just talked about the laser cooling
3472000	3474000	The source of the cooling limit
3474000	3476000	Because
3476000	3478000	When the density is higher
3478000	3480000	Your laser cooling light
3480000	3482000	In the process of re-release
3482000	3484000	It will heat up your atom
3484000	3486000	That
3486000	3488000	In the experiment, we go through this
3488000	3490000	We call it transparency beam
3490000	3492000	We find a way to let the atom
3492000	3494000	To my laser cooling light
3494000	3496000	In principle
3496000	3498000	Become transparent
3498000	3500000	That is to say, my atom can't see my laser cooling light
3500000	3502000	That
3502000	3504000	Through this
3504000	3506000	Transparency beam
3506000	3508000	A little trick
3508000	3510000	Then we have a way to achieve
3510000	3512000	Only by laser cooling
3512000	3514000	To achieve Boson-enzyme condensation
3514000	3516000	That
3516000	3518000	Its mechanism is actually quite simple
3518000	3520000	That I am now
3520000	3522000	In principle
3522000	3524000	In the film
3524000	3526000	In my light well
3526000	3528000	That
3528000	3530000	At the same time
3530000	3532000	I have my laser cooling light
3532000	3534000	Is in this
3534000	3536000	Um, use this
3536000	3538000	Laser cooling light
3538000	3540000	That its laser cooling
3540000	3542000	The cooling limit is in principle
3542000	3544000	Corresponding to
3544000	3546000	Doppler temperature
3546000	3548000	In principle
3548000	3550000	Doppler cooling temperature is about
3550000	3552000	180 nK
3552000	3554000	Doppler temperature is about
3554000	3556000	About 500 nK
3556000	3558000	So
3558000	3560000	Its laser cooling light corresponds to
3560000	3562000	The temperature limit is actually very low
3562000	3564000	So
3564000	3566000	My group of atoms in principle
3566000	3568000	In the light well
3568000	3570000	Through laser cooling
3570000	3572000	Can reach
3572000	3574000	Almost
3574000	3576000	1 uC
3576000	3578000	That
3578000	3580000	That's why
3580000	3582000	To reach such a low temperature
3582000	3584000	Mainly just mentioned
3584000	3586000	Those
3586000	3588000	Um
3588000	3590000	Your
3590000	3592000	Atoms will still have this
3592000	3594000	Reabsorption of light
3594000	3596000	Being heated
3596000	3598000	The state
3598000	3600000	Of course, we use this
3600000	3602000	Transparency beam
3602000	3604000	Let me
3604000	3606000	Excited state
3606000	3608000	This light is in principle
3608000	3610000	Address my
3610000	3612000	Excited state to another state
3612000	3614000	That
3614000	3616000	The reason for this light
3616000	3618000	Because of this light
3618000	3620000	My excited state
3620000	3622000	Its state is
3622000	3624000	So-called
3624000	3626000	AC star shift
3630000	3632000	That
3632000	3634000	Because of this light
3634000	3636000	My atom is in this
3636000	3638000	Position
3638000	3640000	It
3640000	3642000	Uh
3642000	3644000	Excited state
3644000	3646000	Light shift
3646000	3648000	So
3648000	3650000	It can't
3650000	3652000	In principle
3652000	3654000	My light will not
3654000	3656000	Interact with this atom
3656000	3658000	My light will not
3658000	3660000	Interact with the group of atoms in this position
3660000	3662000	That
3662000	3664000	Of course we are
3664000	3666000	My
3666000	3668000	The group of atoms is in my dipole trap
3668000	3670000	Then
3670000	3672000	Right
3672000	3674000	What you see is the distribution of the group of atoms in principle
3674000	3676000	Let's say I open my
3676000	3678000	Transparency beam
3678000	3680000	I'm also doing
3680000	3682000	Uh
3682000	3684000	Imaging
3684000	3686000	Because
3686000	3688000	Sorry
3688000	3690000	Let me say it again
3690000	3692000	This
3692000	3694000	Absorption imaging
3694000	3696000	Transition
3696000	3698000	You can see the overall distribution of the group of atoms in principle
3698000	3700000	There is one in the middle
3700000	3702000	In principle, the density is higher
3702000	3704000	Because I have this
3704000	3706000	Dimple relationship
3706000	3708000	Now I open my transparency beam
3708000	3710000	Because
3710000	3712000	In this position
3712000	3714000	It
3714000	3716000	Excited state
3716000	3718000	Light shift
3718000	3720000	That is to say
3720000	3722000	Shift
3722000	3724000	So my
3724000	3726000	This beam of light
3726000	3728000	In principle, in this position
3728000	3730000	There is no way to interact with the atom
3730000	3732000	So you are doing the same
3732000	3734000	When imaging
3734000	3736000	Use this beam of light
3736000	3738000	The group of atoms is in this position
3738000	3740000	It
3740000	3742000	It's with this
3742000	3744000	This beam of light is in principle
3744000	3746000	It's not fair
3746000	3748000	So it's in principle
3748000	3750000	In principle, there is no way to interact with those atoms
3750000	3752000	So you are in
3752000	3754000	You can't see it in the image
3754000	3756000	That
3756000	3758000	Of course, the experiment
3758000	3760000	Through this
3760000	3762000	You can imagine
3762000	3764000	My laser cooling light
3764000	3766000	In
3766000	3768000	Reservoir
3768000	3770000	It continues to cool my laser
3770000	3772000	That
3772000	3774000	In
3774000	3776000	Dimple
3776000	3778000	Because of my
3778000	3780000	Transparency beam
3780000	3782000	Protect my atom
3782000	3784000	So in principle, the atom
3784000	3786000	Will not be these
3786000	3788000	Light
3788000	3790000	Do not interact with these lights
3790000	3792000	That experiment
3792000	3794000	Laser light is constantly
3794000	3796000	In
3796000	3798000	Reservoir
3798000	3800000	Then
3800000	3802000	At the same time
3802000	3804000	In my dimple
3804000	3806000	If you don't interact with these lights
3806000	3808000	That my
3808000	3810000	In dimple
3810000	3812000	The density is high enough
3812000	3814000	The temperature is low enough
3814000	3816000	He has a way to form Boson
3816000	3818000	That's why the experiment
3818000	3820000	On the right side of the picture
3820000	3822000	In principle
3822000	3824000	We hit it in the experiment
3824000	3826000	Through
3826000	3828000	Laser cooling
3828000	3830000	To achieve Boson
3830000	3832000	That whole process
3832000	3834000	We did not do an evaporation
3834000	3836000	Cooling
3836000	3838000	That
3838000	3840000	This experiment
3840000	3842000	When this experiment is completed
3842000	3844000	Of course we want to go further
3844000	3846000	The so-called continuous
3846000	3848000	Atomic laser
3848000	3850000	Because now
3850000	3852000	To achieve Boson
3852000	3854000	We are completely free
3854000	3856000	We completely skipped the evaporation
3856000	3858000	Cooling
3858000	3860000	That experiment
3860000	3862000	To achieve the so-called continuous
3862000	3864000	Atomic laser
3864000	3866000	That
3868000	3870000	Of course
3870000	3872000	Just introduced
3872000	3874000	That is to say
3874000	3876000	On the experiment
3876000	3878000	My laser cooling evaporates
3890000	3892000	That experiment
3892000	3894000	Of course
3894000	3896000	I am evaporating
3896000	3898000	In the process of laser cooling
3898000	3900000	I just ignored
3900000	3902000	That is to say
3902000	3904000	We do laser cooling on the experiment
3904000	3906000	There are two laser cooling stages
3906000	3908000	First of all
3908000	3910000	In principle, there is the first one
3910000	3912000	The so-called blue mark
3912000	3914000	That is to say, use this laser cooling light
3914000	3916000	To do the first stage of cooling
3916000	3918000	Then
3918000	3920000	Use this
3920000	3922000	Thinner light
3922000	3924000	To reach a lower temperature
3924000	3926000	That
3926000	3928000	Then
3928000	3930000	This Transparency Beam
3930000	3932000	In principle, it can protect my atom
3932000	3934000	Let it
3934000	3936000	Not interact with this laser light
3936000	3938000	But on the experiment
3938000	3940000	We still need
3940000	3942000	The first stage of laser cooling
3942000	3944000	To accumulate my atomic number
3944000	3946000	To reach a lower temperature
3946000	3948000	To accumulate my atomic number
3948000	3950000	To reach enough atoms
3950000	3952000	To do the second stage of cooling
3952000	3954000	That is to say
3954000	3956000	There is a two-stage laser cooling
3956000	3958000	Step
3958000	3960000	And my
3960000	3962000	Transparency Beam
3962000	3964000	Only in the second stage
3964000	3966000	It works in the laser cooling process
3966000	3968000	But on the experiment
3968000	3970000	We still need the first stage
3970000	3972000	Laser cooling light
3972000	3974000	So
3974000	3976000	Next
3976000	3978000	We are going to do
3978000	3980000	Continuous
3980000	3982000	Uh
3982000	3984000	Polaris
3984000	3986000	Or continuous atomic laser
3986000	3988000	The second stage
3988000	3990000	Uh
3990000	3992000	Light we can pass
3992000	3994000	This Transparency Beam to protect my atom
3994000	3996000	But
3996000	3998000	The first stage of laser cooling light
3998000	4000000	We experiment
4000000	4002000	In principle, it is
4002000	4004000	Let
4004000	4006000	Uh
4006000	4008000	In another space
4008000	4010000	Go to
4010000	4012000	Finish my first stage of laser cooling
4012000	4014000	Then the atom
4014000	4016000	In principle
4016000	4018000	To the second space
4018000	4020000	To achieve my so-called continuous
4020000	4022000	Polaris
4022000	4024000	Of course
4024000	4026000	This is our experiment
4026000	4028000	Is
4028000	4030000	After the atom came out of the oven
4030000	4032000	The first stage
4032000	4034000	Uh
4034000	4036000	What we use is what we just said
4036000	4038000	Uh
4038000	4040000	Uh
4040000	4042000	Do the first stage of laser cooling
4042000	4044000	Next
4044000	4046000	Then
4046000	4048000	In this chamber above
4048000	4050000	This 30
4050000	4052000	Megahertz
4052000	4054000	To do
4054000	4056000	Uh
4056000	4058000	Uh
4058000	4060000	After the atom came out of the oven
4060000	4062000	My atomic number is essentially
4062000	4064000	To
4064000	4066000	The following chamber
4066000	4068000	Go
4068000	4070000	To achieve my
4070000	4072000	Continuous Polaris
4072000	4074000	That space
4074000	4076000	In this area
4076000	4078000	In principle, it is completely
4078000	4080000	Uh
4080000	4082000	With my first stage of laser cooling
4082000	4084000	The space is separated
4084000	4086000	That experiment
4086000	4088000	In the middle of the chamber
4088000	4090000	Of course there is also this
4090000	4092000	Uh
4092000	4094000	In principle, it is to avoid some
4094000	4096000	Scattering light
4096000	4098000	Scattered blue photon
4098000	4100000	Go to the following chamber
4100000	4102000	That
4102000	4104000	First of all
4104000	4106000	This is our general chamber design
4106000	4108000	That
4108000	4110000	We are
4110000	4112000	Just do
4112000	4114000	All the first stage of laser cooling
4114000	4116000	Achieve
4116000	4118000	The atomic number is running
4118000	4120000	To the following chamber
4120000	4122000	That
4122000	4124000	In the following chamber, we are essentially
4124000	4126000	No blue light at all
4126000	4128000	We use the so-called
4128000	4130000	Uh
4130000	4132000	To reach a lower temperature
4132000	4134000	Of course
4134000	4136000	We want to have
4136000	4138000	Uh
4138000	4140000	We first achieve
4140000	4142000	First make a
4142000	4144000	After that
4144000	4146000	The atomic number is essentially
4146000	4148000	In because this
4148000	4150000	Is a 2D
4150000	4152000	So it's on the axis
4152000	4154000	In principle, the atomic number can be
4154000	4156000	Run up and run down
4156000	4158000	The atomic number running down
4158000	4160000	We are
4160000	4162000	In principle
4162000	4164000	Through a molasses
4164000	4166000	To cool
4166000	4168000	Let the overall atomic number
4168000	4170000	Uh
4170000	4172000	Increase
4172000	4174000	That
4174000	4176000	At the same time we are
4176000	4178000	It's a bit like
4178000	4180000	Put two blue push pins
4180000	4182000	To
4182000	4184000	Avoid the atomic number
4184000	4186000	Run up
4186000	4188000	You are
4188000	4190000	In
4190000	4192000	The following chamber
4192000	4194000	Atomic number
4194000	4196000	Relatively higher
4196000	4198000	That
4198000	4200000	Uh
4200000	4202000	As I just said
4202000	4204000	But we have to achieve a series of
4204000	4206000	4BEC and
4206000	4208000	In the atomic laser chamber
4208000	4210000	We don't need blue light at all
4210000	4212000	That
4212000	4214000	The red light used is essentially
4214000	4216000	Corresponding to
4216000	4218000	Uh
4218000	4220000	On the surface
4220000	4222000	Because it is
4222000	4224000	Only 7.4 kHz
4224000	4226000	The bandwidth
4226000	4228000	Corresponding to
4228000	4230000	In principle, only
4230000	4232000	About
4232000	4234000	10
4234000	4236000	15
4236000	4238000	Gravity acceleration
4238000	4240000	So it's actually a very
4240000	4242000	Inefficient
4242000	4244000	Speed reduction
4244000	4246000	Of course we are
4246000	4248000	In principle
4248000	4250000	Put this
4250000	4252000	7.4 kHz
4252000	4254000	The bandwidth we want to do
4254000	4256000	Frequency broadening
4256000	4258000	To make it overall
4258000	4260000	Acceleration
4260000	4262000	That is to say
4262000	4264000	To have a way
4264000	4266000	Uh
4266000	4268000	For example, I'm from the top
4268000	4270000	Chamber
4270000	4272000	The atomic number it corresponds to is a
4272000	4274000	6 mps
4274000	4276000	A
4276000	4278000	Speed limit
4278000	4280000	That
4280000	4282000	Of course we have reached
4282000	4284000	Uh
4284000	4286000	At least the first stage
4286000	4288000	In practice, we can't reach
4288000	4290000	Steady state red mod
4290000	4292000	That steady state red mod is essentially
4292000	4294000	The first one in practice
4294000	4296000	Through
4296000	4298000	Continuous
4298000	4300000	Use
4300000	4302000	7
4302000	4304000	7.4 kHz bandwidth
4304000	4306000	To achieve
4306000	4308000	A mod condition
4308000	4310000	That it
4310000	4312000	In principle
4312000	4314000	We have just reached
4314000	4316000	Uh
4316000	4318000	First
4318000	4320000	I just started talking about it
4320000	4322000	We have a way
4322000	4324000	In space
4324000	4326000	In different spaces with different
4326000	4328000	Laser cooling
4328000	4330000	In this framework
4330000	4332000	In principle, it is realized
4332000	4334000	Blue laser cooling on the top chamber
4334000	4336000	Red laser cooling on the bottom chamber
4336000	4338000	A condition
4338000	4340000	That
4340000	4342000	Of course
4342000	4344000	In practice
4344000	4346000	We put
4346000	4348000	Mod center
4348000	4350000	Pull
4350000	4352000	Uh
4352000	4354000	Side by side
4354000	4356000	The main reason is because
4356000	4358000	If you make a mod here
4358000	4360000	He will still see
4360000	4362000	Blue scatter light
4362000	4364000	So
4364000	4366000	Through
4366000	4368000	My
4368000	4370000	Mod center moved to the side
4370000	4372000	After
4372000	4374000	Can reach a lower temperature
4374000	4376000	On the experiment
4376000	4378000	At the same time, of course
4378000	4380000	I'm here
4384000	4386000	On this condition here, I reached one
4386000	4388000	On the experiment
4390000	4392000	Continuous
4392000	4394000	One
4394000	4396000	Atomic sample
4398000	4400000	On the experiment, I tried to
4400000	4402000	Produce a pulse-like
4402000	4404000	Scatter light connection
4404000	4406000	Then use this
4406000	4408000	Scatter light connection
4408000	4410000	To measure
4410000	4412000	My lifetime
4412000	4414000	The point is
4414000	4416000	I have a BEC here
4418000	4420000	Then I use this BEC
4420000	4422000	Then at the same time I turn on my blue laser cooling light
4422000	4424000	I'm going to measure my BEC lifetime
4424000	4426000	Then through this step
4426000	4428000	I'm going to make sure
4428000	4430000	In this experiment
4430000	4432000	I'm here
4432000	4434000	He won't be
4434000	4436000	This place
4436000	4438000	Laser cooling light
4438000	4440000	That
4440000	4442000	We're going to measure his lifetime
4442000	4444000	Almost unchanged
4444000	4446000	So
4446000	4448000	So in this experiment
4448000	4450000	We're sure
4450000	4452000	My experiment
4452000	4454000	My
4454000	4456000	The origin of this place
4456000	4458000	Will not be above me
4458000	4460000	Blue laser
4460000	4462000	Cooling photon
4462000	4464000	Then we try to
4464000	4466000	Characterize my
4466000	4468000	A condition
4468000	4470000	Then we found out that
4470000	4472000	The mass produced here
4472000	4474000	Its space density
4474000	4476000	With all the previous
4476000	4478000	Experiment to compare
4478000	4480000	We have a principle
4480000	4482000	100 times
4482000	4484000	That is, we compare
4484000	4486000	All the previous
4486000	4488000	Steady state
4488000	4490000	Compared to the conditions
4490000	4492000	Our mass
4492000	4494000	At least 100 times
4494000	4496000	The increase in the number of space density
4496000	4498000	This is our principle
4498000	4500000	The first piece of paper
4500000	4502000	Junjia
4502000	4504000	Hello
4504000	4506000	I'm sorry because it's a little over time
4506000	4508000	You probably still
4508000	4510000	How long are you going to talk about
4510000	4512000	Because we usually talk about an hour
4512000	4514000	Yeah
4514000	4516000	Take a look
4516000	4518000	So if you feel
4518000	4520000	I think everyone is by the way
4520000	4522000	There's something wrong with you
4522000	4524000	To a stage
4524000	4526000	If you think it's a paragraph
4526000	4528000	That's it for today
4528000	4530000	Let everyone come
4530000	4532000	Please ask questions about your content
4532000	4534000	Like this
4534000	4536000	Okay
4538000	4540000	I'll talk about it for another ten minutes
4540000	4542000	In principle
4542000	4544000	Because in the first experiment
4544000	4546000	We reach the principle
4546000	4548000	100 times
4548000	4550000	The increase in the number of space density
4550000	4552000	But
4552000	4554000	We still can't do it in time
4554000	4556000	The wave is very condensed
4556000	4558000	Then we have the second experiment
4558000	4560000	In principle
4560000	4562000	Is
4564000	4566000	In principle
4566000	4568000	In principle
4568000	4570000	In principle, we have a red mark here
4570000	4572000	Then we
4572000	4574000	Put the red mark
4574000	4576000	Continuously exposed to our DiploTrap
4576000	4578000	Inside
4578000	4580000	My principle
4580000	4582000	Is that you can run through
4582000	4584000	On the right
4584000	4586000	A DiploTrap
4586000	4588000	One condition
4588000	4590000	Then
4590000	4592000	He also continues to use
4592000	4594000	After these tricks
4594000	4596000	We have a way
4596000	4598000	A continuous
4598000	4600000	A loading
4600000	4602000	Then finally
4602000	4604000	In this place
4604000	4606000	This is my
4606000	4608000	I want to produce my one here
4608000	4610000	SteadyStateBEC
4610000	4612000	In SteadyStateBEC
4612000	4614000	In principle
4614000	4616000	We have to use this isotope
4616000	4618000	To realize
4618000	4620000	In principle
4620000	4622000	To reach
4622000	4624000	In principle
4624000	4626000	We have now reached
4626000	4628000	The condition
4628000	4630000	That is far from our goal
4630000	4632000	In principle
4632000	4634000	We are now in the same number
4634000	4636000	So
4636000	4638000	Of course we are now
4638000	4640000	The next step is to hope
4642000	4644000	Of course
4644000	4646000	We now have a new way to cool
4646000	4648000	Because
4648000	4650000	In terms of here
4650000	4652000	I have a Zeeman SlowerBeam here
4652000	4654000	Is our one deceleration mechanism
4654000	4656000	Then we found that this deceleration mechanism
4656000	4658000	In principle
4658000	4660000	It will heat up again in the experiment
4660000	4662000	The source here
4662000	4664000	So
4664000	4666000	We have
4666000	4668000	Develop a new deceleration method
4668000	4670000	In the new experiment
4670000	4672000	In principle, we are going to use this new deceleration method
4672000	4674000	I hope I can go further
4674000	4676000	Try to put this
4676000	4678000	The density of the phase space
4678000	4680000	Increase
4680000	4682000	In the end, of course, I hope I can reach
4682000	4684000	Continuous BC
4684000	4686000	So
4686000	4688000	I think I may have talked too long
4688000	4690000	In principle, this is our current state
4690000	4692000	In principle, this is our current state
4692000	4694000	So
4708000	4710000	To do a brief summary
4710000	4712000	In principle
4712000	4714000	In our new experiment
4714000	4716000	We hope to reach
4716000	4718000	In space
4718000	4720000	Separate these two different cooling
4720000	4722000	Laser cooling
4722000	4724000	Step
4724000	4726000	In the experiment
4726000	4728000	We have a new experiment
4728000	4730000	We built a new experiment
4730000	4732000	That reached the first stage
4732000	4734000	High Phase Space Density
4734000	4736000	A condition
4736000	4738000	And then try to realize
4738000	4740000	Continuous
4740000	4742000	In principle
4742000	4744000	DipoleTrapLoading
4744000	4746000	And finally reach a
4746000	4748000	Space density
4748000	4750000	A state
4750000	4752000	I just talked about
4752000	4754000	In this part
4754000	4756000	Deceleration mechanism
4756000	4758000	We found
4758000	4760000	There is a heating effect on our atomic group
4760000	4762000	So we
4762000	4764000	Try to develop new
4764000	4766000	That is to say different
4766000	4768000	Deceleration mechanism
4768000	4770000	In the new experiment
4770000	4772000	Hope to try to break through this
4772000	4774000	The density of the phase space is now
4774000	4776000	A bottleneck
4776000	4778000	Once
4778000	4780000	In principle, we have a way
4780000	4782000	Achieve continuous
4782000	4784000	Deceleration
4784000	4786000	That's about it
4792000	4794000	Hello
4800000	4802000	Power
4806000	4808000	Power
4826000	4828000	Hello
4830000	4832000	Did you hear
4836000	4838000	Hello
4848000	4850000	Hello
4854000	4856000	Ok
4856000	4858000	Thank you for the speech
4858000	4860000	That
4860000	4862000	Now
4862000	4864000	Is there anything about the speech?
4864000	4866000	No problem
4866000	4868000	Welcome to open questions
4882000	4884000	How many people are there now?
4888000	4890000	Just
4890000	4892000	There are about nine in the peak period
4894000	4896000	I think
4896000	4898000	It's a bit too hard
4898000	4900000	to talk about it later
4900000	4902000	Then
4902000	4904000	I think
4904000	4906000	Everyone wants to hear
4906000	4908000	There are some applications
4908000	4910000	in the middle
4910000	4912000	Like you said, like gravity
4912000	4914000	That
4914000	4916000	Or other things
4916000	4918000	What are the conditions
4918000	4920000	that need to be met
4920000	4922000	You say you are close to them
4922000	4924000	Almost the same number
4924000	4926000	How long do you expect
4926000	4928000	Will be completed
4928000	4930000	Or within two or three years
4930000	4932000	Is it like this?
4934000	4936000	In principle, our experiment now
4936000	4938000	Of course it is
4938000	4940000	Put
4940000	4942000	New
4942000	4944000	Speed ​​limit
4944000	4946000	Applied to the experiment
4946000	4948000	That
4948000	4950000	In principle, I will do it again
4950000	4952000	Then this time
4952000	4954000	My speed limit
4954000	4956000	Instead of using
4958000	4960000	Radiation pressure force
4960000	4962000	I will use it now
4962000	4964000	My new speed limit
4964000	4966000	That
4966000	4968000	Briefly introduce
4970000	4972000	My new speed limit
4972000	4974000	In principle
4976000	4978000	Is me
4980000	4982000	In principle
4982000	4984000	Let the atom go
4984000	4986000	I am on my excited state
4986000	4988000	To produce a
4988000	4990000	Potential landscape
4990000	4992000	Then once my atom is
4992000	4994000	After being stimulated
4994000	4996000	Its energy
4996000	4998000	Is through this excited state
4998000	5000000	Potential landscape
5000000	5002000	It's climbing this
5002000	5004000	On the excited state
5004000	5006000	A process
5006000	5008000	To take the energy
5008000	5010000	So this is
5010000	5012000	In principle, it is my new speed limit
5012000	5014000	That experiment
5014000	5016000	I hope I can avoid this
5016000	5018000	Speed ​​limit
5018000	5020000	To heat up
5020000	5022000	My atomic group
5022000	5024000	But at the same time
5024000	5026000	It won't
5026000	5028000	To affect
5028000	5030000	I
5034000	5036000	Atomic group
5036000	5038000	A temperature
5038000	5040000	So the new experimental principle is
5040000	5042000	I hope to prove this as soon as possible
5042000	5044000	That is to say
5044000	5046000	My new speed limit
5046000	5048000	It won't affect me
5048000	5050000	Final
5050000	5052000	This is in
5052000	5054000	Atomic group inside
5054000	5056000	Then because it won't heat it
5056000	5058000	So hope
5058000	5060000	Also in density
5060000	5062000	Temperature conditions
5062000	5064000	Under the conditions
5064000	5066000	To achieve my continuous
5066000	5068000	Potential landscape
5068000	5070000	That
5070000	5072000	At least two more experiments
5072000	5074000	About two months
5074000	5076000	That hope
5076000	5078000	In principle
5078000	5080000	Almost tested
5080000	5082000	That
5082000	5084000	Is to be able to
5084000	5086000	Try to answer this question
5086000	5088000	Under the new speed limit
5088000	5090000	I have no way to achieve my
5090000	5092000	Continuous potential landscape
5092000	5094000	Thank you
5122000	5124000	Hey, can I ask another question?
5124000	5126000	Is a little
5128000	5130000	More
5130000	5132000	General
5132000	5134000	That is
5134000	5136000	Why did you choose
5136000	5138000	Is this strong?
5140000	5142000	And you just mentioned
5142000	5144000	Use his
5144000	5146000	Red number
5146000	5148000	That
5148000	5150000	Red number
5150000	5152000	The use of
5158000	5160000	The same number of conditions
5160000	5162000	Is
5162000	5164000	Here
5164000	5166000	There are different numbers
5166000	5168000	For example, strong
5168000	5170000	That
5170000	5172000	You have to reach bc
5172000	5174000	You
5174000	5176000	Your
5176000	5178000	He has one
5178000	5180000	At least
5180000	5182000	This
5182000	5184000	Decide
5184000	5186000	There is no way
5186000	5188000	Uh
5188000	5190000	Go
5190000	5192000	Do effective
5192000	5194000	Thermalization
5194000	5196000	Because you have to do
5196000	5198000	Your
5198000	5200000	To do a heat balance
5200000	5202000	Condition
5202000	5204000	That
5204000	5206000	Because his
5206000	5208000	Very low
5208000	5210000	So he
5210000	5212000	Can't see each other
5212000	5214000	So
5214000	5216000	Your cooling process
5216000	5218000	You don't have a so-called
5218000	5220000	Heat balance
5220000	5222000	So when you're cooling
5222000	5224000	He's hard
5224000	5226000	Uh, the first one
5226000	5228000	It's hard to go
5228000	5230000	The second one is
5230000	5232000	So low
5232000	5234000	And it's almost negative
5234000	5236000	In fact, there's no way
5236000	5238000	Uh, stable
5238000	5240000	So in practice
5240000	5242000	Even this
5242000	5244000	His
5244000	5246000	Very high
5246000	5248000	But because of this
5248000	5250000	He's not a
5250000	5252000	Easy to reach bc
5252000	5254000	The same number
5254000	5256000	So that
5256000	5258000	That's too high
5258000	5260000	So he's easy
5260000	5262000	Once he's
5262000	5264000	He's
5264000	5266000	He's too high
5266000	5268000	He
5268000	5270000	In principle, the heat balance is too fast
5270000	5272000	And then
5272000	5274000	It can even cause heating
5274000	5276000	That
5276000	5278000	He just happened to be
5278000	5280000	A very friendly
5280000	5282000	That
5282000	5284000	So in practice, we're going to
5284000	5286000	84
5286000	5288000	84
5288000	5290000	Want to achieve
5290000	5292000	That
5292000	5294000	Uh, why
5294000	5296000	The main reason is also
5296000	5298000	Mainly because
5298000	5300000	Um
5308000	5310000	He
5310000	5312000	The first stage
5312000	5314000	Laser cooling
5314000	5316000	So I can do very effective
5316000	5318000	Laser cooling to
5318000	5320000	Fast
5320000	5322000	Uh
5322000	5324000	Accumulate atoms
5324000	5326000	Because he has his second stage
5326000	5328000	Laser cooling
5328000	5330000	First
5330000	5332000	Width
5332000	5334000	It won't be too narrow
5334000	5336000	So I can still use it to do some
5336000	5338000	Uh, uh
5338000	5340000	The first one is wide enough
5340000	5342000	So I can do laser cooling to very low temperature
5342000	5344000	That
5344000	5346000	Can reach very low temperature
5346000	5348000	That
5348000	5350000	Because of that 2013
5350000	5352000	We
5352000	5354000	Laser cooling to bc
5354000	5356000	It's a mechanism of transparency
5356000	5358000	Go
5358000	5360000	To achieve the so-called full light
5360000	5362000	Laser cooling
5362000	5364000	Uh
5364000	5366000	Boomerang
5366000	5368000	Completely skipped
5368000	5370000	The step of evaporation and cooling
5370000	5372000	So that experiment
5372000	5374000	The double line becomes
5374000	5376000	The most likely
5376000	5378000	Achieve continuous
5378000	5380000	Boomerang
5380000	5382000	A element
5382000	5384000	So in principle
5384000	5386000	So we will choose private atoms
5386000	5388000	Mainly because of our experiment
5388000	5390000	Is
5390000	5392000	Start with private atoms
5392000	5394000	So
5394000	5396000	This
5398000	5400000	There is a reason to choose him
5400000	5402000	Ah
5402000	5404000	Is it
5404000	5406000	The 2A group
5406000	5408000	All can
5408000	5410000	Up and down
5410000	5412000	Everyone uses private atoms
5412000	5414000	That
5414000	5416000	Is there a heavier one?
5416000	5418000	Also
5418000	5420000	If you can't reach it
5420000	5422000	Change to a unified group
5422000	5424000	You can do it
5424000	5426000	Or maybe
5426000	5428000	There is no way
5428000	5430000	A lot of people doing AMO
5430000	5432000	Looking at the laser
5432000	5434000	Can you get used to it?
5434000	5436000	Or can you buy it?
5442000	5444000	Your question is
5444000	5446000	First in the second step
5446000	5448000	Try to answer
5450000	5452000	Laser cooling to bc
5452000	5454000	You have to find a way to make your atoms
5454000	5456000	A transparent mechanism
5456000	5458000	In this experiment
5458000	5460000	Is through a
5460000	5462000	In our transparency
5462000	5464000	To let the atom
5464000	5466000	For this light
5466000	5468000	Be transparent
5468000	5470000	But in space
5470000	5472000	We have to find a way
5472000	5474000	To put the atom
5474000	5476000	From the oven stage
5476000	5478000	Cool to have a way
5478000	5480000	Uh, there are two
5480000	5482000	The steps of laser cooling
5482000	5484000	Assuming
5484000	5486000	If you use other 2A elements
5486000	5488000	Cover the atom
5488000	5490000	His
5490000	5492000	Transition
5492000	5494000	Its bandwidth is 350Hz
5494000	5496000	That he actually
5496000	5498000	Doing this
5498000	5500000	Atom
5504000	5506000	If you use the atom
5506000	5508000	Your
5508000	5510000	Transfer
5510000	5512000	Difficult to achieve
5512000	5514000	That is to say
5514000	5516000	If you want to do this
5516000	5518000	Transfer
5518000	5520000	Difficult
5520000	5522000	7.4kHz
5522000	5524000	It corresponds to
5524000	5526000	15
5526000	5528000	15
5528000	5530000	If you use the atom
5530000	5532000	350kHz
5532000	5534000	350Hz
5534000	5536000	Almost
5536000	5538000	Not too scattered
5538000	5540000	That means you're hard
5540000	5542000	Efficient deceleration
5542000	5544000	You almost can't
5544000	5546000	For
5546000	5548000	You cover the atom again
5548000	5550000	It's hard to decelerate
5550000	5552000	That is to say
5552000	5554000	Somehow
5554000	5556000	In a sweet spot
5568000	5570000	Hello
5572000	5574000	Hello
5580000	5582000	Hello
5592000	5594000	Hey
5594000	5596000	Other questions
5602000	5604000	Hello
5604000	5606000	Hello
5606000	5608000	Other people
5608000	5610000	If you don't have any questions, you can ask now
5610000	5612000	Otherwise, our speech will end today
5632000	5634000	Hello
5634000	5636000	Hello
5636000	5638000	Hello
5638000	5640000	Please turn on the mic
5640000	5644000	Let's give a round of applause to Junjia
5648000	5650000	Okay, only me left
5650000	5652000	Sorry
5652000	5654000	Because I asked some small details
5654000	5656000	I'm afraid everyone is getting impatient
5656000	5658000	Thank you
5658000	5662000	Junjia, next time we'll discuss other questions with you
5664000	5666000	Okay
5666000	5668000	Okay, thank you
5668000	5670000	Junjia, go to sleep
5670000	5672000	It's a bit late, it's 3pm
5674000	5676000	Okay
5676000	5678000	Good night
5678000	5680000	Bye
5688000	5690000	Thank you for watching!
5690000	5692000	See you next time!
