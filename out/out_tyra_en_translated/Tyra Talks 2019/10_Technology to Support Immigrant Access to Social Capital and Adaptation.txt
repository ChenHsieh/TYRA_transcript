Oh, he said the recording is on.
I'm the host for today, Zhang Lian-Ping.
I just graduated last winter.
I graduated from UNC and did research in social psychology.
I just graduated, so I'm a no-name now.
Before we start today's talk,
I'd like to introduce Project TIRA to you.
As our website says,
our goal is to build a timely,
cross-national academic information sharing platform
to connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world
to exchange academic results and trends in various fields
in the overseas and Taiwan academic circles,
and to provide a platform for effective communication.
To put it simply,
we want to build a platform
to help Taiwan researchers from all over the world
communicate with each other.
We hold a weekly online video conference like this.
The speakers are basically our members,
and the topic is research results,
field review,
future development predictions,
sharing new ideas,
sharing new ideas,
and opportunities for cooperation.
TIRA is a fully self-funded,
volunteer organization.
Our staff are mainly PhD students and post-doctorate students,
or people like me,
who is in the limbo between a PhD student and a post-doctorate student.
You can see more details on our website.
If you want to see more,
you can go to our website.
I think the key point of a project like this
is to have open cooperation and opportunities for sharing.
The more people can join us and help each other,
the stronger we will be,
and the closer we will get to our goal.
If you are interested,
you are welcome to join our members
and support this idea
and share our research results.
We also have a Facebook page,
which I'm sure you all know.
This is a non-profit platform
for sharing.
I hope you can support us.
This is TIRA,
and this is Housekeeping.
Let's get started.
Today's speaker is Joey Hsiao-Qiao Ying.
Joey graduated from the University of Michigan,
and is now studying Information Science
at the University of Michigan.
He will give a more in-depth introduction later,
so I will be brief.
What he is interested in
is how to use
new technology to help immigrants.
I think this is US immigrant,
immigrants to the US.
How to help them adapt
to the new society.
Then there is a website.
If you are interested,
you can check it out.
It's beautiful.
There are a lot of details
about his current projects,
presentations, papers, publications.
I won't go into details today.
What I find interesting
about this website is
that it says
he is a believer of the strength of weak ties.
This is a background.
If you don't know what a weak tie is,
you should know what a strong tie is.
A strong tie is a social relationship
we have since we are born.
Some people are your parents,
some people are your children.
You can't change this.
You can't say no.
By definition, they are your parents.
But a weak tie is
when we are born,
but we can make friends,
find partners.
This is in line with
the spirit of Tyra's research.
It also says on the website
that he is a believer in weak ties.
He likes to make new friends
and share his research opportunities.
So please help him.
Give him a chance to make friends.
Without further ado,
let's give the stage to Joey.
Let's give him a round of applause.
Thank you.
Give me 10 seconds.
I'll change something.
Okay, take your time.
I'll say something else.
Give me another 10 seconds.
Okay.
If you have any questions,
you can leave them in the chat.
You can leave them in the chat.
I don't know if Joey can do it.
He might be watching his own video.
So he might not be able to see the chat.
So leave them in the chat.
He will look at your questions
and answer them.
So you can use the chat.
Okay.
Are you done?
Okay.
Are you done?
Do you have anything else to say?
No, I'm done.
Okay.
I'm going to share my video.
Can you see the video?
Yes.
Okay.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Joey.
Thank you for the introduction.
I'm a PhD candidate
at UMich.
I'm a PhD candidate
at UMich.
Today, I'm going to share
my research
and my final dissertation.
I'm going to call it
Not Only New Online,
but Also New Online.
Technology to Support Immigrant Access
to Social Capital Adaptation.
What I'm going to talk about
is that
this research itself
is not yet designed
to help immigrants with new technology.
It's easier to adapt.
The topic of today's talk
is still in the exploration stage.
We are looking for their needs.
What can we do
to promote
web design and app design
so that immigrants
can use technology more smoothly?
Let me talk about myself.
I just said
that I'm a PhD candidate
at UMich School of Information.
My field is
Human-Computer Interaction
and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.
We call it HCI and CSEW.
HCI is
Human-Computer Interaction.
In short,
we study how humans use technology,
and how technology affects humans.
We even discuss
how to influence human behavior
through design.
We often combine psychology,
human research,
and product design
to develop a foundation.
You may have heard of
User Experience, UX,
or Chinese User Experience.
UX and HCI overlap a lot.
The biggest difference is
HCI is usually used in academic research
to discuss
human-robot,
human-technology.
UX focuses on practical design
and emphasizes
how a product
can be used
on a commercial level
and how it can be used
through design.
HCI also has
Computer-Supported Cooperative Work,
CSEW.
CSEW focuses more on
human-to-human interaction
than traditional HCI
that focuses on
how technology affects
social,
community,
and human-to-human performance.
We often apply
social psychology
to our research.
My research
focuses on
newcomers.
Newcomers are people
who have moved
or traveled
to a new place
for the first time.
My research
focuses more on
immigrants,
but I'm most interested in
the newcomers.
I often use
the concept of
social capital
in my research.
Social capital means
you have friends
and social connections.
These social connections
can bring you
help and resources.
This is social capital.
Facebook
and other social media
have effectively
expanded
or enhanced
human social capital
and how people
can develop new social capital
and use social capital
to get new resources.
I'm interested in
social capital.
The third area
is related to
location-based
social media.
I'm interested in
location-based social media
because
compared to
technology,
location-based social media
can provide users
real-time information
and
provide users
real-time
social media
and
resources.
These are
the three areas
I'm interested in.
These are
the three areas
I'm interested in.
This is
a conference
I published
at CSCW
last year.
It's
technologies to
support immigration access
to social capital
and adaptation to
a new country.
Next slide.
Adaptation
focuses on
immigrants in the U.S.
Millions of immigrants
come to the U.S.
for work, education
or their
dream in the U.S.
Immigration is not
an easy process.
Immigrants
need to make adjustments
to adapt
to the new environment.
If adaptation fails,
they will face
mental health
or employment
issues.
In order to
successfully adapt,
immigrants need
to meet
many needs.
We compiled
four areas
in the past.
The four needs
immigrants need to meet
are
first,
they need to find
information
and resources
to meet their basic
needs.
Second,
they need to face
financial or
work issues.
They need to find
a job.
Third,
they need to
adapt to
a new culture
and language.
Finally,
immigrants need to
meet emotional needs
and
overcome
stress.
Looking back,
social capital
includes
social connections,
friends, family
and neighbors.
They can provide
resources through
social connections.
In the past,
social capital is
a very important
element in
immigration adaptation.
In order to
develop a new
social capital in
a new country,
immigration adaptation
is very important.
In the past few years,
people have said that
technology can help
immigrants develop
a new social capital
and get
more resources.
Some studies
show that
immigrants adapt
to a new
culture and language
through technology.
In the past,
most studies
focused on people.
In terms of technology,
it is not enough
to study
how technology
can change
or design
a new society.
My research
aims to
understand
how immigrants
can develop
a new society
through
technology.
My research
aims to
understand
how
technology
can help
immigrants
develop
a new
social capital.
What difficulties
immigrants face
through technology?
What concerns
immigrants face?
We have
designed a
qualitative study
to understand
immigrants.
Immigrants
come from
different backgrounds
and age.
