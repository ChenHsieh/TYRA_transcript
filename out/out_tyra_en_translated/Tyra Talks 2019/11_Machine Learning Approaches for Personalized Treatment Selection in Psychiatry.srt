1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you everyone for participating in this talk, this time we are very happy to invite Dr. Wu Qixing,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Dr. Wu Qixing is currently the director of psychiatry at NTU Hospital,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
he has a PhD and MD degree, his doctorate was obtained from NTU's Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He is currently doing research at Harvard Medical School,

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am very happy that he can bring a medical research that everyone cares about,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
how to use machine learning to help us make breakthroughs in personalized psychiatric diagnosis.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please give a round of applause to welcome Dr. Wu.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you everyone, I am very happy to have this opportunity to come here today to explain the results of the research.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Because the results of this research have not been officially released, the follow-up recording will probably be released to everyone in about half a year.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I graduated from medical school and got a doctorate in epidemiology,

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but later I found out that the field of machine learning is actually quite important,

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
so this year I had the opportunity to come to Harvard University to study further.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think everyone is very clear about the mental illness, especially the recent public television program,

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the distance between us and evil, this drama received a lot of response.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Friends overseas may not necessarily be able to see this drama,

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but in Taiwan, in fact, this drama has caused quite a lot of response.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We can see that the main character, Yin Sichong,

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
this patient is actually a young man,

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
but because of his illness, we can see that he seems to have become bald and no beard,

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and because he was quite excited, he was tied to the bed with his limbs restrained.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So this is when you get a relatively serious mental illness,

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
he may face a change in his whole life.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Originally, he may be like us, a young man studying and learning,

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but because of his illness, he interrupted the whole learning process.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If everyone's age is similar to mine, you may remember this movie called Beauty and the Beast.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It talks about the process of American mathematician John Nash.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He was also a very smart person, but when he was young, he had a visual impairment,

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
so his entire academic career was interrupted for a while.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This movie and book can be seen.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So the main disease I'm talking about today is probably schizophrenia.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In Chinese, it means a visual impairment.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
His past name was schizophrenia.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But because of this name, there was some misunderstanding,

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
so it was later changed to a visual impairment.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This disease is mainly studied for two reasons.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The first is that it is the most serious mental illness.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The second is that this disease itself,

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
we think it is a biological disease,

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
not because of a psychological defect or a psychological problem,

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
but because the brain is sick due to this disease.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The expression of this disease itself is that there are some delusions,

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
such as that someone wants to harm me,

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and then some people will have some hallucinations.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Obviously there is no sound next to him, but he keeps hearing someone talking to him,

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and he keeps hearing a lot of sounds.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Or when the whole brain is in a mess,

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
he will have some lost language and behavior,

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and he will stammer, speechless, and so on.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There are also some so-called negative symptoms.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For example, if an ordinary person is locked in a room without a book or a computer,

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
he may feel bored soon.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But when the negative symptoms are more serious,

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
he will become uninterested in everything and don't want to do anything.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You may just want to stare blankly,

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and then slowly become less and less words and less and less expressions.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This is the so-called negative symptoms.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The vitality that ordinary people have,

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the things they want to do will slowly disappear.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the negative symptom.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Generally speaking, the diagnosis of negative symptoms

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
is to make a diagnosis based on these statements.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The probability of survival is about 1% in the whole population.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The probability of survival is about 1% in the whole world.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we think this is a disease of the brain.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It won't have too much impact because of cultural differences.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For such a disease,

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in fact, we should choose the so-called antipsychotic treatment.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We will use this antipsychotic drug for treatment.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There are two meanings of this treatment.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
One is the control of symptoms.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When your brain has a lot of delusions and hallucinations,

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
we need to rely on this drug to let our delusions and hallucinations

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
be under control.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
When the symptoms get better,

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
in fact, we still have to take medicine.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What we need to do is relapse prevention,

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
which is to prevent relapse.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In some past studies,

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
people who stop taking medicine,

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
compared to those who continue to take medicine,

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the chance of relapse is about five times.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So whether or not to continue taking medicine is actually quite important.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
In some past therapeutic studies,

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
it was found that most people,

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
as long as they take medicine well at the beginning,

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
about 6% of the symptoms can be significantly improved.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But when you follow it for a longer time,

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you will find that

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
in fact, people with three to seven layers

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
need to change the medicine in the middle,

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
or they will stop the treatment.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There will be this situation within a year.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Either the drug has no effect,

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
or they feel that the drug has some side effects

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and they can't accept it,

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
or this group of people

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
lacks the sense of illness.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They think,

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm fine, I'm not sick,

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't want to take medicine anymore.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So this is a process that causes a lot of people to stop

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
or change their medicine.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Once you stop the medicine,

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
it's easy to relapse.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Once relapsed,

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the effect of the treatment is not so good.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So in fact, these people

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
often relapse slowly,

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and then slowly become a chronic disease.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So in a long-term follow-up study,

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
it was found that

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
less than 30% of people

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
can recover to normal function,

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
can complete their studies,

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and can go to work.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
For most people,

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
the chance of getting this disease is about 70% or 80% or more.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In fact, it becomes that there is no ability to work.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So these people,

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
in fact, a lot of people

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
need to go through a rehabilitation process in the later stage.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because their function is degenerated,

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
they can't work,

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
they can't study,

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
so they probably need to be in some nursing factories

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
or in some intensive care units

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to slowly do some rehabilitation,

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
so that they can

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
re-learn the ability to live.

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So once you get this disease,

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
if you don't treat it well at the beginning,

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in fact, the aftermath is quite bad.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In terms of drugs,

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in fact, in such drugs,

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
in Taiwan,

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
there are about 20 kinds of drugs,

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but if you look at the whole world,

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
there are about 40 kinds.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is a simple structure

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
chemical history.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Then we can know that

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
in fact, these drugs themselves

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
have a big difference.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Then they use this

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
according to the Neurotransmitter Affinity

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to look at their pharmacological properties.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You can also see that

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
like these drugs,

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in fact, they are in

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
different neurotransmitter substances

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
play different roles.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Some are for dopamine,

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
there is a very strong Mycin Affinity,

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
but in fact, some are weaker.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Instead, it is for other

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
serotonin,

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
polypinephrine,

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
there are some Mycin Affinity.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So in fact,

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
these drugs themselves

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
have a big difference in their pharmacological properties.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There are so many kinds of drugs.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In fact, in clinical trials,

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
we will probably divide these drugs

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
into two categories.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The first category is the first generation of drugs,

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
which is the drug developed

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
from the 1950s.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The second generation is probably around 1970-1980,

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
a drug that slowly emerged.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Approximately,

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
it has been around for about 30 years.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The first generation of drugs,

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in fact, the drug at the beginning

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
was found to be a more misdiagnosed drug.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
These drugs also have

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
more side effects on neurotransmitter.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
For example,

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
it will become stiff all the time,

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
tremble,

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
or even long-term side effects,

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
there will be so-called

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
tardive kinesia,

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
which is when the whole body becomes

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
involuntarily slow to move.

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The body will bend one side,

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the mouth will bend one side.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So the long-term results of taking medicine

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
will be more troublesome

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and difficult to treat.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
In addition, these drugs

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
will also have so-called more tardive kinesia,

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
or cause heart rate disorder,

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
as well as a rapid rise in myeloma.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There will be a lot of

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
problems with myeloma

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and myocardial infarction.

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The second generation of drugs,

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
in fact,

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because the first generation of drugs

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
has a lot of problems,

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so they went to do some

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
modern development,

204
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and began to see if we could

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
reduce the side effects of this drug.

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So at this time,

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
they began to reduce

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the side effects of myocardial infarction.

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So they mainly started to do some development.

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is the first drug of the second generation.

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But this drug, in fact,

212
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
was only listed in the United States

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
after a few years.

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It is mainly said that

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it has some serious side effects

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
that cause a decrease in body immunity.

217
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So these drugs

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
become, although there are,

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but not so easy to use.

220
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But slowly,

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
following this second generation of drugs,

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
to do some new eyes,

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
slowly new,

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
better and better second-generation drugs began.

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But these second-generation drugs

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
will also produce some

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
other side effects,

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
such as weight gain,

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
increase the risk of myocardial infarction.

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So these drugs look like

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
there are some quite different,

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but there is one good,

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
there is no good,

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
so each has its own

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
effect and side effects.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So how to choose so many drugs?

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In fact,

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
some people's efforts are to say,

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
hey,

240
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is it possible for me to find

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
a best drug to see?

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If everyone uses

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the best drug to treat first,

244
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
then if there is no effect,

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
then use the second best drug.

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is this possible to achieve

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the best effect?

248
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So in fact,

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
some people do a lot of

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
so-called meta-analysis.

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They collected more than 500

252
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
randomized control trials

253
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to do an analysis.

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Found that the best medicine

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is what we just talked about,

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the drug that has a lot of side effects,

257
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
colazapine, this drug.

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Then the second generation of drugs,

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the next drug,

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
there are also drugs such as

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
adminsupiride,

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
olanzapine, etc.

263
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It can be arranged like this.

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But in fact,

265
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
it's not that simple.

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Because in fact,

267
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
a drug itself,

268
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
in addition to this effect,

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
it also has the so-called side effects.

270
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In fact,

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the arrangement of side effects

272
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
is completely different.

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
For example,

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
the problem of weight gain.

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In fact,

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
for side effects,

277
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the higher the better,

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the lower the worse.

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
For example,

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
olanzapine

281
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
is originally a drug that

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
has a good effect,

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but in this part of weight gain,

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
it becomes a

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
side effect.

286
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a pretty big problem.

287
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Or,

288
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
this causes

289
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the side effects of glycogen.

290
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This colazapine,

291
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
this drug,

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
has almost no side effects

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
of glycogen.

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But other drugs

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
have a lot of side effects

296
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
of glycogen.

297
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So if we arrange it,

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
in fact,

299
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
we can't find

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
a perfect drug.

301
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Its effect is also very good.

302
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The side effects are also very good.

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In fact, it can't be found.

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
In fact,

305
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
these arrangements

306
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
are actually

307
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
a lot of variables.

308
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
These variables are quite complicated.

309
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So in fact,

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the side effects we need to pay attention to

311
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
in clinical trials,

312
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
may be six or seven

313
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
side effects.

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There are 20 kinds of drugs,

315
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
20 kinds of drugs.

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Each condition is different.

317
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Their side effects

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
are also

319
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
some differences in fiber.

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's not obvious,

321
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
but there are some

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
differences in fiber.

323
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
In addition,

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
each patient's characteristics are different.

325
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
For example,

326
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
a middle-aged man

327
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
may not care

328
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
so much

329
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
about weight gain.

330
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But if you say

331
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the subject of your treatment

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is a young woman,

333
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
weight gain

334
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
is a side effect

335
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
that he can't accept.

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Or,

337
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
a person himself

338
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
already has some

339
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
cardiovascular problems.

340
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If this drug

341
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
increases his

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
heart rate

343
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
or cardiovascular risk,

344
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
in fact,

345
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
this drug

346
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
is obviously

347
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
unsuitable for him.

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
In addition,

349
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the metabolism of this drug

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is the same.

351
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Some are

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the liver metabolism

353
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and some are

354
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
the kidney metabolism.

355
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So you need to

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
use his liver function

357
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to make

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
drug adjustments

359
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and treatments.

360
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
In fact,

361
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
there are too many

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
things to consider.

363
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But in clinical trials,

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
each doctor's experience

365
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is not so much.

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So in fact,

367
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
it's hard for us

368
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
to find a good

369
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
predictability

370
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
in clinical trials.

371
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So for most doctors,

372
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
it's probably

373
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that I may

374
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
make a choice

375
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
based on these points

376
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that I think are

377
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
more important.

378
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In fact,

379
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
will this choice

380
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
be successful?

381
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
To be honest,

382
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
we don't have much

383
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
confidence in our hearts.

384
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So we often say

385
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
try it first.

386
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So sometimes

387
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
we have

388
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
some ideas

389
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and reasons,

390
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
but will it

391
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
happen like this?

392
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
In fact,

393
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
we don't have much confidence.

394
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So this is

395
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
a very important

396
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
thing in

397
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
personal medical care.

398
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We have no way

399
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to know

400
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
what kind of person

401
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
is most suitable for

402
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
what kind of drug

403
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and find out

404
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
such a rule.

405
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So this is

406
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
a direction

407
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that everyone

408
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
is working on

409
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
at the moment.

410
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So there are

411
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
so many kinds of people.

412
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How do we

413
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
choose the

414
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
best drug

415
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
according to

416
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
each person?

417
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We started

418
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to learn

419
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
machine learning

420
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
mainly in

421
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
2016.

422
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is the

423
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
encouragement

424
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
of AlphaGo.

425
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
As we all know,

426
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
in fact,

427
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
we can

428
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
use the

429
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
developed

430
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
computer

431
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to defeat

432
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the world's

433
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
top players.

434
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So this is

435
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
the story

436
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
of AlphaGo.

437
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
In fact,

438
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
many people

439
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
are encouraged

440
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
by it.

441
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So in

442
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
all fields,

443
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
we hope to

444
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
use

445
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
machine learning.

446
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So our

447
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
current problem

448
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
is that

449
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
we have no way

450
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
to say

451
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
that we just

452
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
know that

453
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
there are

454
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
many different

455
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
characteristics

456
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
in the

457
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
human brain

458
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
.

459
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In fact,

460
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
there are

461
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
too many variables

462
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
that our

463
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
brain can't

464
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
learn.

465
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Can we

466
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
use

467
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
machine learning

468
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
to achieve

469
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
the goal

470
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
of personalized

471
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
medicine?

472
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This is

473
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
a direction

474
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
we want to

475
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
discuss.

476
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
In fact,

477
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
there are

478
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
more and more

479
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
medical applications

480
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
for machine

481
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
learning.

482
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
On the

483
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
one hand,

484
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
we know that

485
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
MRI

486
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
has a

487
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
fairly good

488
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
ability.

489
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
In fact,

490
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
there is a

491
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
lot of progress

492
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
in imaging

493
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
processing.

494
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So the

495
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
most used

496
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
is still

497
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
our

498
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
imaging

499
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
checkup,

500
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
such as

501
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
X-ray,

502
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
computer

503
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
CT,

504
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
or

505
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
MRI.

506
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
These

507
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
are actually

508
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
using

509
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
machine

510
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
learning to

511
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
help

512
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
our diagnosis.

513
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The speed

514
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
of

515
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
imaging

516
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and

517
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
machine

518
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
learning

519
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
is also

520
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
able to

521
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
achieve

522
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
this level.

523
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So

524
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the most

525
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
developed

526
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
is to

527
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
assist

528
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
doctors

529
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
in

530
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
diagnosis.

531
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
On the

532
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
other

533
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
hand,

534
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
we know

535
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that

536
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
machine

537
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
learning

538
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
can

539
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
determine

540
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
which

541
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
type it

542
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
is.

543
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So

544
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
the

545
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
ability

546
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
of

547
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
imaging

548
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
is

549
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
better

550
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
than

551
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the

552
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
past.

553
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Some

554
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
people

555
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
use it

556
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
to

557
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
predict

558
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
whether

559
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
a person

560
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
is

561
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
sick,

562
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
or

563
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
to

564
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
predict

565
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the

566
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
effect of

567
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
treatment.

568
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So

569
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
this is

570
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
what we

571
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
want to

572
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
do.

573
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We

574
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
hope that

575
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
people with

576
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the same

577
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
medical

578
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
care

579
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
can

580
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
benefit

581
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
each

582
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
other.

583
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This

584
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
is the

585
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
goal

586
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
of

587
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
personalized

588
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and

589
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
precision

590
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
medical

591
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
care.

592
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So

593
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
many people

594
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
know

595
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
about

596
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
machine

597
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
learning,

598
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
but

599
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I only

600
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
started

601
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
learning

602
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
about

603
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
machine

604
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
learning.

605
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So

606
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
we

607
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
are

608
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
learning

609
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
in different

610
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
ways.

611
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
For

612
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
example,

613
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
when we

614
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
learn how

615
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to identify

616
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
plants,

617
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
we

618
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
see

619
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
a lot

620
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of

621
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
plants,

622
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and

623
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
the

624
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
teacher

625
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
will

626
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
tell

627
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
us

628
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the

629
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
rules.

630
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And

631
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
we

632
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
can

633
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
find

634
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
apples.

635
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
In

636
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
the past,

637
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
we

638
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
used

639
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
this

640
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
method

641
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to

642
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
find

643
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
apples.

644
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But

645
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
when we

646
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
were

647
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
raising kids,

648
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we

649
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
realized

650
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
that

651
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
learning

652
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
wasn't

653
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
really

654
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
about

655
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
learning.

656
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So

657
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
we

658
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
told

659
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
him

660
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
the

661
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
rules

662
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
of

663
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
learning.

664
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
For

665
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
example,

666
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
we

667
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
told him

668
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
the

669
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
colors of

670
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
apples,

671
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but

672
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
he

673
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
would

674
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
know

675
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
which

676
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
one

677
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
was

678
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
the

679
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
apple.

680
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So

681
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
this

682
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
is

683
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the

684
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
essence

685
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of

686
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
machine

687
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
learning.

688
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There

689
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
are a

690
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
lot of

691
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
theories behind

692
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
this.

693
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But

694
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
generally,

695
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
we can

696
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
divide it

697
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
into

698
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
dozens

699
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
of

700
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
categories.

701
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
For

702
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
example,

703
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll

704
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
skip

705
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
these

706
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
categories

707
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
first.

708
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We'll

709
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
talk about

710
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
them

711
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
later.

712
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But

713
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
for now,

714
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
deep

715
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
learning

716
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
is

717
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
about

718
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
whether

719
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
it's

720
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
useful

721
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
in

722
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
epidemiology.

723
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We

724
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
don't

725
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
know.

726
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So

727
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
we

728
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
don't

729
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
know

730
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
whether

731
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it's

732
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
useful

733
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
in

734
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
epidemiology.

735
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So

736
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
machine

737
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
learning

738
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
is

739
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
not

740
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
just

741
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
about

742
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
learning.

743
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Some

744
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
people

745
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
think

746
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it's

747
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
about

748
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
whether

749
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
it's

750
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
useful

751
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
in

752
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
epidemiology.

753
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So

754
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
we'll

755
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
use

756
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
a lot

757
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
of

758
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
decision

759
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
making

760
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
methods.

761
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
For

762
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
example,

763
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
we'll

764
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
vote

765
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to see

766
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
if it

767
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
works.

768
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This

769
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
is

770
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
called

771
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
vegging.

772
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Some

773
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
methods are

774
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
boosting.

775
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This

776
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
is a

777
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
concept.

778
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Some

779
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
are

780
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
staking.

781
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We

782
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
use different

783
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
learning

784
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
methods.

785
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
For

786
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
example,

787
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
simple

788
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
memorization,

789
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
written

790
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
forest,

791
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
or

792
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
machine

793
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
learning.

794
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We

795
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
do

796
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
a

797
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
second

798
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
learning

799
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to see

800
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
if it

801
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
works

802
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
better than

803
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the

804
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
first

805
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
learning.

806
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So

807
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
staking is

808
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
like

809
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the guardian.

810
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Everyone has

811
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
different

812
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
special

813
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
functions.

814
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But

815
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it's

816
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
basically

817
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
a very

818
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
strong

819
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
team.

820
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So

821
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
for now,

822
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
staking

823
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
is not

824
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
certain,

825
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but

826
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
the

827
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
final

828
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
results

829
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
are

830
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
probably

831
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
better than

832
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the

833
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
first

834
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
learning.

835
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
We

836
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
use

837
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
different

838
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
methods

839
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and

840
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
theories.

841
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But

842
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
where does

843
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
the data

844
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
come from?

845
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
In

846
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Taiwan,

847
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
we have

848
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
a few

849
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
large

850
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
data

851
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
that

852
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
we can

853
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
use.

854
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The

855
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
most

856
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
common

857
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
is

858
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the

859
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
health

860
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
care

861
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
database.

862
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So

863
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
if I

864
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
don't

865
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
see a

866
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
doctor,

867
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
they

868
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
won't

869
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
tell me

870
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
how much

871
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I weigh,

872
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
unless

873
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I see

874
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
a doctor.

875
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So

876
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
the

877
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
data

878
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
is not

879
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
that

880
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
complete.

881
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
There

882
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
are

883
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
other

884
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
important

885
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
data.

886
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
For

887
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
example,

888
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I

889
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
don't

890
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
smoke,

891
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
so

892
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I

893
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
don't

894
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
eat

895
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
anything.

896
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So

897
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
the

898
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
data

899
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
is

900
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
not

901
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
that

902
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
complete.

903
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So

904
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the

905
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
data

906
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
is not

907
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that

908
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
complete.

909
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The

910
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
data

911
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
is not

912
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that

913
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
complete.

914
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So

915
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
we

916
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
don't

917
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
use

918
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
that a

919
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
lot.

920
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So

921
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I

922
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
don't

923
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
eat

924
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
anything.

925
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So

926
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
the

927
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
data

928
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
is not

929
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that

930
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
complete.

931
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So

932
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
we

933
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
don't

934
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
eat

935
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
anything.

936
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So

937
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
we

938
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
don't

939
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
eat

940
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
anything.

941
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So

942
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
the

943
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
data

944
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
is not

945
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
that

946
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
complete.

947
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So

948
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the

949
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
data

950
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
is not

951
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that

952
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
complete.

953
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So

954
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the

955
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
data

956
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
is not

957
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
that

958
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
complete.

959
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The

960
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
data

961
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
is complete.

962
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So

963
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
the

964
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
data

965
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
is not

966
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
complete.

967
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So

968
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
the

969
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
data

970
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
is

971
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
not

972
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
complete.

973
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So

974
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
the

975
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
data

976
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
is

977
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
not

978
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
complete.

979
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So

980
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
the

981
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,920
data

982
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,000
is not

983
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
complete.

984
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So

985
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
the

986
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
data

987
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
is not

988
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
complete.

989
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So

990
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the

991
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
data

992
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
is not

993
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
complete.

994
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So

995
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
also

996
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
those

997
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
data

998
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that

999
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
we

1000
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
are

1001
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
having

1002
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
should

1003
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
not

1004
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
be

1005
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
complete.

1006
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So

1007
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
the

1017
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So

1018
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000

1028
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So

1029
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000

1039
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So

1040
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000

1050
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So

1051
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000

1061
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So

1072
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
the

1226
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So

1227
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000

1237
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So

1238
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000

1248
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So

1249
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000

1259
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So

1260
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
the

1435
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So

1436
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000

1446
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So

1447
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000

1457
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So

1458
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000

1468
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So

1479
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So

1490
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
the

1644
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So

1645
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000

1655
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So

1656
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000

1666
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So

1667
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000

1677
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So

1688
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So

1699
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
the

1844
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000

1853
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So

1854
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the

1864
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So

1865
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
the

1875
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So

1876
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000

1886
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So

1887
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000

1897
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So

1898
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000

1908
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
the

2053
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000

2062
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So

2063
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
the

2073
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So

2074
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000

2077
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
we

2084
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So

2085
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000

2095
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So

2096
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000

2106
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So

2107
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000

2117
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So

2118
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000

2128
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So

00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
the

2271
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So

2272
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000

2282
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So

2283
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000

2293
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So

2294
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000

2315
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So

2326
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
the

2480
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So

2481
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000

2491
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So

2492
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000

2502
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So

2503
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000

00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
the

2689
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So

2690
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000

2700
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So

2701
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000

2711
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So

2712
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000

2909
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So

2920
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000

00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
the

3107
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So

3108
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000

3118
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So

3119
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
the

3129
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So

3130
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000

3140
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So

3141
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000

3151
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So

3162
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So

01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
the

3316
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So

3317
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000

3327
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So

3328
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000

3338
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So

3339
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000

3349
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So

3350
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000

3360
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
So

01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
the

3525
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
So

3526
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the

3536
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
So

3537
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
the

3547
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So

3548
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000

3558
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So

3559
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000

3569
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So

3570
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000

3580
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So

01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
the

3734
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So

3735
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000

3745
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
So

3746
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000

3756
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So

3757
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000

01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
the

3934
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
data

3935
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
that

3936
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
we

3937
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
are

3938
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
having

3939
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
should

3940
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
not

3941
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
be

3942
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
complete.

3943
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So

3944
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
the

3945
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
data

3946
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
that

3947
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
we

3948
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
are

3949
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
having

3950
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
should

3951
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
not

3952
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
be

3953
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
complete.

3954
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So

3955
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
the

3956
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
data

3957
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
that

3958
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
we
