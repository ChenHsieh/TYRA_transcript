00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TaroTalk.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today, we have Dr. Su Gongyi with us.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is the first time I've called him that.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He's going to talk to us about his research in Caltech.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today's topic is Cosmic Rays or Turbulence Can Suppress Cooling Flow

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Where Thermal Heating, Momentum Injection, or Non-HGN Solutions Fail.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's get started.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm going to talk about Cosmic Rays or Turbulence Can Suppress Cooling Flow.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is my research in Caltech.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is my co-author.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll start with the cooling flow problem.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In a large galaxy or galaxy cluster,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
we usually observe very strong X-ray luminosity.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This means there's a lot of gas emitting a lot of energy.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This means there's a lot of gas emitting a lot of energy.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So a lot of gas is getting colder.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we should expect to find a lot of cold gas in the middle of the galaxy.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But in fact, we can't find that much cold gas.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So where does that gas go?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The gas may be getting colder and colder.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And then there's a lot of stars.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's a lot of star formation.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But on the other hand, we find that

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
these big galaxies or galaxy clusters

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
have very low star formation rates.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They're basically all been crunched.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So this tells us

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that there must be something

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that generates heat

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to re-heat these gases.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Otherwise, based on so many

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
inferred cooling flow rates,

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we can't consistently find

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
so little cold gas or stars.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So this is the problem.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We've observed so much cold gas,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but we can't find the same amount of cold gas.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So this tells us that there must be something

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
that can re-heat the gas.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In the simulation,

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
this problem is called the cooling flow problem.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In the simulation, the cooling flow problem

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is most likely to generate too much star formation.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you don't have any other mechanism

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to suppress cooling flow,

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the gases will keep cooling down

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and accrete into the center of the galaxy

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and generate too much star formation.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So you can see that this is a galaxy

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
with 14 times the solar mass

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and has a cooling flow problem.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can see that in Redshift-0,

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the star formation rate is probably

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
more than 2 times the observed magnitude.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Can you hear me? Hello?

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The cooling flow problem is typical.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
As I said earlier,

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it occurs in relatively heavy galaxies.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So you can see that this plot is stellar mass

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
versus halo mass.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Halo mass is the mass of dark matter.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The horizontal axis is the mass of stars in the galaxy.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you assume that all the baryons,

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
all the gases and all the substances

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
follow the dark matter,

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the flow follows the dark matter

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and all of them become stars,

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
then you can predict the virtual line.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can see that

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
after a very high-quality galaxy,

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the green lines below are observed.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can see that

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
in a large-scale galaxy,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
there will be a very large deviation.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The larger the deviation, the more obvious it is.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is where the cooling flow problem begins.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Usually, the scale occurs in L-star galaxies,

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which is probably above the Milky Way-sized galaxy.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The cooling flow problem will become more and more serious.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In the literature,

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
there are some ideas that everyone proposes,

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
which can possibly suppress the cooling flow

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and solve the cooling flow problem.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
These proposals include

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Stata Feedback,

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Fully Microphysics,

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Cosmic Ray,

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
which is the cosmic ray from the supernova,

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
which is the cosmic ray from the supernova,

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
or Morphological Quenching,

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
or AGM Feedback.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AGM Feedback is the feedback

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
generated by the supermassive black hole

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
in the middle of the galaxy.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
To be more specific,

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Stata Feedback,

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
which is more likely to be related to the cooling flow problem,

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is Type Ionized Supernova, or AGB Wings.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
AGB Wings is a Stata Wing,

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
which is the continuous energy generated by the galaxy.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It will heat up or provide momentum to the surrounding gas.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Type Ionized Supernova,

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
which is the supernova explosion of older stars,

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is usually Type Ionized Supernova.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We care more about AGB Wings

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
or Type Ionized Supernova

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
because these galaxies,

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
as I just said,

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
these massive galaxies are usually quenched,

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
so their star formation rate is very low.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So very few stars are just produced.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Most of the stars are very old stars.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
These older stars,

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
their Stata Wings are usually AGB Wings.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Type Ionized Supernova is usually Type Ionized Supernova.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
These things can provide energy to the surrounding gas,

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and either kick them to a place

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that is farther away from the center of the galaxy,

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
or re-heat them.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Another possibility is Fluid Microphysics.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This includes magnetic field, conduction,

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
especially magnetic field and conduction.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Magnetic field can provide additional energy

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and provide additional pressure

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to suppress the cooling flow.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is another possibility.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Indeed, in some parts of the galaxy,

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
we can see that the magnetic field's energy density

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is similar to the thermal energy density

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
in Equipartition.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So the magnetic field is very important.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Another possibility is Conduction.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If the conduction is very strong,

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
usually the picture looks like this.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When gas starts to move from the universe

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to a place where the potential of the galaxy is affected,

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
it will be shocked to a higher temperature.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So the higher the quality of the star,

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the higher the temperature will be.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So if the conduction is very strong,

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
it can transfer the heat from the hot part

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
to the cold part in the middle,

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and then re-heat the gas that has been cooled to the middle.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So conduction is also a proposed idea in the literature.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It is possible to solve the cooling flow problem.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The third one is Cosmic Current Supernova.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Cosmic Current is usually generated by shock.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because Supernova provides a lot of energy,

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
it will shock the gas next to it,

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and then there will be a lot of protons

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
being added at a higher speed.

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What we are talking about here is mainly related to

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the Cosmic Current Proton of GEV.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Usually 10% of Supernova Energy

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
may be generated in the form of Cosmic Current.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
On the one hand, Cosmic Current can heat the surrounding gas.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There may be Streaming in the channel.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Streaming is when the Cosmic Current and gas

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
are not completely synchronized,

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
it will generate all kinds of instability,

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and then through this instability,

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
it will dissipate energy and heat the surrounding gas.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
On the other hand, there is the Hadron Collider.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That is, the Cosmic Current will collide with the gas,

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and energy will be generated in this respect.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then there is Pressure Support.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Cosmic Ray also provides extra pressure.

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It can also suppress the cooling flow,

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
preventing the gas from moving in the middle of the star system.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Another proposed idea is Morphological Clutching.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
On the one hand, we observe that

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
when the distribution of stars is relatively round,

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the star formation rate is usually lower,

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and the star formation rate is higher when the distribution is more disc-like.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But someone also proposed that

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
maybe we just need to change the distribution of the star system,

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
so that the gas can be stabilized,

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then it will not move in the middle of the star system,

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and it can suppress the cooling flow,

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
suppress the speed of star formation,

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and then solve this problem.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The part on the left is non-AGM feedback,

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
which is the mechanism that has nothing to do with the huge black hole in the middle of the star system.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
On the other hand,

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the most popular idea is AGM feedback.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AGM feedback is the feedback generated by the huge black hole in the middle of the star system to the surrounding gas.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This picture is like this.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
When the gas continues to accrete into the black hole in the middle,

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
some of the energy will be fed back to the surrounding gas.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
On the one hand, it may provide momentum,

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
or gas around the heating,

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
or gas around the shock,

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and produce a lot of cosmic rays.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
On the other hand, it may also stir those gases,

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and then produce more turbulence,

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and then it may also suppress the cooling flow.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In my next talk,

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will gradually say why these on the left are not important.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The feedback on the right is related to AGM feedback,

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
which is the feedback related to the huge black hole in the middle of the star system.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It may be more important,

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
especially the two aspects of cosmic rays and turbulence.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is my next talk outline.

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I will first talk about how we set up these simulations.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Then I will talk one by one,

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
such as Stata Feedback,

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Fluid Microphysics,

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Cosmic Ray,

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Morphological Quenching,

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and AGM Feedback.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I will talk one by one,

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
why each one is important or not.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is the setup of the simulation.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We study this problem.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
As I just said,

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
this problem is usually more important in galaxies with a quality higher than L-star galaxy.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
L-star galaxy is probably the Milky Way-sized galaxy.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Its solar mass is about 10 to 12 quadrilaterals.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We have tried three cases,

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
10 to 12 quadrilaterals,

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
10 to 13 quadrilaterals,

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and 10 to 14 quadrilaterals.

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We use Idealized Isolated Galaxy Simulation.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We made our own galaxy,

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and then we started from an initial condition.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Then we add different feedback,

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
or as I just said,

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
those physics go in,

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and then our initial condition is the initial condition based on observation.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If you don't have any mechanism to suppress the cooling flow problem,

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the cooling flow problem will occur.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
As shown in the previous picture,

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
there will be too much star formation.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So if you let the initial condition evolve,

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
it will soon be inconsistent with the observation.

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We use this initial condition,

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and then we add the static feedback,

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
free microphysics,

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and AGM feedback.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We try to see if there is any way to maintain it in the simulation,

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
to maintain it in line with the observation.

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The cooling flow will not be too strong,

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and there will not be too many stars.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
In our initial condition,

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
we have pre-set,

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and based on the observation,

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
we manually set the Dark Matter Halo,

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the star,

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the Static Disk,

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the Static Bulge,

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and the Gas Disk.

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is the gas around the star,

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and we have a pressure-supported Hot Halo,

255
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
which is the entire star,

256
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
this huge amount of star,

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
there will be a gas Halo covering the entire galaxy,

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the entire galaxy.

259
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Basically, it should be pressure-supported,

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the pressure compensates the gravitational force,

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and it should be a pressure-supported Hot Halo,

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
this is our initial condition.

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The picture on the right shows that

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the axis on the left is X-ray Luminosity,

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and the axis on the right is Halo Mass.

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
These three black dots are our initial conditions.

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You can see that

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
the X-ray Luminosity is based on the observed data.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In our simulation,

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
we use Gizmo,

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
which has gravity,

272
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and all kinds of feedback are already in there,

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and there will be a Hydro Code.

274
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
As for the Star Feedback,

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
we use the FIRE Star Feedback Model,

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
which is a very good Star Feedback Model.

277
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It includes Supernova,

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Star Winds,

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Photonization,

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Photoelectric Heating,

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and Radiational Pressure.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
For the cooling of the gas,

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
we follow it from 10K to 12-14K,

284
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
so the gas can cool from 12-14K to 10K.

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We use different cooling methods to cool the gas.

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
As for the Star Formation,

287
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
when the gas cools and becomes dense,

288
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
it can produce stars.

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We only allow the gas to meet the following conditions.

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The gas must be self-gravitating and molecular,

291
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and its density must be greater than 100 particles per cubic centimeter,

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
so that it can produce stars.

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As for Cosmic Ray,

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
we model it as an extra fluid,

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
assuming that it is in line with the flow of the Hydro Code,

296
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and we try to model it as GEV Cosmic Ray.

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Cosmic Ray can do some things,

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
such as PDP work,

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
which means that it will have pressure

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and will make contact with other gases.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It will diffuse to the surroundings,

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and it will have a relative movement with the gas,

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
which will produce various kinds of stability,

304
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and will lose some energy,

305
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and heat up these gases.

306
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Similarly, it will collide with the gas,

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and it will heat up those gases,

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and it will lose Cosmic Ray energy,

309
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
but it will provide heat energy to the gas.

310
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
First, let's talk about Static Feedback.

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Is Static Feedback useful for cooling flow problems?

312
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
As we said, we have 12 quadrants, 13 quadrants, 14 quadrants,

313
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and three different runs.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We usually enable M12, M13, and M14.

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We have two different simulations for M12 and M13.

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The first one is Default Run,

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
which has FIRE Static Feedback,

318
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
which also includes Static Feedback.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The other one is No Feedback Run,

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
which has no Static Feedback.

321
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
As we said, in Static Feedback,

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
we believe that Type Ionized Supernova

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and AGB Wink are more important,

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
so we added more.

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
In addition to Default Run,

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
which has Static Feedback and No Feedback Run,

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
we also have Type Ionized Supernova Run.

328
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We only enable Type Ionized Supernova.

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Static Feedback has various channels,

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
so we only enable Type Ionized Supernova in this run.

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
In the other run, we only enable AGB Wink.

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Then we start running from Initial Condition

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
based on the relative situation.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's see what the result is.

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This is the result.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
This is the result based on the situation mentioned above.

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The result is the star formation rate,

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
which is the speed of the star formation.

339
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can see that the biggest difference is the black line.

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The black line is the run with all Static Feedback.

341
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The red line has no Static Feedback,

342
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
which means there is no Static Feedback at all.

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The difference between the two is mainly in the beginning.

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Without Static Feedback,

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
the gas stored in the center of the star will cool down very quickly

346
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and then explore the center of the star

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and produce too many stars.

348
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You can see that there is a very high star formation rate at the beginning.

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
After the gas in the middle is gradually used up,

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the remaining star formation is

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
then from the gas at a further distance from the beginning

352
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
to the cooling flow

353
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and then cool down to the center of the gas to produce stars.

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You can see that even though Static Feedback

355
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
suppressed the star formation rate at the beginning,

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
but later, at the end of the simulation,

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you can see that in all the runs,

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the star formation rate is still very high,

359
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
from several solar max per year to dozens of solar max per year.

360
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It can't completely solve the cooling flow problem.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It still produces too many stars.

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Can you talk about the nominal observational rate you want to get?

363
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Generally, a crunched galaxy can be suppressed to 10 to 0,

364
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
which is less than one solar max per year,

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
especially a 14-dimensional or larger galaxy.

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But dozens of solar max per year is definitely too high.

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay, go ahead.

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So Static Feedback can't solve the cooling flow problem.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In all the runs, you can see that

370
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
at the end of the simulation,

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the star formation rate of Static Feedback is getting smaller and smaller.

372
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And no matter what, it still produces more than 10,

373
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
especially in more massive galaxies,

374
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
which are more than 10 to 14 solar max per year.

375
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
On the other hand, you can see that

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
only the run of Type Ion and Supernova

377
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and only the run of AGB Wind,

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
which is the red line and the light blue line,

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
in the case of 14 dimensions,

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
the star formation history,

381
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the process of star formation,

382
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
is basically the same as without feedback.

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
In other words, the contribution of Type Ion, Supernova, and AGB Wind is very small.

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why is that?

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
On the other hand,

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
we are trying to quantify

387
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
how many variables,

388
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
which are not documented,

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
are in the middle of the galaxy.

390
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So the first line is quantified,

391
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
which is the Baryonic mass in the middle of the galaxy,

392
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and its evolution over time.

393
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You can see that

394
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
all the Baryonic mass changes over time

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in the 30-kpc sphere,

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
in the 30-kpc sphere in the middle of the galaxy.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You can see that it goes up, of course.

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If there is no stellar feedback,

399
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
you can see that the Baryonic mass

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
basically has no change in its evolution.

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
There are still so many gas,

402
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
so many baryons,

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
floating in the middle of the galaxy,

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
which is constantly rising.

405
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Its rate of rise has not changed,

406
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
regardless of whether you have stellar feedback.

407
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
On the other hand,

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
we can see that the second line is quantified,

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
which is the hot gas,

410
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
which is the hotter gas,

411
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
over all the Baryonic mass.

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What is the ratio?

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can see that

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
there is no stellar feedback,

415
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and its hot gas

416
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
basically has no change.

417
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The third line is changed.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The third line is cold gas or Baryonic mass,

419
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
which is the cold gas

420
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
in the Baryonic mass.

421
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You can see that

422
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
there is no stellar feedback.

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Basically, very little gas

424
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
is in the cold gas phase.

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Its ratio is very low.

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What happens?

427
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
When the gas cools down,

428
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
if there is no stellar feedback,

429
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
it will quickly turn into a star.

430
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then you will have too many stars.

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But this also shows that

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
your stellar feedback

433
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
basically changes

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
how much cold gas

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
turns into a star,

436
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
but it does not change

437
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
how much hot gas,

438
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and it does not change

439
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the total Baryons

440
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
in the middle of the galaxy.

441
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So you didn't solve the cooling flow problem.

442
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You just changed

443
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
the ratio between the cold gas

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and the stars.

445
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You didn't change

446
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the Baryons

447
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
in the middle of the galaxy.

448
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So you didn't solve the cooling flow problem.

449
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Why is

450
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the cooling stellar feedback

451
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
not efficient?

452
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Here we use

453
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the M14 galaxy

454
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
to explain.

455
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In the upper left corner,

456
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
we plot the

457
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
total cooling rate

458
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
as a function of time.

459
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
In the upper right corner,

460
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
we plot the total energy input,

461
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
which is the energy provided by stellar feedback.

462
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You can see that

463
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
all the energy provided by stellar feedback

464
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
is not enough

465
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
to compensate for the cooling.

466
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The stellar feedback

467
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
is to provide energy

468
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
to either move the gas farther away,

469
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
or provide the surrounding gas

470
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
in the form of motion or heat.

471
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But the gas loses energy

472
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
with a greater rate,

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and the cooling rate is always higher.

474
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So in this situation,

475
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
stellar feedback cannot provide

476
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
enough energy to compensate

477
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
for the cooling.

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So the cooling flow problem will continue to occur.

479
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But if you try to quantify

480
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
how much energy

481
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
all kinds of stellar feedback contribute,

482
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
in the lower panel,

483
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
the lower left corner is the energy

484
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
contributed by Supernova,

485
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and the lower right corner is the energy

486
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
contributed by Stellar Wind.

487
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The first line corresponds to

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
the energy produced by younger stars.

489
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The second line corresponds to

490
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the energy produced by older stars.

491
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
As you can see,

492
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
because stellar feedback

493
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
does not fundamentally solve

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
the cooling flow problem,

495
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the star condition is still very high.

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So the most energy

497
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
in this simulation

498
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
is still the energy

499
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
generated by the supernova explosion

500
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
of younger stars.

501
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So this is still the maximum energy.

502
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But even if you have

503
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
so many young supernova explosions,

504
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
the energy generated

505
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is still far less than the cooling rate.

506
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Because

507
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the energy generated by

508
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
those older stars is

509
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
not only Type Ia Supernova,

510
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
but also AgV Wind.

511
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So it is impossible

512
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
for Type Ia Supernova

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and AgV Wind

514
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to have too much influence

515
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
on the cooling flow.

516
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
This also explains why

517
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
we only run Type Ia Supernova

518
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and AgV Wind.

519
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The star condition history

520
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
is basically the same

521
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
without any feedback.

522
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I have a question.

523
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Hello?

524
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Hello?

525
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Hello?

526
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I can't hear you.

527
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What's wrong?

528
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Hello?

529
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Hello?

530
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I can hear you.

531
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
How are you?

532
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Hello?

533
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I just cut off.

534
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Sorry. Can you hear me?

535
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I can hear you.

536
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
There are some spikes on the two curves.

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The spikes are actually very large.

538
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The spikes on the log scale are bulging like this.

539
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What is that?

540
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Do you know the other three lines below?

541
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Which spikes are you talking about?

542
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The two lines

543
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
in the upper left panel

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
are the default

545
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and low metallicity.

546
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Default

547
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and low metallicity.

548
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So the cooling rate is...

549
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm talking about those

550
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
small edges.

551
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's not that large.

552
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's just that

553
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
there are some fluctuations

554
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
based on the gas

555
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
at that time.

556
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So it's not a special event.

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You think it's just

558
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a normal fluctuation.

559
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, I think it's normal.

560
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I didn't look closely.

561
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's probably the same as my average time scale.

562
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But yeah, it's probably just...

563
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh, okay.

564
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I thought it was a special event.

565
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And the other three are not.

566
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
No, I think it's okay.

567
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay, okay.

568
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay, thank you.

569
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah, those two

570
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
have a complete set of feedback.

571
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Maybe it's just that time.

572
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The set of feedback is a little stronger.

573
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Or there's some gas

574
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that's denser, and the cooling rate is stronger.

575
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I didn't look closely.

576
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But I think it's okay.

577
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's not that big.

578
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Usually, there are some fluctuations at the scene.

579
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That's another question.

580
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The set of feedback is another question.

581
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It may actually provide energy

582
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
to the Galaxy

583
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to reheat the gas.

584
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But in fact,

585
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
it also produces a lot of metal.

586
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
In astronomy, when we say metal,

587
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
we mean any element

588
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
greater than helium.

589
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Any element greater than helium.

590
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Because the set of feedback

591
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
produces a lot of heavier elements.

592
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
These heavier elements

593
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
can make the cooling rate

594
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
cooler.

595
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It makes the gas easier to cool.

596
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
On the left,

597
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
we see two lines.

598
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
One line is the default run.

599
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's a normal run.

600
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
The other line is where we deliberately

601
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
put its heavier elements

602
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
in the Galaxy.

603
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's very, very low.

604
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You can see if there's any of these metals.

605
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Its star formation rate

606
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
can actually be quite different.

607
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So,

608
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
these metals are basically

609
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
consistently from the set of feedback.

610
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, we can say that

611
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the set of feedback

612
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
is basically possible to

613
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
make the cooling flow problem

614
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
worse.

615
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because these heavier elements

616
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
induce the gas to cool down.

617
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So, the set of feedback doesn't work.

618
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's look at magnetic field conduction

619
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in Cosmic Graviton Supernova.

620
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So,

621
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
let's look at these heavy elements one by one.

622
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
In the case of 10, 12, and 13,

623
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
we have a default run.

624
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It has a fire set of feedback.

625
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It only has a fire set of feedback.

626
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It doesn't have any other fully microphysics.

627
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We also have another all-microphysics run.

628
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It has a fire set of feedback,

629
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
magnetic field, conduction, and viscosity.

630
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In the Galaxy of 10, 12, and 14,

631
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
in addition to the default

632
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and all-microphysics run,

633
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
we have another run,

634
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
which is all-microphysics plus Supernova.

635
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
In addition to the all-microphysics run,

636
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we have a fire set of feedback,

637
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
magnetic field, conduction,

638
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and viscosity.

639
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We also have 10% of Supernova energy

640
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
in Cosmic Graviton.

641
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I have a question about

642
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Supernova.

643
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm actually very surprised

644
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
that this is a hypothesis.

645
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because this can be estimated,

646
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
right?

647
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
If you observe the rate,

648
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
you can estimate the energy budget.

649
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You can see the luminosity

650
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and know the rate.

651
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Can you estimate the energy budget

652
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
to solve this problem?

653
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Or is it just a qualitative

654
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
possibility?

655
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
When we were doing this project,

656
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
we basically believed

657
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that this was impossible to solve.

658
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Some papers

659
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
tried to propose

660
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that Supernova

661
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
had enough energy.

662
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Their approach was

663
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
to compare the total cooling rate

664
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
in the center of the star

665
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
with the energy input

666
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
of the stellar feedback.

667
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
They found that

668
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
the stellar feedback

669
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
had enough energy.

670
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But our point is

671
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
that even in the very,

672
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
very middle part,

673
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it's possible that it's enough.

674
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
In fact, the gas

675
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
next to it is very, very large.

676
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
In the outer part,

677
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
the gas will continue to cool

678
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and go to the center of the star.

679
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But your star is only

680
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in the center of the halo.

681
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So you should calculate

682
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the entire cooling rate

683
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
of the entire halo,

684
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
not the cooling rate

685
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
where the star is distributed.

686
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Because you are

687
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
highly biased to

688
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
this kind of very, very localized

689
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
calculation.

690
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Their estimate

691
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
is that

692
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the energy input

693
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and cooling rate

694
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
in the center of the star

695
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
will continue to cool

696
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and go to the center of the star.

697
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So you should compare

698
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the entire cooling gas.

699
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We think that

700
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
this is not enough.

701
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And our simulation

702
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
can't solve this problem.

703
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Okay, you go on.

704
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It depends on how you solve it.

705
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Thank you.

706
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So here we have

707
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
magnetic field conduction

708
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
with viscosity and cosmic ray.

709
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
This is the star

710
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
we simulated.

711
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Is there any magnetic field?

712
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The black line

713
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
has no magnetic field conduction,

714
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and the blue line

715
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
has magnetic field conduction.

716
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
In the smaller galaxy,

717
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
there is magnetic field

718
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
conduction.

719
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You can see that

720
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
the star condition

721
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is a little less,

722
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
but only a little.

723
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
With cosmic ray,

724
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
the star condition

725
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
is slightly reduced,

726
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
but it is the same.

727
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
As time goes by,

728
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
you can see that

729
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
in the later time,

730
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
the star condition

731
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
is basically the same

732
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
as without cosmic ray.

733
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If you continue to quantify

734
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
how much gas

735
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
is in the middle of the galaxy,

736
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
the bottom line is

737
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
total baryonic mass as a function of time,

738
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and the top line is

739
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
hot gas mass over baryonic mass.

740
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You can see that

741
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
with magnetic field conduction,

742
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
it is possible that

743
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
the total baryonic mass

744
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
in the middle of the galaxy

745
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
may be slightly suppressed

746
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
by magnetic field conduction,

747
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
but it is not

748
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
the difference between

749
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
the two.

750
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
There is no way to

751
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
solve this problem.

752
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
With cosmic ray,

753
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
you can see that

754
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the gas in the middle

755
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
is slightly heated,

756
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
but it is not

757
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
the difference between

758
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
baryonic mass and

759
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
baryonic mass.

760
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Basically,

761
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
you can't solve

762
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
this problem.

763
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Why can't we solve

764
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
this problem?

765
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We have seen the

766
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
results of the simulator.

767
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The energy per unit mass

768
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
is in different energies.

769
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The red line is thermal energy,

770
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
the blue line is magnetic energy,

771
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
the black line is turbulent energy,

772
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and the blue line is

773
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the energy distribution

774
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
as a function of radius,

775
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
which is how far

776
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the energy distribution

777
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
is from the center of the galaxy.

778
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The first line is the energy distribution,

779
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and the second line is

780
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
the energy distribution

781
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
over thermal energy,

782
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
which is how important

783
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
it is compared to thermal energy.

784
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You can see that

785
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
in most of the radius,

786
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
the energy distribution

787
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
is much smaller than

788
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
thermal energy.

789
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The energy distribution

790
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
in the middle

791
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
is not so different,

792
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
but in the cooling flow

793
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
area,

794
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
the energy distribution

795
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
is much smaller

796
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
than thermal energy.

797
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This limit

798
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
can't affect

799
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the cooling flow

800
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in the cooling area.

801
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Why doesn't conduction

802
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
affect the cooling flow?

803
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
On the one hand,

804
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
some of the reasons are

805
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
that conduction

806
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
is heat transfer

807
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and it depends on

808
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the direction of

809
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the temperature gradient.

810
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But basically,

811
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the particles with heat

812
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
are all charged particles,

813
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
so they are trapped

814
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
in the direction of the magnetic field.

815
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So basically,

816
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
if you want the thermal gradient

817
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
to be in one direction

818
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and the magnetic field

819
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
to be in the other direction,

820
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the direction of the conduction

821
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
will be projected

822
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
to the direction of the magnetic field.

823
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This projection

824
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
will reduce

825
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the effective conductivity.

826
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Let's estimate

827
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
how much this reduction

828
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
is.

829
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The middle part

830
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
reduces the effective conductivity

831
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
by at least half,

832
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and the outer part

833
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
reduces it by 1 or more thirds.

834
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So this is one way

835
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
to explain why

836
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the conduction

837
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
is not very important

838
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
in our simulation.

839
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Let's talk about

840
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
the morphological environment.

841
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
For some people,

842
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the distribution from

843
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
a disc to a boat

844
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
is a more elliptical distribution,

845
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
so the gas is stabilized

846
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and you don't have

847
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
too many stars.

848
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
In our simulation,

849
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
we directly change

850
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the distribution of stars

851
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
in the initial condition.

852
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The black line and the gray line

853
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
have feedback run,

854
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and the black line is

855
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the normal distribution.

856
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The gray line is

857
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the elliptical distribution.

858
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We also try

859
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
the no feedback run,

860
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
which is the red line

861
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and the peach red line.

862
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We also change the distribution

863
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
of stars.

864
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You can see that

865
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
if you slightly change the distribution of stars,

866
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
you can slightly change

867
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the initial

868
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
start of the simulation.

869
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But at the end of the simulation,

870
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
all the run

871
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
are saturated

872
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
to a very high level.

873
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Basically, you just change

874
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
the distribution of stars

875
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
without changing the

876
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
final start of the simulation.

877
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But why is this

878
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
not important?

879
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There is no way to solve this problem.

880
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Basically,

881
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
it depends on whether

882
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
your gas is stabilized

883
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
or it will continue to

884
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
become denser

885
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and generate stars.

886
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Basically, we often estimate

887
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a rotationally supported gas.

888
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We estimate its thermal Q.

889
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
This is Scale S.

890
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Omega is its angular velocity,

891
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and the sigma of the mole

892
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
is its surface density,

893
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
which is the density of the unit area.

894
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Usually, if this number

895
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
is less than 1,

896
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
it means that

897
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
its density is relatively zero.

898
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
If this number is greater than 1,

899
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
it means that

900
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
it will continue to expand

901
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and generate more density

902
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and generate stars.

903
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
If this number is greater than 1,

904
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it means that

905
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
it is a relatively stable situation.

906
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You can see that

907
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
if you keep changing the distribution

908
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
of stars,

909
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
if you change the shape

910
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
of the same quality star

911
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
slightly,

912
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
the result is that

913
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
you slightly change its angular velocity.

914
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You can imagine that some stars are

915
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
distributed in the shape of a circle or a disk.

916
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The gravitational potential will change slightly,

917
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but you only slightly change

918
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the effect of

919
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
the order of unity.

920
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
However, your cooling flow

921
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
provides more gas

922
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
to the center of the star.

923
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Basically, you can do

924
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
the surface density,

925
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
which is the density of the unit area.

926
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
If you keep changing the distribution of stars,

927
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it means that

928
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
you will change the order of unity,

929
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
because your cooling flow

930
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
will continue to put more gas

931
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
into the center of the star.

932
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So eventually,

933
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
although you can slightly reduce

934
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the distribution of stars,

935
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
your cooling flow will

936
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
make the distribution of stars

937
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
bigger and bigger.

938
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So eventually,

939
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
the total Q is always less than 1.

940
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I have a question.

941
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
In these two simulations,

942
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you only changed the distribution

943
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
of baryonic stars, right?

944
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yes, I only changed the distribution

945
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
of stars.

946
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So you didn't change

947
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the dark matter halo, right?

948
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
No, I didn't change the dark matter.

949
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But for example,

950
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the disk galaxy and the circular one,

951
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
the reason why they become like this,

952
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
their mechanism...

953
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But this is a proposed idea.

954
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He said that

955
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the difference in the distribution of stars

956
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
causes the cooling flow problem.

957
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But I tell you that

958
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
although you observe

959
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
the disk galaxy,

960
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
its star formation rate is higher,

961
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
its bulge galaxy,

962
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
its star formation rate is lower,

963
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
but this correlation

964
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
is not causal.

965
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's not that you just have to change

966
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
the distribution of stars,

967
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
you can change the star formation.

968
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh, okay.

969
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So logically, I can accept it.

970
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But this is what I think.

971
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If the galaxy morphology

972
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
is different today

973
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
because its dark matter halo is different,

974
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
if you want to study

975
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
such a mechanism,

976
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
shouldn't you also change the halo?

977
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Although I don't know what the halo looks like,

978
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is it possible?

979
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It's possible because of the halo.

980
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Or even because, for example,

981
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
your AGM feedback,

982
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
the K-dome around you,

983
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the feedback generated by the surrounding gas

984
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
caused the change,

985
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
or the merger,

986
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
or the change caused by two stars

987
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
together.

988
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Now, no matter why

989
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the distribution of stars

990
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is like this,

991
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
we can't directly solve

992
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
the distribution of stars,

993
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and we can't change

994
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the star formation rate.

995
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We have to prove that this logic is not true.

996
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I agree with this conclusion.

997
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Okay, thank you.

998
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
If you directly put in

999
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
some numbers,

1000
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
you only need

1001
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
about 3 x 10 to the power of 14 solar mass

1002
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
in the middle of 10 kVc.

1003
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The gas surface density

1004
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
will be high enough

1005
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to self-shield.

1006
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The surrounding gas will not be affected

1007
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
by other radiation,

1008
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and it can cool down to a very low temperature

1009
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
of 10 to the power of 14 kVc.

1010
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
If you put these numbers in,

1011
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
you can get a much lower temperature

1012
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
of 10 to the power of 14 kVc.

1013
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
These numbers are very easy to achieve,

1014
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
so eventually your gas

1015
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
will become very dense

1016
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and continue to flow

1017
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
into the middle of the galaxy

1018
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
without solving any problems.

1019
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay, so we've talked about

1020
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
all the mechanisms

1021
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that are not AGM feedback

1022
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
proposed in the literature.

1023
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
In this regard, we talked about

1024
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Static Feedback, Magnetic Field Conduction,

1025
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Cosmic Reverse Supernova,

1026
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
and Nucleophage Quenching.

1027
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I believe I just

1028
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
tried to convince everyone that

1029
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
none of them can work.

1030
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
They all still have cooling flow problems.

1031
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Their gas transformation rates are still too high.

1032
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Eventually,

1033
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
they are still the same

1034
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and not the same as observations.

1035
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So none of them work.

1036
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Next, let's move on to AGM feedback.

1037
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
AGM feedback is

1038
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
the feedback of a huge black hole

1039
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
in the middle of the galaxy

1040
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
to the gas around it.

1041
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
A complete AGM feedback model

1042
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
should be able to consistently

1043
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
model how much gas

1044
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
runs to the black hole

1045
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
in the middle,

1046
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and how much energy

1047
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
is fed to the gas around it.

1048
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But it is very

1049
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
model-dependent.

1050
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Instead of

1051
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
jumping directly

1052
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
into a model

1053
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
we believe in,

1054
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
we try to do a bigger

1055
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
parameter search.

1056
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
We don't care

1057
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
how much gas

1058
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
or stars

1059
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
run to the black hole

1060
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
in the middle of the galaxy.

1061
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
We only care about

1062
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the gas around the black hole.

1063
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
For example,

1064
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
if we add different

1065
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
types of energy

1066
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
to the black hole,

1067
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
what will happen to the gas

1068
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
around the black hole?

1069
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Basically,

1070
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
we inject energy

1071
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
from the black hole

1072
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
in different forms

1073
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and intensities

1074
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
to different radii

1075
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
to see if there is

1076
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
a scenario

1077
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
where we can

1078
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
suppress the star formation rate

1079
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and quench the galaxy.

1080
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
If the galaxy is successfully quenched,

1081
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
does it mean that

1082
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
the energy produced

1083
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
in the galaxy

1084
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
is equivalent to

1085
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
the energy produced

1086
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
in the black hole?

1087
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Is the energy

1088
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
we need

1089
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
in the black hole

1090
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
a reasonable amount

1091
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
of energy

1092
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
to produce

1093
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
four different types

1094
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
of energy

1095
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
in the black hole?

1096
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The first is momentum,

1097
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
which can provide

1098
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
a lot of kinetic energy

1099
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
to the gas around the black hole

1100
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and then kick it

1101
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
to a far away place.

1102
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The other form is

1103
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
thermal energy,

1104
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
which can heat

1105
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the gas around the black hole

1106
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
in various ways

1107
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
such as radiational heating.

1108
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It can heat the gas

1109
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
around the black hole

1110
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
to a higher temperature.

1111
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The other form is

1112
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
turbulent stirring,

1113
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
which can stir the gas

1114
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
around the black hole

1115
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
to produce currents

1116
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
in the black hole.

1117
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It can also

1118
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
make the gas

1119
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
around the black hole

1120
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
more turbulent

1121
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and more difficult to collapse.

1122
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This is another possible form.

1123
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The other form is

1124
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
cosmic ray,

1125
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
which can

1126
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
shock the gas

1127
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
around the black hole

1128
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
to produce

1129
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
cosmic rays.

1130
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
This is another

1131
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
possible form

1132
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
of energy.

1133
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
If it is momentum,

1134
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
it can heat

1135
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
the gas around the black hole

1136
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
to a higher temperature.

1137
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
There are three possible forms

1138
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
of thermal heating.

1139
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The first one is

1140
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
uniformly heating

1141
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
all the gas

1142
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
in the galaxy.

1143
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The other one is

1144
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
only heating

1145
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
the gas

1146
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
around the black hole

1147
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
to a higher temperature.

1148
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The third one

1149
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
is

1150
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
heating

1151
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
all the gas

1152
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
in the galaxy

1153
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
to a higher temperature.

1154
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The fourth one

1155
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
is

1156
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
heating

1157
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
all the gas

1158
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
around the black hole

1159
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
to a higher temperature.

1160
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The fifth one

1161
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
is

1162
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
heating

1163
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
all the gas

1164
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
around the black hole

1165
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
to a higher temperature.

1166
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The sixth one

1167
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
is

1168
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
heating

1169
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
all the gas

1170
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
around the black hole

1171
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
to a higher temperature.

1172
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The seventh one

1173
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
is

1174
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
heating

1175
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
all the gas

1176
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
around the black hole

1177
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
to a higher temperature.

1178
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The eighth one

1179
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
is

1180
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
heating

1181
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
all the gas

1182
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
around the black hole

1183
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
to a higher temperature.

1184
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
The ninth one

1185
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
is

1186
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
heating

1187
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
all the

1188
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
gas

1189
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
around the black hole

1190
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
to a higher temperature.

1191
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
This is because

1192
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
the diffusion coefficient

1193
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
determines

1194
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
how much

1195
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
cosmic ray

1196
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
stays in the middle

1197
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
of the galaxy.

1198
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So how much cosmic ray

1199
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
stays in the middle

1200
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
determines how much chance

1201
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
the cosmic ray will

1202
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
collide with other gas

1203
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and produce gamma ray.

1204
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Since the total flux of

1205
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the gamma ray in the galaxy

1206
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
has a limit,

1207
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
the diffusion coefficient

1208
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
determines how much

1209
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the cosmic ray will

1210
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
stay in the middle

1211
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
of the galaxy.

1212
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Based on the speed of the

1213
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
earthquake,

1214
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
you can calculate

1215
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
the radius of

1216
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
the cosmic ray

1217
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
which will

1218
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
be around

1219
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
20-30 kpc.

1220
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It will start to thermalize.

1221
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
The cosmic ray energy

1222
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
will gradually heat up.

1223
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
First, let's look at

1224
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
the momentum injection.

1225
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
This is the flux

1226
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
of 36 quadrillion

1227
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
CGS.

1228
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
This is the result of

1229
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
sharp motion ray.

1230
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
When the momentum is not very strong,

1231
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
it does not affect

1232
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
the galaxy at all.

1233
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
However, when the momentum

1234
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
flux reaches 36 quadrillion

1235
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
CGS,

1236
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
it turns off

1237
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
all sharp motion rays.

1238
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You can see that

1239
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
the green line is not

1240
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
on the plot at all.

1241
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
However,

1242
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
the gas in the middle

1243
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
of the galaxy is blown away.

1244
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You can see that

1245
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
there is no gas

1246
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
in the middle of the galaxy.

1247
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You can see that

1248
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
there is no gas in the middle of the galaxy.

1249
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You can stop the cooling flow

1250
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and stop the sharp motion ray.

1251
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You can stop the sharp motion ray.

1252
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
You can also blow away

1253
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
all the surrounding gas.

1254
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It is not consistent with observation.

1255
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Next, thermal heating.

1256
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
We have

1257
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
uniform heat up gas.

1258
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
By gas heating,

1259
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
it is confined to

1260
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
30 kpc or only heating

1261
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
the particles around the black hole.

1262
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The energy flux of the four of us

1263
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
is about 10 to the power of

1264
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
43 to the power of

1265
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
45.

1266
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
The first one you see

1267
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
is the produced

1268
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
sharp motion ray

1269
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
based on the energy flux and the different kernel size.

1270
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The first one you see is the produced sharp motion ray based on the energy flux and the different kernel size.

1271
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
If you heat up these gases uniformly,

1272
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
you basically have no effect.

1273
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Even if you have a very high energy,

1274
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
it doesn't affect the sharp motion ray.

1275
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But if you put the same energy

1276
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
in the middle,

1277
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
heat up to 30 kpc

1278
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
or

1279
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
put all the energy

1280
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
in the middle of the black hole,

1281
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
you can have a very big effect on the sharp motion ray.

1282
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You can see that

1283
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
the more energy you put in the middle,

1284
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
the stronger the

1285
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
sharp motion ray suppression

1286
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
you can produce

1287
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
with the same energy.

1288
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
For example, in the black hole neighborhood,

1289
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
you can suppress the sharp motion ray

1290
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
with very little energy.

1291
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
In fact, there are some results

1292
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
that are inconsistent

1293
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
with observation.

1294
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
In the first column,

1295
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
we draw the density profile.

1296
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
In the second column, we draw the temperature profile.

1297
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
In the third column, we draw the turbulent velocity

1298
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
as a function of radius.

1299
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
At the end, you see that uniformly

1300
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
heat up the gas,

1301
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
all the lines are still the same as the black curve.

1302
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
In fact, there is no change

1303
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
in the energy input.

1304
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
But if you put all the energy

1305
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
in the gas next to the black hole,

1306
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
the effect is very explosive.

1307
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
For example, in the second column,

1308
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
you can see that

1309
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
the temperature in the middle

1310
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
can be added to a very high level.

1311
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
In addition,

1312
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the gas is also added

1313
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
to a very high level.

1314
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
In other words,

1315
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
the gas temperature is too high

1316
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and the speed is too fast.

1317
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
In fact,

1318
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
if you take

1319
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
a medium-value kernel

1320
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and distribute the thermal heating energy

1321
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
to about 30 kpc,

1322
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
you can make it

1323
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
a little more stable.

1324
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Your energy will not be so high

1325
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
or your speed will not be so fast.

1326
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But you will still produce

1327
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
a negative temperature gradient.

1328
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The middle is hotter and the outside is colder.

1329
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Basically, this is not the same as observation.

1330
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Basically, the observation is

1331
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
that the middle is colder and the outside is hotter.

1332
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The temperature gradient

1333
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
is not the same as observation.

1334
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
If you really look at

1335
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
your energy,

1336
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
we draw this picture

1337
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
that you integrate

1338
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
your cooling rate

1339
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
from the middle to a certain radius

1340
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and your heating rate

1341
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
from the middle to a certain radius.

1342
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
The heating rate is the red line

1343
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and the cooling rate is the blue line.

1344
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The first thing you can compare

1345
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
is that if you uniformly heat up the gas

1346
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
from the top two lines,

1347
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
basically

1348
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
most of your heating

1349
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
is at the

1350
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
outermost gas.

1351
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But if you put all

1352
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
the heating in the middle of the galaxy,

1353
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the heating rate in the middle

1354
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
will be much larger than the cooling rate.

1355
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Basically, this is why

1356
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
you will have a very explosive result.

1357
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
If you use

1358
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
a kernel like 30kpc,

1359
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
you can distribute

1360
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
these heating to about 30kpc.

1361
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Indeed, in some situations,

1362
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
you can make your heating rate

1363
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
slightly

1364
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
similar to your cooling rate

1365
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
in a larger radius,

1366
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
but the result is very fine-tuned.

1367
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And even if you are very fine-tuned,

1368
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
you will still have problems

1369
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
with your cooling rate.

1370
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So basically,

1371
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
if you just want to use thermal heating

1372
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
to compensate the cooling flow,

1373
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
you don't need to be very fine-tuned.

1374
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
You just need to make sure

1375
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
that your heating rate

1376
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
is exactly the same as the cooling rate

1377
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
in each location of the galaxy.

1378
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Otherwise, you will easily heat up

1379
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
some parts of the galaxy

1380
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
or produce a very explosive result.

1381
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So it's very fine-tuned.

1382
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Although it may work,

1383
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
it may not work.

1384
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Next, let's talk about

1385
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Cosmic Ray Injection.

1386
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Cosmic Ray has

1387
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
streaming instability

1388
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and heats up the gas.

1389
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It also collides with the surrounding gas

1390
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
and produces hydronic and coulomb heating.

1391
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Diffusion is set to 12.9 quadrillion

1392
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
units of CGS.

1393
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Energy input is

1394
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
between 12.4 quadrillion

1395
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and 12.4 quadrillion.

1396
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
These are

1397
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
very efficient

1398
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
to suppress shock measurement.

1399
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You can see that

1400
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
if you add energy

1401
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
in the form of Cosmic Ray

1402
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
to the surrounding gas,

1403
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
you can still

1404
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
efficiently suppress

1405
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
shock measurement.

1406
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
If you look at

1407
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
the density profile

1408
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
and temperature profile,

1409
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the reason why

1410
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
shock measurement is suppressed

1411
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
is because the temperature

1412
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
is a little higher than

1413
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
the surrounding gas.

1414
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
If you add the same amount

1415
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
of energy

1416
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
to the surrounding gas,

1417
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
one side is

1418
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
in the form of

1419
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Cosmic Ray,

1420
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and the other side

1421
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
is in the form of

1422
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
hydronic,

1423
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
you can see that

1424
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
in the form of Cosmic Ray,

1425
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
it reduces

1426
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
the density

1427
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
in the middle of the galaxy.

1428
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Basically,

1429
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
in the form of Cosmic Ray,

1430
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
it suppresses

1431
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
shock measurement

1432
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
more efficiently than

1433
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
in the form of hydronic.

1434
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
This range is still

1435
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
acceptable.

1436
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I want to clarify

1437
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
something.

1438
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
What do you mean by hydronic?

1439
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Hydronic means that

1440
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
the particle in that place

1441
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
is now bigger than

1442
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
V2,

1443
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
but it is basically

1444
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
a thermalized movement.

1445
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Do you have anything

1446
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
that can transfer energy

1447
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
from one to another,

1448
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
such as thermal radiation?

1449
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
No.

1450
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We just say that

1451
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
the heat energy

1452
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
of the particle

1453
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
does not generate

1454
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
an average momentum

1455
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
in a specific direction.

1456
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
No.

1457
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Another extreme

1458
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
is Cosmic Ray,

1459
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
because all your energy

1460
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
has a very clear

1461
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
momentum direction.

1462
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
No.

1463
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Our model is

1464
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Lagrangian-based code,

1465
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
so each particle

1466
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
may be thousands of solar mass

1467
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
or 10,000 solar mass.

1468
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
We model

1469
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Cosmic Ray in the fluid limit,

1470
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
so it has a field

1471
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
that is heat energy,

1472
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and it has a field that is Cosmic Ray.

1473
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
We directly add its energy

1474
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
to Cosmic Ray's field.

1475
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Cosmic Ray

1476
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
is the same as

1477
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
general heat energy.

1478
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It has a couple of hydrodynamic equations.

1479
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Cosmic Ray

1480
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
will do PDV work on gas.

1481
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It also has energy loss.

1482
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Cosmic Ray energy loss

1483
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
in the channel,

1484
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
such as collision heating

1485
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
or streaming instability.

1486
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It will reduce

1487
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Cosmic Ray's energy

1488
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
and turn it into heat energy.

1489
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh, I see.

1490
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Thank you.

1491
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Why can Cosmic Ray

1492
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
do this?

1493
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
On the one hand,

1494
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
there is a possibility

1495
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that Cosmic Ray

1496
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
directly heats the gas.

1497
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Cosmic Ray

1498
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
may be streaming heating

1499
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
or collision

1500
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and heat the gas.

1501
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
However,

1502
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
the panel below

1503
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
is accumulative heating.

1504
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
We directly integrate

1505
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
various channels

1506
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
of Cosmic Ray's possible heating gas

1507
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
from streaming

1508
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
to collision

1509
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
or loss.

1510
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
The black line

1511
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
is the input of

1512
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
all Cosmic Ray's energy.

1513
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
As you can see,

1514
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
there are not many Cosmic Ray

1515
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
that turn into heat energy.

1516
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Especially in

1517
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
the case of

1518
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Star Formation,

1519
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
which has been suppressed

1520
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
and Quench.

1521
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You can see that

1522
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
less than 10% of Cosmic Ray

1523
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
turns into heat energy.

1524
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
If you try to compare

1525
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
the heat generated

1526
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
by Cosmic Ray

1527
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
from the middle to a certain radius

1528
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
and the cooling rate

1529
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
from the middle to a certain radius,

1530
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
you can see that

1531
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
the energy input

1532
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
from Cosmic Ray

1533
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
is less than the cooling rate.

1534
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
This tells us that

1535
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Cosmic Ray's heating

1536
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
is not the main reason

1537
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
for suppressing

1538
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Star Formation or Cooling Flow.

1539
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
The heat provided

1540
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
is not enough.

1541
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Cosmic Ray also provides

1542
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
pressure support.

1543
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It provides another form

1544
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
of pressure

1545
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
that pushes the gas

1546
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
to the middle.

1547
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
We found that

1548
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
this is important.

1549
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
If you try to calculate

1550
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
two forces,

1551
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
the first force is

1552
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
the gravitational force.

1553
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
The other force is

1554
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
the pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray.

1555
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
If there is a pressure gradient,

1556
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
you will produce something like a buoyancy

1557
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
that pushes the gas outward.

1558
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
If you try to see

1559
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
the difference between

1560
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
the buoyancy of Cosmic Ray

1561
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and the gravitational force,

1562
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
you can see that

1563
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
under such a coefficient,

1564
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
the energy input

1565
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
is about four to three times

1566
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
greater than the

1567
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray.

1568
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You can see that

1569
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
the red line below

1570
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
is the gravitational force

1571
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
per unit mass,

1572
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and the black line

1573
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
is the energy input.

1574
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
You can see that

1575
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
under such a coefficient,

1576
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
the energy input

1577
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
is about four to three times

1578
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
greater than the

1579
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
gravitational force

1580
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
per unit mass.

1581
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
In this case,

1582
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
you can prevent the gas

1583
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
from moving to the middle

1584
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
of the galaxy.

1585
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
The pressure gradient

1586
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
of Cosmic Ray

1587
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
can suppress star formation

1588
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
because of the

1589
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray,

1590
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
not because Cosmic Ray

1591
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
heats up the gas

1592
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
around it.

1593
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Finally,

1594
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
let's talk about

1595
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
turbulence.

1596
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Let's not ask where the

1597
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
source of turbulence comes from.

1598
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Of course, it may be HMDB,

1599
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
or it may be for other reasons.

1600
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Anyway, let's stir the gas externally

1601
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
in a 100 kV mode.

1602
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
We have uniformly stirred

1603
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
the gas run.

1604
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
There is no space difference

1605
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
between the first two runs.

1606
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
We have a core-turbulent

1607
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
core run,

1608
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
which is the gas in the center of the galaxy.

1609
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
We try to make

1610
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the energy input greater

1611
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
than 100 kV

1612
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
in the form of turbulence.

1613
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
From 1 to 4,

1614
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
the gas in the center of the galaxy

1615
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
is getting stronger and stronger.

1616
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The energy is getting higher and higher.

1617
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
From 1 to 4,

1618
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
the gas in the center of the galaxy

1619
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
is getting stronger and stronger.

1620
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
This is the result of

1621
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
star formation history.

1622
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
The upper panel is uniformly stirred

1623
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
the gas case.

1624
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
The lower panel is the case

1625
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
in the center of the galaxy.

1626
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
As you can see,

1627
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
the gas in the center of the galaxy

1628
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
is getting stronger and stronger.

1629
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
This is the result of

1630
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
star formation history.

1631
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
In fact,

1632
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
there are some things

1633
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
that are different from observation.

1634
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
For example,

1635
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
if you uniformly stir the gas,

1636
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
there is no space difference

1637
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
between the first two runs.

1638
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It is very easy for you

1639
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
to put too much energy

1640
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
into the outer part of the galaxy.

1641
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
The actual luminosity

1642
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
is much lower.

1643
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
This is not the same as observation.

1644
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
On the other hand,

1645
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
if you stir the gas

1646
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
too hard,

1647
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
you will also

1648
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
increase the speed

1649
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
of the gas.

1650
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Mach number is

1651
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
the speed over

1652
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
the sound speed.

1653
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Sound speed is

1654
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
the speed

1655
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
corresponding to the temperature.

1656
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
If you stir too hard,

1657
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the Mach number

1658
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
will be out of unity.

1659
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Of course, this is not the same as observation.

1660
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
However, in addition to these extreme situations,

1661
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
there is still some space

1662
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
to suppress

1663
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
star formation history.

1664
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
On the one hand,

1665
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
you still maintain the state

1666
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
that is basically the same as observation,

1667
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and you can also

1668
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
suppress star formation rate

1669
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and cooling flow.

1670
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So why does turbulent stirring

1671
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
work?

1672
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
There are several possible reasons.

1673
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The first one we might think of

1674
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
is that you stir the gas

1675
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
and it produces some currents.

1676
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Those currents

1677
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
may eventually dissipate into heat.

1678
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
These things

1679
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
may eventually turn into heat

1680
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and the temperature of the gas

1681
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
will increase.

1682
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
On the other hand,

1683
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
when we stir the gas externally,

1684
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the input energy

1685
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
is much less than

1686
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
the energy dissipation energy

1687
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
of the gas,

1688
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
at least less than 1%.

1689
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So the energy produced

1690
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
by the channels

1691
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
that turn the currents into heat

1692
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
is far less than

1693
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
the cooling flow.

1694
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
We found that the more important reason

1695
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
is mixing.

1696
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
When you mix gas,

1697
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
on the one hand,

1698
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
you mix the cooled gas

1699
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
into the CGM,

1700
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
into the gas

1701
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
with lower density.

1702
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
If you check

1703
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
the gas,

1704
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
the gas with high density

1705
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
at first,

1706
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and check

1707
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
how much of it

1708
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
is dense

1709
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and the temperature is low,

1710
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and how much of it

1711
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
is hot,

1712
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
you can see that

1713
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
half of the gas

1714
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
is stirred externally.

1715
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You stir

1716
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
the gas

1717
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
to a higher radius

1718
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
or to the gas

1719
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
with lower density.

1720
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So mixing

1721
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
is mixing

1722
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
the cooler gas

1723
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
with the denser gas

1724
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
with lower density.

1725
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
We found that this is the more important reason

1726
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
why it can suppress the cooling flow

1727
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and suppress star formation rate.

1728
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
On the other hand,

1729
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
because you stirred these gases

1730
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
and you provided

1731
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
the extra turbulent pressure,

1732
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
the gas density

1733
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
in the middle of the galaxy

1734
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
is also reduced.

1735
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So you reduce the gas density

1736
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and also reduce the cooling rate.

1737
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Because the cooling rate

1738
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
is equal to the square of the gas density,

1739
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
the gas density is reduced

1740
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and the cooling rate is also reduced.

1741
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
The cooling rate is also reduced

1742
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
and the cooling time is also longer.

1743
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
So this is another very important reason

1744
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
because the density

1745
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
in the middle of the galaxy is reduced.

1746
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So we just talked about

1747
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
turbulent and cosmic ray

1748
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
can be more stabilized,

1749
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
stably suppressed.

1750
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Cooling flow and star formation rate

1751
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
are also in the case of 12 and 14 square.

1752
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
We also try to

1753
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
simulate thermal heating

1754
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
if you confine it in a

1755
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
more open space.

1756
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It seems that the thermal energy can also work.

1757
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
We try to put these three runs

1758
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
in a smaller galaxy,

1759
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
12 square, 12 square, 13 square,

1760
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
see if it can work.

1761
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
These three runs are the ones we just said

1762
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
are the slightly more successful runs in 12 and 14 square.

1763
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Let's try to see if these three models

1764
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
can work in a smaller galaxy.

1765
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Let's see if these three models can work.

1766
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
For the thermal heating part,

1767
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
we scale

1768
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
its total energy input

1769
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
according to the

1770
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
cooling rate of all its

1771
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
gases.

1772
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We scale our energy input

1773
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
to a smaller galaxy.

1774
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
We also make the kernel size

1775
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
correspond to the size of the galaxy

1776
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
and make the corresponding reduction.

1777
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
For the Cosmic Ray Injection run,

1778
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
we directly put

1779
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
the thermal energy input

1780
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
corresponding to the

1781
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
cooling rate of the

1782
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
corresponding galaxy.

1783
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
For the Turbulent Stirring run,

1784
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
we first put

1785
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
the scale of the stirring mode

1786
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and the kernel size

1787
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
corresponding to the size of the galaxy

1788
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
and make the corresponding scale.

1789
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
We also put the force of your foot

1790
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
corresponding to the circular velocity

1791
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
above your foot's scale

1792
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and make the corresponding scale.

1793
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Because the size of the galaxy is different,

1794
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
the energy input and the scale input

1795
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
are different.

1796
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
This is how we scale.

1797
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
As you can see,

1798
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
this is the star formation history

1799
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
of the 10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.

1800
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
As you can see,

1801
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
the Cosmic Ray Injection

1802
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
can crunch the galaxy

1803
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
in all cases

1804
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and the star formation rate

1805
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
is very low.

1806
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
As for the thermal heating,

1807
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
it only works for the

1808
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.

1809
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It doesn't affect

1810
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
the 10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.

1811
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
The star formation rate

1812
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
is still very high.

1813
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
As for the Turbulent Stirring,

1814
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
it can only suppress

1815
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
the star formation rate

1816
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1817
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
13th, and 14th galaxies.

1818
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It doesn't affect

1819
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.

1820
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It just makes the star formation rate

1821
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
jump up and down.

1822
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Why is that?

1823
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Why doesn't the

1824
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies

1825
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
have the same effect

1826
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
as the Turbulent Stirring and

1827
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Thermal Heating?

1828
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
First, let's look at Thermal Heating.

1829
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
In the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies,

1830
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
many gases

1831
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
don't have high temperatures.

1832
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
The temperature

1833
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
of the 10th, 12th,

1834
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and 14th galaxies

1835
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
is around

1836
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
12°C to 12°C.

1837
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
These gases

1838
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
are the main

1839
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
cooling rate of

1840
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
gases.

1841
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Thermal Heating

1842
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
also provides

1843
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
energy input,

1844
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
but it also

1845
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
heats up

1846
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
more heavy elements

1847
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and denser gases

1848
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
to this temperature.

1849
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
The gases

1850
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies

1851
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
cool down very quickly.

1852
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Many gases

1853
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
are placed in the same position,

1854
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
which increases

1855
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
the cooling rate.

1856
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
The picture on the right

1857
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
shows the cooling rate

1858
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
of the radio-integrated gases.

1859
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
The cooling rate

1860
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
is from the center of the galaxy

1861
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
to the outer part of the galaxy.

1862
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
The black line shows

1863
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
no energy input.

1864
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
The red line shows

1865
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
thermal heating.

1866
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
The thermal heating

1867
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
provides energy,

1868
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
but it also increases

1869
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
the cooling rate

1870
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.

1871
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The cooling rate

1872
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
increases

1873
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
the cooling rate

1874
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1875
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and 14th galaxies.

1876
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The cooling rate

1877
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
is not that much higher

1878
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1879
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
and 14th galaxies.

1880
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
The cooling rate

1881
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1882
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and 14th galaxies

1883
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
is not so much higher

1884
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1885
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
and 14th galaxies.

1886
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The movie on the left

1887
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,820
shows the

1888
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
cooling rate

1889
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1890
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
and 14th galaxies.

1891
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
The upper left corner

1892
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
shows the temperature

1893
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1894
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
and 14th galaxies.

1895
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
At the end of the simulation,

1896
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
you can see

1897
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
a lot of gas

1898
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
being heated

1899
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and rising

1900
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
to a higher position.

1901
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
However,

1902
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
when it reaches a higher position,

1903
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
it cools down

1904
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
and starts to

1905
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
rise again.

1906
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
This is a demonstration

1907
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
of the cooling rate

1908
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1909
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
and 14th galaxies.

1910
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
The cooling rate

1911
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1912
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
and 14th galaxies

1913
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
is not that much higher

1914
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1915
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
and 14th galaxies.

1916
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The cooling rate

1917
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1918
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and 14th galaxies

1919
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
is not that much higher

1920
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1921
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
and 14th galaxies.

1922
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
and the cooling rate

1923
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1924
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
and 14th galaxies

1925
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
is not so high

1926
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1927
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and 14th galaxies.

1928
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
the cooling rate

1929
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1930
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and 14th galaxies

1931
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
is not so high

1932
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1933
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and 14th galaxies.

1934
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
the cooling rate

1935
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1936
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and 14th galaxies

1937
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
is not so high

1938
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
in the 10th, 12th,

1939
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and 14th galaxies.

1940
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and the cooling rate

1941
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
in the 10th, 12th.

1942
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
galaxies

1943
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
has a 때도

1944
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
which means

1945
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
just applying

1946
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
as long as your kernel size

1947
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
is not so low

1948
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
around 50 kbz

1949
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
turbulent stream can still work

1950
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
in the 12th and 14th galaxies

1951
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
star formation rate can still work

1952
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.

1953
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
this is my conclusion

1954
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
the first part we said

1955
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
the nitrogen feedback type solution

1956
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
does not work

1957
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
it only has a very small impact

1958
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
the reason for the stator feedback

1959
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
is that it only changes

1960
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
the temperature

1961
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
the main reason is that

1962
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
the total energy input

1963
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
is much smaller than the cooling rate

1964
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
the magnetic field cosmic ground supernova

1965
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
is also the same

1966
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
the energy is not enough

1967
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
the conduction

1968
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
the big reason

1969
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
is that it is suppressed

1970
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
by the magnetic field line

1971
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
because the direction of the temperature

1972
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and the direction of the stator

1973
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
is different

1974
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
let me show you

1975
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
so

1976
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
the thermal conduction

1977
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
will be projected to the direction of the stator

1978
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
so it is suppressed

1979
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
we also said

1980
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
the morphology of star formation

1981
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
basically

1982
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
the impact of star formation

1983
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
does not affect the cooling rate

1984
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
we also talked about

1985
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
the AGM feedback

1986
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
we tried four different toy models

1987
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
one is

1988
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
momentum

1989
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
one is thermal conduction

1990
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
one is stator

1991
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
one is cosmic ray

1992
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
only add momentum

1993
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
in the direction of R

1994
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
basically

1995
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
if the energy is not enough

1996
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
you did not do anything

1997
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
if the energy is enough

1998
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
you did not do anything

1999
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
it is not the same as the observation

2000
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
if you

2001
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
increase the temperature of the gas

2002
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
it may work

2003
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
it may reduce the star formation rate

2004
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and the cooling flow

2005
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
but you have to fine tune

2006
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
you have to

2007
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
let the heat

2008
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
locally fit

2009
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
the cooling speed of the gas

2010
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
otherwise

2011
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
it will overheat

2012
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
thermal heating

2013
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
is not efficient

2014
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
if you add more energy

2015
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
the cooling speed

2016
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
will be faster

2017
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
so it is not efficient

2018
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
next is turbulent stirring

2019
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
if you stir the gas

2020
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
you can suppress the star formation rate

2021
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
effectively

2022
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
because you can

2023
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
mix the gas

2024
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
on the other hand

2025
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
you can reduce the density

2026
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
these are the two reasons

2027
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
if you

2028
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
control the stirring

2029
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
within 100 kpc

2030
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
you will not throw a lot of gas

2031
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
into the galaxy

2032
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
and suppress the

2033
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
extra luminosity

2034
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
next is cosmic ray

2035
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
this can also work

2036
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
because of the pressure support

2037
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
suppress the density

2038
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
basically

2039
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I did not talk about rejuvenation

2040
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
basically

2041
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
the result is

2042
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
turbulent stirring and cosmic ray

2043
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
are very important

2044
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
to solve the cooling flow problem

2045
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
and control the galaxy

2046
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
thank you
