00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm your host, Emma Lin.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm currently working on CO2 reduction in Caltech.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to our talk today.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
First, I'd like to introduce our speaker for today, Du Yixiu.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Du Yixiu is a doctoral student at Stanford University.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Physics.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
During her time at the university,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
she worked as a postdoctoral student at the Zhu Shiwei Laboratory.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
She did research on silicon photonics.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
During her time at the university,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
she went to Berkeley Department of Physics for a year.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
At the time, she did research on graphene synthesis.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yixiu is currently in the Department of Physics at Stanford.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
She did her Ph.D. in physics for a year.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
She is currently doing her Ph.D. rotation in Professor Gao Sunhong's lab.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The lab she is currently working on is

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
sound imaging and neuroscience-related research.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Her next interest in the doctoral program

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is to combine nanophotonics and neuroscience

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
to do applications.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The topic of her presentation today is

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the research she did with Professor Zhu Shiwei at the university.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The topic of this presentation is

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
about the rapid development of silicon memory circuits.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
People have always wanted to combine silicon

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and nanoparticles in a chip

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to achieve a real photonical IC.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
However, silicon components are relatively large,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
so they want to understand

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
whether they can reduce the magnitude to nanometers

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to achieve greater density

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
while maintaining the nature of nonlinear light.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The topic of this presentation is

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the great enhanced photothermal nonlinearity

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in a silicon nanoresonator.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's give a round of applause

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
to welcome our speaker today, Du Yixiu.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you for having me.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm Du Yixiu.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so if you have any questions,

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
please feel free to ask.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm Du Yixiu.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
so if you have any questions,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
please feel free to ask.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm Du Yixiu.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so if you have any questions,

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
please feel free to ask.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm Du Yixiu.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm Du Yixiu.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
so if you have any questions,

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
please feel free to ask.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm Du Yixiu.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
so if you have any questions,

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
please feel free to ask.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm Du Yixiu.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nowadays,

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
there are some people writing their article

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in 2010 called

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
''The Logical Next Step of an Optical Transistor''.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now this person publishes his article in 2010 called

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
''The Logical Next Step of an Optical Transistor''.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The article talks about

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
two important points

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
for nano photonics devices.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We want great density

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to match the electrical IC.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We also want a good enough functionality.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This functionality is like

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
an electrolyte.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We want a good enough electron-electron interaction.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Through this electron-electron interaction,

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
we can control the device.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Can optical do the same?

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's take a look.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Recently, there is a very popular field

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
called Silicon Photonics.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can see the timeline.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In 2003,

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it was Silicon Nanophotonics' birthday.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That day, everyone thought about

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
how to combine

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
nanoscale silicon waveguide

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and micronscale optical fiber

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
through a technique called

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
tapping.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then we can extend

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the optical fiber technology

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
to silicon waveguide technology.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to emphasize that

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
in the past 10 years,

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Silicon Photonics' field

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
has developed rapidly.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Looking back to modern science,

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
it is hard to see such a rapid development

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in 10 years.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Silicon Photonics is

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
a very popular field.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Next,

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I want to talk about

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
why everyone wants to

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
use silicon

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to realize electronics.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
First,

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
we know that there is a lot of silicon in nature,

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
so it is very natural abundance.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
On the other hand,

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
silicon has very mature fabrication technology,

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
so we can make very small devices,

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
but we can also make a lot of devices.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For various reasons,

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
electronics has developed rapidly,

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
so people want to

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
expand it to the photonics platform.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The reason is that

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
if we expand to the photonics platform,

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
we may have

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
very high speed potential.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We can potentially reach

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
a very high speed switch.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to show you

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the technology that combines

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
photonics and electronics.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Everything in the same platform.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is an article published in Nature

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
in 2018.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The left half of the article

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is the electronics device, transistor.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
On the same chip,

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
we can see the photonics device.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If we take a closer look,

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
we can see that

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the electronics device

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and the photonics device

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
are all on the same chip.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you look closely at this scale bar,

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
there are countless electrical devices

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
on the same chip.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We can make very good

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
electrical-based integrated circuits.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But in the case of the photonics device,

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
we only have one.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Its scale bar is 10 microns,

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
like this microresonator.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You may ask,

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
why don't we make it smaller?

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why do we have so many electronic devices?

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The reason is that

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
we want to reduce the footprint

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
from 10 microns to 100 nanometers.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's what people think.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But if we want to reduce the footprint,

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we have to consider other problems.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For example,

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
if we reduce the footprint,

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
we will have the same functionality

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
as a large size.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
One aspect of the functionality

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is optical nonlinearity.

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The optical nonlinearity of silicon

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
is very small.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The definition of nonlinearity is

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
if I increase the intensity of my illumination,

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
my refractive index

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
will also increase.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This coefficient represents

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the nature of the nonlinearity of the material itself.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Because our silicon

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
is a very small nonlinearity,

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
can we increase its intensity?

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, people think like Lipson.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In Columbia,

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Lipson thought about

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
whether to use a resonance structure

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to make the resonance bigger.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
For example,

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the structure of the microresonator,

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the SEM2,

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
can reach a very sharp spectrum

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and symbolize a very high quality factor.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
With such a resonance structure,

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
we can increase the functionality of our devices.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
However,

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
we want to make a very small device.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is there a way

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to make such a small device?

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Although the quality factor is very low,

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
can we use other ways

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
to reduce the quality factor?

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Can we find other nonlinearity mechanisms

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to make our functionality

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
maintain the same?

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is the most classic example

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
of a resonator in a microresonator.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The so-called mixed resonator

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
provides a resonance

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
at a very small magnitude.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If we look at this SEM2,

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
it has different resonance

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
colors,

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
such as blue,

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
green, and red.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This microresonator is size-dependent.

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There is a lot of research

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
on this matter,

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
especially in the past 10 years.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The so-called high-index material

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
has a very special resonance phenomenon.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It was published in 2017.

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It is Yusuke Nagasaki,

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
my collaborator.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He did the research.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It is a silicon-on-top-of-quartz structure.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This structure can fine-tune

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the width of each silicon nanoparticle,

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
such as Wx and Wy.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
With different combinations of widths,

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
we can get a rainbow-like structure.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This rainbow-like structure

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
tells us that

226
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
we have a very good ability

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
to fine-tune the resonance.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Our future research

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
will use a similar sample.

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The next thing I want to talk about

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is that since our nanostructure

232
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
has such a weak resonance,

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
is there any way

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
to increase it with other mechanisms?

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We all know that

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
photothermal is a solution.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Is there any other mechanism

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
to maintain its nonlinearity?

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The answer is that

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
we can combine photothermal

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and nonlinear resonance.

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
As you know,

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the photothermal effect

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
is a very large nonlinear effect.

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
In a small-scale nanoparticle,

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it is a very efficient optical heater.

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In this paper in 2017,

248
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
he sprinkled silicon

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
on the surface of SiO2

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
to show that

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in a specific dimension,

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the silicon nanoparticle

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
has a very strong optical heating effect.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We can heat this silicon nanoparticle

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to about 600K.

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Because of these two reasons,

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it is a very efficient optical heater.

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So maybe we can

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
use it to combine

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
nano-resonance to achieve

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
a greater nonlinear effect.

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So our work combines two things.

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The first thing is a very weak

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
nano-resonance,

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
but it is a very small nanostructure.

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The other part is

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
the photothermal effect.

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The photothermal effect provides

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
a very large nonlinear effect.

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If we combine these two things,

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
we can get a greater nonlinear effect.

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If we compare

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
these two things,

274
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
we can get a very small nanostructure

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and a very good photothermal effect.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If we compare

277
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
the photothermal effect,

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
we can see that

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
in ordinary materials,

280
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the nonlinear coefficient is about

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
10 to the power of 9.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
After the enhanced nonlinearity

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
of the photosynthesis,

284
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
we can increase the nonlinear coefficient

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
by 3 orders.

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is the process we are going to discuss.

287
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is our system.

288
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We want to achieve

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
resonance.

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We need to characterize

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the resonance.

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So we use a dark field system.

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This dark field system

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
allows us to get a spectrum

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This is a confocal system.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The light follows the orange light.

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It hits the object

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and passes through the gobbled mirror

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to select the particle you want.

300
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Finally, it enters the spectrum meter.

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
On the other hand,

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
we want to stimulate the photothermal effect.

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So we use a 5.6E laser.

304
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It passes through the gobbled mirror

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to control where we want to hit the particle.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It illuminates the silicon nanostructure.

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We also use a dark field system

308
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
to get a background-free,

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
clean image.

310
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is the resonance we get.

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We can see that by controlling

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
different nanostructures,

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
such as Wx and Wy,

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
we can get a very colorful image.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This colorful image tells us

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
that the resonance of each particle

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
is completely different.

318
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So we can expect

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
a different photothermal effect.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If we look at this line,

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
we can use a 5.6E laser

322
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
to do photothermal illumination.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Under this illumination,

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
we can see that

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
there are three peaks

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
of scattering intensity

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
at three different degrees.

328
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This result is quite similar

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
to the simulation.

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So we can say that

331
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
in the silicon nanostructure

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
at 100 nm,

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
there is a magnetic dipole,

334
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
an electric dipole,

335
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and a magnetic quadrupole.

336
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why do we choose a 5.6E wavelength?

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because with a 5.6E wavelength,

338
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
we can see different resonance peaks

339
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
at the same time.

340
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Different resonance peaks

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
affect the nonlinear behavior.

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
With the same 5.6E wavelength,

343
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
we can trigger

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
two different absorption peaks.

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is why we choose a 5.6E wavelength.

346
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I have been talking about

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
nonlinear effects.

348
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
In fact, what we want to discuss

349
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
is that if we increase

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the excitation intensity,

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
what will happen to

352
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the optical properties?

353
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If it is a linear case,

354
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
if we increase the excitation intensity,

355
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the scattering intensity

356
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
will also grow linearly.

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
However, if it is a nonlinear case,

358
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the scattering intensity

359
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
will saturate.

360
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Since we want to control

361
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the intensity of the light,

362
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
we need to adjust the power.

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We can adjust it like this.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Or we can

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
make good use of

366
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
our scanning system.

367
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We can move the beam like this.

368
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
By moving it like this,

369
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
we can also

370
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
saturate the nanostructure

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
at different intensities.

372
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
In this case,

373
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
we can see that in a linear case,

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
there will be a linear scattering growth.

375
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
In a nonlinear case,

376
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
there is a hole in the middle of our image.

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It has a dominance shape.

378
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This dominance shape tells us that

379
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
at the center point,

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
where the intensity of the light is the highest,

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
we have a relatively small

382
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
scattering behavior.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is a very strange phenomenon.

384
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If we want to quantify this phenomenon,

385
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
this is the result of

386
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
one of the size 190 nm nanoparticles.

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
When we increase the excitation intensity,

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the scattering intensity will

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
have a saturation phenomenon.

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We will see the point spread function

391
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
of this dominance shape.

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Similarly,

393
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
for example,

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
we will also see

395
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
a saturation phenomenon.

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
In 170 nm nanoparticles,

397
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
we can't find particles at low intensities.

398
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But when we increase the

399
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
excitation intensity,

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
the particles will suddenly come out.

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The scattering will suddenly increase a lot.

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
One thing to note is that

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
this phenomenon is reversible.

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We can restore it.

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It is not related to the damage

406
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
caused by the light.

407
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
To summarize,

408
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
different nanoparticles

409
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
have different scattering deviations.

410
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Scattering deviations like

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
100 nm nanoparticles

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
will have a decrease in intensity.

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
In 170 nm nanoparticles,

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the intensity will increase a lot.

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This phenomenon is not only

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
a nonlinear phenomenon

417
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
on this diagonal axis.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
In fact,

419
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
in different combinations of

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Wx and Wy,

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
we can observe

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
this very large nonlinear effect.

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why do I say it's very large?

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Because in the

425
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
nonlinear effect of

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
normal silicon itself,

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
we will only produce

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
about 10 to the power of 9 percent optical modulation.

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But in this case,

430
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
we will only produce

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
about 500 percent

432
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
or minus 70 percent

433
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
nonlinear modulation.

434
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
In addition,

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I want to talk about another thing.

436
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We just saw a summary.

437
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The nonlinear behavior of

438
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
different nanoparticles is different.

439
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What is the relationship between them?

440
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We can see that

441
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
in the negative nonlinearity,

442
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
like this saturation,

443
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the spectrum on the resonance

444
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
is a peak.

445
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
On the other hand,

446
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
this 170 nm nanoparticle

447
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
looks like a dip on the resonance spectrum.

448
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But we won't catch all the peaks.

449
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
For example,

450
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
this 130 nm nanoparticle

451
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
is a scattering peak,

452
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
but we can't observe the nonlinear behavior.

453
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why is that?

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We will explain further

455
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
with the photo thermal effect we just mentioned.

456
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
First of all,

457
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
the photo thermal effect

458
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
does exist in our system.

459
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
We have experimental evidence

460
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and simulated evidence.

461
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
In the experimental evidence,

462
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
we can use the Raman microscope

463
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
to observe how many degrees

464
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
the silicon nanoparticle has risen.

465
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Our answer is about a few hundred degrees.

466
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
This is quite consistent with the literature.

467
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
In the simulation,

468
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
we can see that

469
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
the silicon nanostructure

470
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
only has a very strong temperature increase

471
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
in a specific geometry.

472
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
This is the photo thermal effect we observed.

473
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If we heat up a silicon nanoparticle,

474
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
the photo thermal effect

475
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
produces heat.

476
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This heat

477
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
increases the refractive index.

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This increase in the refractive index

479
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
leads to the change in the mean resonance.

480
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This increase in the refractive index

481
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
leads to the change in the mean resonance.

482
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This leads to the nonlinear effect we mentioned.

483
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We simulated

484
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
this blue curve.

485
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Our scattering

486
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is the blue curve

487
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
for different size distributions.

488
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
When we increase the radius,

489
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we get the red curve.

490
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Because different particles

491
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
have different refractive indexes,

492
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the cross-section of the scattering is different.

493
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
If we combine these two lines,

494
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
we get the black curve.

495
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This black curve

496
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
is very consistent with the experiment.

497
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
This black curve is very consistent with the experiment.

498
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This black curve is very consistent with the experiment.

499
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This explains the effect of our observation

500
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
of the photo thermal effect.

501
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
In addition,

502
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In addition,

503
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
we simulated these three

504
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
170 and 190 neoparticles

505
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
as a single nonlinear curve.

506
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
as a single nonlinear curve.

507
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
This is very consistent with the experiment.

508
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This further proves that

509
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
the photo thermal effect

510
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is the nonlinearity mechanism.

511
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
is the nonlinearity mechanism.

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If you hear the word photo thermal effect,

513
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
many people may think

514
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
that if the device is controlled by thermal energy,

515
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
it may be very slow.

516
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But in fact,

517
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the photo thermal effect is not necessarily slow.

518
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
In terms of magnitude, it is very slow.

519
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But in terms of magnitude,

520
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
our experiment and simulation

521
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
have shown that

522
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
the photo thermal effect observed

523
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
on the silicon nanostructure

524
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
is very fast.

525
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
At this point,

526
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
if we turn on the 785nm laser,

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
there will be a large drop in the velocity.

528
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
there will be a large drop in the velocity.

529
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
This time scale is about 2ns.

530
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This simulation also tells us the same thing.

531
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This simulation also tells us the same thing.

532
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
If we look at this picture,

533
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
we can get a very fast thermal response

534
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
of 1GHz.

535
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
of 1GHz.

536
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It tells us that it is a minus 50% nonlinear effect.

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It tells us that it is a minus 50% nonlinear effect.

538
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So we can make a device

539
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
with a 50% deviation.

540
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
with a 50% deviation.

541
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But it still maintains a very fast speed of 1GHz.

542
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But it still maintains a very fast speed of 1GHz.

543
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Another interesting observation is

544
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
that when we

545
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
When we

546
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
When we

547
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
can we go back to the screen?

548
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Can we go back to the screen?

549
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What is the input image?

550
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What is the input image?

551
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What is the input image?

552
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What is the input image?

553
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The x-axis of the laser...

554
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The insert...

555
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The insert...

556
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The insert...

557
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You choose a peak and not a z-axis,

558
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You choose a peak and not a z-axis,

559
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
because the laser...

560
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
you can choose any size to reach the peak

561
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Our sample is placed at room temperature

562
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
but the Photo Thermal Effect is a local thermal effect

563
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,280
So the sensitization of the very small thickness

564
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,280
but the surrounding area is maintained

565
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Thank you for the question

566
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Another interesting phenomenon is

567
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,280
if it is a Photo Thermal Effect

568
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:39,280
then we change the surrounding thermal diffusion

569
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:46,280
For example, if the thermal diffusion is changed

570
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,280
then we should see a different phenomenon

571
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,280
The result is that our Point Spreading Function

572
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,280
has a very sharp transition

573
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,280
This is our profile

574
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,280
When we enter high laser intensity

575
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,280
we will have a very strange triangular change

576
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,280
This triangular change tells us a very shaky phenomenon

577
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,280
But we don't know how to explain it yet

578
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Let me make a conclusion

579
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,280
We observed a very large Photo Thermal Nonlinearity

580
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,280
We combined two things to achieve this result

581
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,280
The first thing is that we want to reduce the size

582
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,280
So we will use the material of Mean Resonance

583
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,280
We use the material of nanometer

584
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Usually we think of Mean Resonance

585
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Although the quality factor is very low

586
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,280
but we have other ways to solve this problem

587
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,280
So we meet the size requirement

588
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,280
How to meet the functionality requirement?

589
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,280
We use a very powerful natural

590
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:14,280
change of Photo Thermal Nonlinearity

591
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Combining these two things

592
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,280
we can create a Photo Thermal Effect

593
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,280
larger than the original Bulk

594
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Because of the Enhanced Mean Resonance

595
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,280
So we can get a very large Nonlinearity Effect

596
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Like this picture

597
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,280
When we increase Excitation Intensity

598
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Scattering Intensity saturates

599
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,280
and even creates a donut shape

600
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Another thing is that

601
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
this Photo Thermal Effect

602
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,280
is not necessarily as slow as the large scale

603
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,280
In fact, in a small scale

604
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:06,280
we have proven the recovery speed of a nanosecond

605
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,280
This allows us to make a 1GHz

606
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,280
about 50% deviation device

607
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,280
So I want to thank you for listening

608
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,280
and thank you to my advisor

609
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
at Taiwan University of Physics

610
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,280
And I want to thank my co-authors

611
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
like Yusuke Nagasaki

612
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,280
He is at Osaka University

613
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,280
I was lucky enough to go to Osaka University

614
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
for a while

615
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
and got to know them

616
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
They gave me great help

617
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Finally, they helped us with

618
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,280
fabrication

619
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
So thank you for listening

620
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,280
I am happy to take any questions

621
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
Thank you

622
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Thank you Yusuke

623
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,280
Any questions?

624
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,280
The first question is

625
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,280
I want to know how fabrication is done

626
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Where does silicon-on-quartz come from?

627
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,280
We bought the silicon-on-quartz structure from Company

628
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,280
How does it work?

629
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,280
It uses pure silicon

630
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,280
to oxidize the bottom layer into SiO2

631
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,280
The top layer is cut off with ion beam

632
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Wait, you said you bought the SOI structure?

633
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Yes

634
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Usually the SOI structure is made of silicon

635
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
The silicon is thicker

636
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,280
But the SOI structure is different

637
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,280
It's made of quartz

638
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
It's made of two layers

639
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
So it's wafer-bonding?

640
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Yes

641
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Another question is

642
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I want to know how the donor shape is formed

643
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:28,280
If we move the excitation beam from left to right

644
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Because the excitation beam is a Gaussian shape

645
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,280
When we pass through the nanostructure

646
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,280
The excitation of the nanostructure

647
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,280
is from the small innumeration to the big innumeration

648
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,280
When the big innumeration occurs

649
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,280
The Gaussian beam hits the nanostructure

650
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,280
So when we do confocal scanning

651
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,280
We are also varying the power density

652
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,280
So the image you show is not the real image

653
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,280
It's a scanning image

654
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,280
The raw data we get is like this

655
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,280
So the image is scanned?

656
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Yes

657
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,280
It's processed at the end

658
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,280
The last question is

659
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,280
This kind of mini-resonator

660
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
It has a large load

661
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,280
And it's not easy to couple

662
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,280
My understanding is that it's hard to couple to nanofortanites

663
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Is there any way to solve this problem?

664
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
This is a great question

665
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,280
For coupling

666
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Because the mainstream of nanofortanites

667
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Is to use the silicon waveguide

668
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,280
So it's hard to couple to the silicon waveguide

669
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
That's right

670
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,280
But we don't necessarily

671
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,280
It can be made like a gate

672
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Like this

673
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,280
This is a potential application

674
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
We have a silicon waveguide

675
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,280
We put a mini-resonator on it

676
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,280
If the intensity of my silicon waveguide is very strong

677
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Or we put a high beam on the right

678
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,280
To heat the silicon nanofortanite

679
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
We use another kind of wavelength

680
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
To communicate

681
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Although the load of the mini-resonator is large

682
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,280
But its load will not affect the communication wavelength

683
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Why not?

684
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Because it's a bit like a pump probe

685
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,280
We use an irrelevant wavelength to pump it

686
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Its purpose is to increase the temperature

687
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Of course, the on-off ratio can be done very well

688
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,280
But your signal will always have a loss

689
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,280
No matter if you have a gate

690
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,280
The loss of your waveguide will always be large

691
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
It should be like this

692
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Yes, because it's more of a scatter

693
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,280
But I think we can use engineering

694
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,280
To make the loss smaller through different wavelengths

695
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Like this picture

696
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,280
If we look at the absorption on the right

697
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
It's about 800 nm or more

698
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,280
The silicon itself has no absorption

699
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,280
So through different wavelengths

700
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,280
With different geometry of the mini-resonator

701
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,280
We can adjust the absorption

702
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,280
To make the loss as small as possible

703
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Is the main current of silicon waveguide 1.5μm?

704
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Why do you want to do it in the visible range?

705
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Because in the visible range

706
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,280
We have enough absorption

707
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,280
If it's 1.5μm, we don't have enough absorption

708
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Does this become a point to pay attention to in the future?

709
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Because most waveguides should be at 1.5μm or 1.1μm

710
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Yes, so the communication we want to send

711
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Should still be in the range of 1.5μm

712
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
But what we emphasize here is

713
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Our nanometer structure can produce enough heat

714
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,280
This heat can be enough to change the refractive index

715
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,280
You mean you still have to use visible to pump

716
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Then you use 1.5 to probe

717
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,280
This is the application in my mind

718
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,280
So the potential structure we saw just now

719
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,280
It hasn't been done yet

720
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,280
It hasn't been done yet

721
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Will ThermoLight affect your 1.5?

722
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Will the evidence of this not being tested be affected?

723
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
No, this will be the next project

724
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Hello

725
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Will the refractive index be affected by visible light?

726
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,280
If you choose, like you just said, there are about 5 or 6 waves

727
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
If you choose differently, maybe

728
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,280
I think it's about the same

729
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
I didn't hear it clearly

730
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,280
No, because the picture you just showed

731
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
There are about 4 or 5 peaks

732
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,280
I just asked you why you used the 750-pixel picture

733
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
Oh, yeah

734
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
But the other lasers

735
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,280
The other wavelength lasers feel more difficult to obtain

736
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
A little bit, yeah

737
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Yeah

738
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,280
It's okay, 400

739
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,280
A little more than 400, so there's a chance

740
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,280
This is done in the collaborator lab

741
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Their equipment is only 785

742
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,280
But I think in terms of quantity

743
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,280
I don't think Timescale will guess a lot

744
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Hello

745
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Any other questions?

746
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
I have a general question

747
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Because I'm not involved in this field

748
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
I want to ask

749
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,280
Basically in this field

750
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,280
The current level of development is

751
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,280
You just said you want to scale

752
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,280
When you want to scale smaller and smaller

753
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,280
You want to maintain the quality of the laser beam

754
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,280
And reduce other costs

755
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
In this field

756
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,280
Are there already a lot of people doing it?

757
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Or are you the pioneers?

758
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,280
And besides this direction

759
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,280
What other directions do you think

760
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Have the potential to improve this problem?

761
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
I think

762
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,280
The interaction between light and light itself is very small

763
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,280
So generally everyone will try to

764
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,280
Make the resonance structure bigger

765
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,280
Solve this problem through geometric methods

766
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,280
The most famous example is

767
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,280
Microlipson's microbeam resonator

768
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,280
The structure shown in the beginning

769
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,280
So I believe

770
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
Photonic's mainstream is something like this

771
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,280
But everyone is still trying

772
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,280
So they haven't thought about how to make the device smaller

773
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Are they just proposing ideas

774
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,280
Or have they already made some prototypes?

775
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Photonic has already made something

776
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Many companies are already selling this kind of device

777
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,280
So what are they doing with the microbeam?

778
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,280
Waveguide

779
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,280
Waveguide control

780
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,280
How do they use the microbeam to control?

781
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Usually

782
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,280
If

783
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,280
If I have a beam

784
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,280
If I have an EM wave

785
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,280
Passed through the waveguide

786
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,280
If the frequency of my EM wave

787
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,280
Just meets the resonance structure of the nanostructure

788
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,280
Then it will be completely trapped in this structure

789
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
Will not continue to propagate

790
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,280
So it can play the role of off

791
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,280
The biggest discovery of Microlipson

792
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,280
Is that he put a

793
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Put a potential

794
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,280
Electrical potential

795
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Put a gating

796
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,280
This gating will cause the refractive index to change

797
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,280
So it can choose which light to pass and which light not to pass

798
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,280
I have seen a similar structure before

799
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,280
But it seems to be like

800
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,280
You just

801
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,280
The light is from top to bottom

802
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
But it seems to be

803
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,280
A very similar structure

804
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
It can go from top left to bottom right

805
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
But it can't go from bottom right to top left

806
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,280
But

807
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,280
But I think this thing

808
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,280
I didn't understand at that time

809
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,280
I just looked at its abstract

810
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,280
It can do this

811
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,280
But I wanted to ask you

812
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,280
Do you know how he did it?

813
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,280
I don't know

814
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
You can find the abstract

815
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,280
I don't seem to be

816
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Glenn Davison

817
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,280
A professor at Maryland

818
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
They are also doing Microlipson

819
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,280
So what you said is that it can only pass in one direction

820
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,280
It can't pass in another direction

821
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,280
Although it uses a pathway

822
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,280
Yes

823
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,280
So I thought it was amazing at that time

824
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,280
But I didn't take a closer look at it

825
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,280
Have to find it again

826
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,280
So what is the biggest advantage of its circular disk type?

827
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,280
Compared to your general straight line web guide

828
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,280
Because it will have a resonance structure

829
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,280
It will have a resonance structure

830
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Called Whisper Gallery

831
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
So the energy is stronger

832
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,280
The signal is stronger

833
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,280
I remember you have a picture

834
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,280
It will have about four

835
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,280
Two peaks

836
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,280
I remember in the front or the back

837
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,280
This one

838
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,280
Yes

839
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Their separation

840
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,280
It probably has something to do with the radius of this ring

841
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,280
Or the size

842
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,280
Or the voltage

843
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Of course

844
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,280
So how much is the Q of this one?

845
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,280
This Q is probably 10

846
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,280
5-quart scale

847
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,280
5-quart scale is pretty good

848
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,280
Microcality is also about 6-7 quarts

849
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,280
But in Mi Resonance

850
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,280
The quality factor is probably only 1000

851
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,280
So there is a difference of 3 quarts

852
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,280
So I can only use other mechanisms

853
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,280
To achieve the same energy

854
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
Sorry

855
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,280
Mi Resonator has 1000?

856
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,280
Sorry

857
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,280
About 10-100

858
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,280
Ok

859
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,280
So the picture you just showed

860
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,280
Is about 10-100

861
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
Yes

862
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
Scale

863
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
Ok

864
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,280
Thank you everyone for your passionate questions

865
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,280
Anyone else has questions?

866
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,280
No

867
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,280

Click on the chat on the right

876
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
Can I type?

877
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,280
You can

878
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,280
Can you hear me?

879
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,280
Yes

880
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,280
I want to ask

881
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,280
Thank you for your talk

882
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,280
I want to ask

883
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,280
You mentioned that

884
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,280
It has a nonlinear effect

885
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,280
So it changed the N2 part

886
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,280
The current nonlinear effect

887
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,280
Is what I want to compare

888
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,280
Yes

889
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,280
If you have a strong current nonlinear effect

890
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,280
You should also have a strong 2-photon absorption

891
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,280
In this device

892
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,280
I want to say

893
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,280
The question is

894
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,280
If you have a strong 2-photon absorption

895
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,280
You can directly use the 1.5 wavelength

896
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,280
Or use a more transparent wavelength

897
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,280
To achieve a strong nonlinear effect

898
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
Nonlinear effect

899
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,280
I don't know if you've tried it

900
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
Some people do it like this

901
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,280
But

902
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,280
To trigger the 2-photon absorption

903
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,280
We need a very strong intensity

904
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
So they use a femtosecond laser

905
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,280
I see

906
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
So you guys

907
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
I see

908
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
So you guys

909
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
Don't have a femtosecond laser

910
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Not that I don't have a problem

911
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,280
We want to use the minimum intensity

912
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,280
Minimum intensity

913
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,280
To trigger the nonlinearity

914
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
I see

915
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,280
I can ask

916
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
I'm not sure if you compare like this

917
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,280
But I want to

918
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,280
Understand a little bit more

919
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,280
If you put your excitation

920
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,280
These power density

921
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Then you normalize it

922
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
Absorption cross action

923
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280
You probably

924
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
How many photons do you need

925
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,280
To start seeing these nonlinear effects

926
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,280
Can you say it again

927
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,280
Because your excitation

928
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,280
Most of the light

929
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,280
Doesn't really couple to

930
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,280
Its resonant mode

931
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,280
Because its gathering cross action is very small

932
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,280
But if you put your

933
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,280
Excitation power density

934
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,280
To normalize its

935
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
Absorption cross action

936
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,280
Which means that you

937
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
Really excite the structure of the photon

938
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
How many photons do you need

939
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,280
To be able to see

940
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,280
Its nonlinear phenomenon

941
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,280
Or

942
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,280
Because you emphasize that it is very strong

943
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,280
You may be able to see very small power

944
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,280
Just

945
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,280
See this nonlinear effect

946
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,280
Do you have some

947
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,280
More quantitative

948
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,280
Comparison method

949
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,280
How much power

950
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,280
Or how many photons

951
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,280
Do you need

952
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,280
How much intensity

953
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,280
If it is

954
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,280
If it is

955
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,280
5

956
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Megawatts per

957
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,280
square meter

958
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,280
Right

959
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,280
General nonlinearity is

960
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,280
10 to the power of 9

961
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,280
I see

962
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,280
In our case

963
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,280
There will be a very large deviation

964
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
I see

965
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,280
So if you

966
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,280
10 to the power of 9

967
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,280
If there is such a phenomenon

968
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,280
Then I almost have to

969
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,280
5 times 10 to the power of 9

970
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,280
To be able to use

971
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,280
Absorption of two photons

972
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,280
To achieve a similar effect

973
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,280
I see

974
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,280
I see OK

975
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Then I can probably

976
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,280
Thank you for your answer

977
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Thank you

978
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,280
Thank you

979
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,280
OK

980
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,280
Thank you all for your questions

981
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Then I will stop

982
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,280
That's all for today's speech

983
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,280
I will stop recording
