1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's Project Terra talk.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm the host today. Just call me Ted.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today's speaker is Don Yen-Yong from Caltech.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He works at NASA JPL in Caltech.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Today's topic is Connected Inductance Detector for Next-Generation Dark Matter Search.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, Yen-Yong, it's your turn.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hi, everyone.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Today's talk is more like an update on the latest situation.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think I've talked about what I've done a year ago.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually, the content is pretty much the same, but there's a new progress.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Some parts of the talk might be fast, and some parts might not be clear.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
To be honest, I've been very busy lately, so I've only started this morning.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So if you don't ask questions, it'll be over soon.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Today's topic is connected...

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let me add that when you come in, you don't have a microphone on.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So if you want to ask a question, you have to turn on the microphone.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So you can ask the question and hear it.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
At the same time, you can also ask the question in the chat next to you.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, sorry. Yen-Yong, let's get started.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay, I have another question.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Can you see my mouse?

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can you see it?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can see it, right?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Because I might talk about this and that a lot, so I need a mouse.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, so today's topic is Kinetic Inductance Detector for Next Generation Dark Matter Search.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So as you can see, there are two parts to the topic.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
One part is that we're thinking about looking for dark matter.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
At this stage, we're going to look at future development.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The other part of this talk is that we think we can apply this.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We call it KIT, K-I-T, Kinetic Inductance Detector.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As the next main, we think it's going to be very competitive.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This technology to do this.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, and then this work is mainly from where I am.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Caltech and NASA JPL, which is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Of course, this whole work is actually based on a bigger project called Super CDMS.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll talk about it later.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I want to emphasize that KIT is not a CDMS project yet.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it's more like our own R&D.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But we're doing it in a big collaboration.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, so now you see this first page.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The first page is our current prototype.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That gives you a sense of the size.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This circle is 3 inches.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Its diameter is 3 inches.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's about the same size as a palm.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So now you see this little rectangle.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's about a half to one millimeter in size.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then there are 80 little islands on it.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll explain what it is.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, and then this box.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's basically hanging on a dilution refrigerator.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So it can be lowered to the temperature of the mini Kelvin level.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I'll explain why we're doing this.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, first of all, today's outline is why.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because we don't have a particle physics background today.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And there seems to be a problem, right?

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So I'm going to explain a little bit today.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why do we think there's dark matter?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What the hell is dark matter?

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I'm going to use an association here.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's more important is that this is our focus.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why do we think this low-quality, low-mass dark matter is an important topic now?

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we want to do this.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, this is an opening.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And then I'll talk about the super CDMS detector called HVEV.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
HVE is high voltage.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
EV is the electron volt.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He's actually talking about what we're doing in a high voltage mode.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Under this operation, we can have EV resolution.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, so I'm going to start by saying that this is a CDMS project.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What did we learn from this?

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So what did we get?

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So where's our sensitivity?

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So from here, I'm going to motivate.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So why the third part, the kinetic inductance detector, this thing.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's going to be something that we think is very potential.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So now the CDMS proposal is written to 2025.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So we're actually talking about this thing.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Dark matter search beyond 2025.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What kind of outlook do we have?

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do we think?

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, let's get started.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then I welcome you to ask me any questions at any time.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Otherwise, this talk is really going to be pretty fast.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And my speech is actually very fast.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay, the first part, low-mass dark matter.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, first of all, I remember two or three weeks ago.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have a very good friend, He Shuyu.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He talked about a talk.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's actually doing the theory of dark matter.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So why is there dark matter?

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What the hell is dark matter?

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I just have this page today.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So if you're interested, you want to know more details.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can go see his talk.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He's a very good speaker.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He taught very well.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then I'll summarize here.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is some evidence that we think there is dark matter.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
First of all, you see this picture in the upper left corner.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The y-axis of this picture is the speed of the planet's rotation in the Milky Way.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What about this horizontal axis?

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's the distance between these planets and the center of the Milky Way.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, so now you see that there are dozens of lines here.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then more than 20 lines.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If we take a few steps.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
These lines, each line is a galaxy.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Then you can go to the galaxy.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There are a lot of planets in the galaxy.

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The speed of rotation to the center.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then the distance to the center.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You see a line like this.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's a galaxy, a galaxy, a galaxy.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
According to Newton's law that we learned in high school.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If today we assume that Newton's law is correct.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Or relative theory is correct.

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then we think he's right.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
OK, what about this line?

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What should it look like?

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It should look like this.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's from the top.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The closer to the center, the faster the rotation.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And then it goes down like this.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And then the closer it is to the outside, the slower it rotates.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
OK.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But in fact, what we see is not like this.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In fact, what we see is.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The speed of rotation of these planets.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's going to pull up from the center.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course, it's very close to the center.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We don't understand.

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because there are a lot of planets in the middle.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A lot of electrons and so on.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Then we get rid of the middle.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He saw that it was almost flat.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OK, almost flat.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That means.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course, we can say.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then this may be.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The theory of gravity is incorrect.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is possible.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But gravity has been experimented by a lot of experiments.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
From classical gravity to the theory of gravity.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The theory of gravity has been very, very accurately verified.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So then we can think about it in another way.

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is that?

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, we have quality.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It exists in that range.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But we didn't see it.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We can't see these qualities.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So we miscalculated.

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But if we add these qualities.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We can recover like this.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is the center of gravity.

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The speed of rotation of this curve.

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
OK, this is a hint.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That is to say, there may be some matter over there.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We can't see it.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We call it dark matter.

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But OK.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So you can imagine this dark matter.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Under this picture.

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Like a fluid or a gas.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a continuous.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And then it's distributed smoothly in that space.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In the middle of the galaxy.

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
OK.

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But we don't know its particle nature.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That is to say, we can understand.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
For example, air or water.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But we can't find that molecule.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That H2O.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
OK.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Now in this upper right corner.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What you see is a bigger scale.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This simulation.

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are in this simulation.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Every little light spot you see.

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's all a bunch of galaxies.

181
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's no longer one by one.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's a bunch of galaxies.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
OK.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Then this picture is actually white.

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So you can see the black part.

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What about this black part?

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That is, if we assume.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There is a gas in this universe.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not going to be with other gases.

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is the interaction.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But it has weight.

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So it's going to have a denser place.

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Because gravity attracts.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And then it's going to form.

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Like this spider web structure.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then these spider web structures are denser.

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Gravity is heavier.

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It will attract these gases.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
These we can see.

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
These normal.

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
These substances.

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Gather together.

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And then form a galaxy.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then we found out.

205
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We must be in our computer.

206
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
In this simulation.

207
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
With this kind of content.

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We can.

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Simulate this.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The evolution of the universe.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then we produce what we want.

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The density of this galaxy.

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So we think this is also a proof.

214
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That is, there is a kind of matter that will not interact.

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Dark matter.

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is Bully Cluster.

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I won't talk about this.

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Everyone can go.

219
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This can be googled.

220
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is a bit complicated.

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But basically, he said.

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If there are two galaxies colliding today.

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We can see the quality inside.

224
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Will hit and will not pass.

225
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The difference in quality.

226
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Then we found out that he had to have a part.

227
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Will not touch.

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Passed by.

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
OK, what about the last one?

230
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is a very, very accurate evidence.

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is what we see.

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The change in temperature in the whole sky.

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I call the background color of the universe.

234
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The change in temperature in the whole sky.

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then he changed this.

236
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And then we found out.

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If we assume that this change is from.

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
When the universe was very, very early.

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
These substances.

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This process of gathering together.

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The moment of that temperature.

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
OK.

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
These condensed substances.

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It must have a certain proportion.

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Will interact.

247
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A certain proportion will not collide with each other.

248
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That proportion can be very, very accurate.

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Fixed.

250
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is the case.

251
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
OK, so we know from here.

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, that.

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We can calculate very accurately.

254
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
In this universe.

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
20 to 30% will not interact.

256
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Of this substance.

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then about 5% will interact.

258
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What about the rest?

259
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is another energy content.

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Dark energy.

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But we won't talk about it today.

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So these are the evidence of dark matter.

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's a bit like a science.

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you have any questions?

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If you are interested in any of these.

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can talk a little bit.

267
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Otherwise, we'll go.

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What does this angle scale mean?

269
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why is the angle scale?

270
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, OK.

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So this picture is like this.

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You can of course.

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This thing.

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's the color next to it.

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The whole universe.

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Just put your temperature on it.

277
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Different temperatures have different colors.

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But you can do this today.

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
A map of the 2D map.

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But it's a universe.

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So his.

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's a bit like you're doing it.

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Frequency spectrum.

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But his frequency.

285
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That dimension is the angle.

286
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
OK, OK.

287
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Is it OK?

288
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He's doing it.

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It will look like this.

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
OK.

291
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But that.

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because I'm doing particle physics.

293
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So we care more about this thing.

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's what I just said.

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There's a group of gas in the universe.

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not going to work at all.

297
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So if we break it down.

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is the smallest.

299
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is the constituent.

300
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So what is it?

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Elementary particle?

302
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It can be one by one.

303
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Very, very heavy.

304
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But his number is very small.

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Or he can be one by one.

306
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Very light.

307
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But he's very, very many.

308
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So in the same volume.

309
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's produced in that cube.

310
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The quality inside is the same.

311
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's in line with what we just did.

312
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The observation of these big gases.

313
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I got the density of this quality.

314
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay, but he's in the particle nature.

315
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's going to be very different.

316
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Now, what you see here.

317
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OK, this is.

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is.

319
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This quality unit.

320
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So if you're in this background.

321
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You don't have to explain to me.

322
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What is EV?

323
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If you don't know this.

324
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What unit is this EV?

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll give you a sense.

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
From this K to M.

327
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Sorry.

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
From this K to M, this neighborhood.

329
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's the X-ray that you usually take.

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
OK.

331
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If you're in this.

332
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is not.

333
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is just the unit.

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
EV this range.

335
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's visible light.

336
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Energy and quality can be exchanged.

337
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So the strength of this energy.

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is visible light.

339
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is X-ray.

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And then this is very, very powerful.

341
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And then this is here.

342
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's very, very light.

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's like coming here.

344
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It might be the usual.

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The radio wave on the phone.

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then go further.

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's very, very light.

348
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Light to the particle.

349
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The length of the material wave can be long.

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This kind of astronomical scale.

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
OK.

352
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay, so this is.

353
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This mass.

354
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
OK, this dark matter candidate mass.

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And then what's below?

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's all kinds of us now.

357
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This theory.

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And then you can see that this is almost.

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can go to the sky and say whatever you want.

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's the heaviest you can get.

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is the unit of solar mass.

362
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He can't use this EV anymore.

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But if we cut this part out and look at it.

364
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
From here to the other end.

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's dozens of orders of magnitude.

366
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
OK.

367
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We don't know this thing at all.

368
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Basically, we don't know this thing at all.

369
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What is it?

370
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
OK.

371
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Good.

372
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So here's a lot of this model.

373
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That.

374
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Uh, now I'm going to draw this orange frame.

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
OK, this frame.

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Sorry.

377
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It can be said that in the past 30 or 40 years.

378
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All I want to know is the particle.

379
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The experiment of dark matter is focused on this frame.

380
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's a reason for this frame.

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The top line of this frame.

382
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
There's a theoretical top line called Unitary Bond.

383
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If this single particle of this dark matter.

384
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If it's heavier than this one up here.

385
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He will, uh, have this mathematical theoretical problem.

386
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That is to say, it will exceed Unitary.

387
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know why, but OK.

388
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So, in theory, we can say that he won't go beyond this.

389
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Unless he looks really weird.

390
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
For example, he is a black hole or something.

391
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This thing is going to be astronomical observation.

392
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's what we're not going to talk about on the single particle.

393
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
OK, what's next?

394
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You can see that this is a very clear picture here.

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What does it mean?

396
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's his interaction, or his own quality.

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or the energy he can carry.

398
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's probably in this weak interaction.

399
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The energy scale of this interaction.

400
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He has a very strong reason.

401
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll talk about it later.

402
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But you can see that the more important thing is.

403
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So all the design of the experiment.

404
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Including, uh, in the collision machine.

405
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Whether it's a Japanese collision machine, a European collision machine.

406
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
China may build a collision machine in the future.

407
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Everyone is basically aiming at this orange box.

408
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Find Dark Matter inside.

409
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What about all the experiments that don't do this collider?

410
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Basically, now the major experiments are also in this box.

411
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
OK, but you can see it right away.

412
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There are 30 orders of magnitude here.

413
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's only less than one-tenth.

414
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
OK, so why do they aim at this box?

415
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's talk about it first.

416
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What kind of technology is this limit?

417
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Or what kind of technology are they based on?

418
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They will focus on this box.

419
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
In fact, the concept of measuring Dark Matter is very simple.

420
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's like hitting a ball.

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
OK, this is the earth.

422
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Then this is us.

423
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then we took some of the materials that people can manipulate.

424
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
To do any of our experimental equipment.

425
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then these equipment are nothing more than a bunch of seeds and seeds.

426
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Here is a seed or seed.

427
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The earth is in the solar system.

428
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The solar system is in the galactic system.

429
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Then the galactic system is full of what I just said.

430
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The gas of Dark Matter is drifting in the entire galactic system.

431
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So when our solar system revolves around the center of the galactic system.

432
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We are constantly like being blown by the wind of Dark Matter.

433
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
OK, so at this time, if we take this seed and seed.

434
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
To build an experiment on the earth.

435
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Dark Matter will keep going through.

436
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We think it's very, very small.

437
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course, we haven't measured it yet.

438
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But it is likely to exist.

439
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It won't just go through.

440
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It will hit our experiment and then bounce away.

441
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
At this time, there will be some of this dynamic being picked up.

442
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
On this seed or seed.

443
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then we will measure this seed or seed.

444
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We can know how heavy it is.

445
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Hit down.

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It will pick up such a large amount of energy.

447
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We call it Recall Energy.

448
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
OK, let's bring all the numbers in.

449
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We probably know that.

450
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Dark Matter to choose.

451
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How fast we blow the wind of Dark Matter.

452
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
OK, so we know how heavy the seed or seed is.

453
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then we can be different.

454
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This hypothetical Dark Matter Mass.

455
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
To calculate how much energy we can pick up.

456
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We pick up this recall energy.

457
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The most efficient scenario is exactly the same as hitting the ball.

458
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If there is a very heavy thing today.

459
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Hit a very light thing.

460
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Or a very light thing.

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Hit a very heavy thing.

462
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The speed of the two people is almost unchanged.

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So this will not pick up energy.

464
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But the most efficient time.

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's the thing that comes across.

466
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
With the thing that is hit.

467
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The two of them are almost just right.

468
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So let's estimate that.

469
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
OK, if we assume now.

470
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hit Dark Matter.

471
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The quality of this particle.

472
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Exactly.

473
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's with us to do this experiment.

474
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The seed is just as heavy.

475
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What about the energy that he transferred?

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's probably an X-ray energy.

477
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So if we can build an experiment today.

478
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We can measure X-ray.

479
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This energy.

480
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We can probably measure this kind of Dark Matter.

481
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What's the problem here?

482
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is high school physics.

483
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay, no problem, I'll go on.

484
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Then you assume the weight of the dark matter.

485
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because all of your detectors are magnets.

486
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's similar.

487
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Isn't that like this?

488
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You have a predicted dark matter.

489
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's about the same weight as a magnet.

490
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay, this is a very good question.

491
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll talk about it later.

492
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You can imagine.

493
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So if Dark Matter today.

494
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's a super-heavy thing.

495
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Or a super-light thing.

496
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I say relatively compared to.

497
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
For example, Proton.

498
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's a super-heavy or super-light thing.

499
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It hits.

500
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Your experiment doesn't actually pick up any energy.

501
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Right?

502
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, or it's super light.

503
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, he's gone.

504
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, that's right.

505
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's what it is.

506
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So you can say.

507
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Use an order of magnitude estimate.

508
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just say OK.

509
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So you use this kind of target particle.

510
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Basically.

511
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You set yourself up first.

512
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's probably in this order of magnitude.

513
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
To measure the weight of this particle.

514
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If it's heavy or light, you won't be able to measure it.

515
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because the energy transfer will become small.

516
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Right?

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
All right, yeah, all right.

519
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay, let's go back to the other side.

520
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, in general, if you go to a dark matter meeting.

521
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is what people usually see.

522
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What is this picture?

523
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This picture is.

524
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is the imaginary.

525
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Dark Matter Mass.

526
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
From here is the 10 to the negative 5 times of the GV to the 10 to the 3 times of the GV.

527
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Uh, okay.

528
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay, so what about these 10 lines?

529
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's an already completed experiment.

530
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sorry.

531
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What about these long lines?

532
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's about to be released.

533
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Uh, the results of the experiment that will be released in a few years.

534
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Okay, what about those dots?

535
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's something like conceptual design.

536
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Or something like, uh.

537
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Calculate it out and say I project.

538
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If I have completed this concept, where can I go?

539
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's not so realistic.

540
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay, so I'm going to draw a line here.

541
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It means that I'm done with this experiment and I'm going to put it all back on top.

542
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Okay, what does that mean?

543
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It means.

544
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I open my experiment and then I keep waiting and waiting and waiting.

545
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I know how long I've been waiting.

546
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I know how heavy my experiment is.

547
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Therefore, I know how many protons or neutrons I have waiting there.

548
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Wait for a long time.

549
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't wait for anything.

550
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So I can say.

551
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
How big is it according to my experiment?

552
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
How long have I been waiting?

553
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And then I didn't see anything.

554
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can say with enough confidence.

555
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Dark matter passes through me.

556
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The probability of being blocked.

557
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's not going to be more than a number.

558
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Otherwise, I should see something.

559
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This sentence is a bit long.

560
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Can you understand?

561
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay, so based on.

562
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I didn't see any results of the experiment.

563
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But I know very clearly.

564
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
How long have I been waiting?

565
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How many things did I use to block?

566
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Can't block.

567
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So I can say.

568
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Dark matter and protons and neutrons.

569
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The probability of interaction will not exceed a number.

570
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then I can.

571
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
For each different assumption.

572
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The quality of dark matter.

573
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
To calculate a number.

574
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So in the end, it's a line.

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Then I'll empty it out here.

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Draw it black.

577
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That is to say.

578
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay, dark matter.

579
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The interaction.

580
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If today is.

581
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If it's EEV.

582
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's definitely not.

583
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The interaction is 10 to 40.

584
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Must be smaller.

585
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
If it's bigger.

586
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I should see it.

587
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
OK.

588
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So these lines are what it means.

589
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So you can see.

590
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The current limit is.

591
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This way.

592
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That is to say.

593
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We have to keep going down.

594
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Keep digging down.

595
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Until one day we see.

596
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Dark matter really.

597
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Always in the detector.

598
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
it is good.

599
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Then.

600
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Go back to the question that Ted just asked.

601
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Now all the experiments here.

602
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
There is sensitivity.

603
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You can measure.

604
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can set a limit.

605
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Constraint like this.

606
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But it's probably around here.

607
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's all gone.

608
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And then there's almost no way to measure it any lower.

609
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why?

610
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Because all of these experiments.

611
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's all paper and seeds.

612
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
To block dark matter.

613
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So for these.

614
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Lighter possible dark matter.

615
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
When it hits.

616
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The remaining energy is very small.

617
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
In these experiments.

618
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It can't be measured.

619
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
OK, I can't measure it.

620
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Then I can't say.

621
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What should I do here?

622
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So there's a threshold here.

623
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Further down.

624
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We can't measure dark matter.

625
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is the first point.

626
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The second point.

627
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There's a yellow one down here.

628
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
A very large piece of stuff.

629
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What is this?

630
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This is a constant.

631
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The seeds of the earth.

632
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Now all the experimental design.

633
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Basically, there is no clear.

634
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The way is to say.

635
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can be very efficient.

636
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Distinguish between dark matter and seeds.

637
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The difference in this signal.

638
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So if I keep digging today.

639
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I keep going down.

640
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Keep drawing.

641
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's about this long.

642
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Here.

643
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If I keep drawing here.

644
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Dig it out.

645
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I still don't see the dark matter.

646
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Next, I'll go crazy.

647
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There's always a signal.

648
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But I probably will.

649
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
We all think.

650
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, that should be the sun.

651
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's coming out.

652
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Or the radioactivity of the earth.

653
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Out of the seeds.

654
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We can't do it again.

655
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Continue to measure this part.

656
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
At least in the foreseeable future.

657
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No technology can do this.

658
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
OK.

659
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Why are these experiments still so focused?

660
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Dig this part.

661
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
For example, from 10GbE to 50EbE.

662
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's the reason.

663
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Now I'm going to draw these models.

664
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You can see it.

665
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's full of models here.

666
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's what I just said.

667
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It can even extend to 10 to 30.

668
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
No problem.

669
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But all of this.

670
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What you can dig here is MSSM.

671
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
This is called super symmetry theory.

672
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Between the 1980s and 2000s.

673
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Everyone is very confident about super symmetry theory.

674
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think it might be.

675
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's a very important theory.

676
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It also provides a variety of variations.

677
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It depends on what kind of super symmetry theory you are.

678
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The dark matter candidate.

679
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So everyone is confident.

680
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But keep digging.

681
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But in fact, the earliest version of super symmetry theory.

682
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
In fact, its prediction should be around 10 to 38.

683
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's already been dug up.

684
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And be ruled out by more than 10 orders of magnitude.

685
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So much.

686
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
OK, so now we see this P or C or N.

687
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What about this super symmetry theory?

688
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's all very fine-tuned.

689
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
OK, so now we generally think.

690
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
OK.

691
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Within 5 to 10 years.

692
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
These experiments will be completed.

693
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The dotted line they draw.

694
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Unless we are either in this range.

695
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We found the document.

696
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Otherwise, these experiments are based on technology.

697
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
There will probably be a lot of difficulty.

698
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Extend down.

699
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Because it will meet neutrino.

700
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
This is the first point.

701
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The second point is.

702
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
In fact, if you are.

703
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a theory that needs to be very natural.

704
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Not very artificially.

705
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
To find a very difficult to produce.

706
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The combination of parameters.

707
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
In fact, those natural.

708
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Theoretical prediction.

709
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's already been dug up.

710
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
OK.

711
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But back to this point.

712
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
In fact, there are still a lot of models down here.

713
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
OK.

714
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So we want to do.

715
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Uh.

716
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We want to find better technology.

717
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
In addition to digging here.

718
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We want to be able to cover the remaining dozens.

719
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
This order of magnitude is not measured at all.

720
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Or it's hard to measure.

721
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
OK.

722
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So what are we going to do?

723
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I just said.

724
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We want to block a very light particle.

725
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We can't use a very heavy magnet or seed to block it.

726
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because of this.

727
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This energy will be very little.

728
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So that's another thing that humans can control.

729
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
In addition to the magnet and the seed is the electron.

730
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
In fact, there is not much else.

731
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
OK.

732
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Then I change it to an electron now.

733
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
OK.

734
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then I bring the number in.

735
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The electron is instantly 100 times lighter than the magnet and the seed.

736
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
No, sorry.

737
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
1,000 times.

738
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
2,000 times.

739
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Almost 2,000 times.

740
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
To a very, very light quality.

741
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So now I can block it.

742
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The energy consumed is probably.

743
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I can be sensitive to 100EV.

744
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's dozens of EV.

745
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Let's talk about dozens of EV.

746
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But if you use a magnet.

747
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's hundreds of EVs that can be measured.

748
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That is to say, if I want to eat more.

749
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Eat this light particle more efficiently.

750
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Give me the energy.

751
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I have to use light things to block.

752
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So our idea now is.

753
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Electron as the target of being hit.

754
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
OK.

755
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Okay, because he's an electron.

756
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So he actually has another interaction.

757
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He will directly put the light.

758
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Light is the electromagnetic wave.

759
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So if there is a model today.

760
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Is.

761
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Will convert to light or light.

762
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
He will absorb it all.

763
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
At this time, it is not the opposite.

764
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And then eat some of the energy.

765
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But we will put all this energy.

766
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Just like his quality, so much energy.

767
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The quality will become his energy.

768
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Eat it all.

769
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Then we can also measure this.

770
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
If you use electrons.

771
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
OK.

772
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So we are now.

773
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I think we should use electrons.

774
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
To replace the straight and neutral.

775
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
To produce for lighter particles.

776
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This sensitivity.

777
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Then we will.

778
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's a definition of this talk.

779
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That is to say, we will talk about low mass later.

780
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Low mass is probably GEV.

781
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Or lighter particles.

782
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Then emphasize it again.

783
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There are so many here.

784
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
For example, dark sector.

785
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
This is the metric.

786
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Freezing, etc.

787
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
OK.

788
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Of course, there are.

789
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Uh.

790
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We are still experimenting with this.

791
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I just talked about this.

792
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The mechanism of hitting the ball.

793
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But in fact.

794
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
For example, like the theory.

795
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Uh, he predicted that.

796
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
There will be very natural.

797
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Can produce this.

798
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's not a particle at all.

799
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's more like a bunch of.

800
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's like this.

801
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We can actually measure it.

802
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But of course we have to assume that.

803
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Assuming he's going to do this.

804
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This kind of behavior.

805
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Then we can use this method to measure.

806
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So in other words, we can.

807
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If there is such a behavior.

808
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What is his probability?

809
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That's for me.

810
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Uh, like we do experiments.

811
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
A more important point is.

812
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
How do we really.

813
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
To do such an experiment realistically.

814
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Like I just said.

815
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We want to maximize this.

816
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Momentum energy transfer.

817
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So we have to be very light.

818
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This target the particle.

819
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Of course, we want very small, very small noise.

820
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
OK, because of this.

821
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We can only see a very small signal.

822
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So there will be enough.

823
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Signal to noise ratio.

824
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
OK.

825
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Back to just now.

826
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We want the sensitivity of sub-Kev.

827
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
OK.

828
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It takes a few tens of EVs.

829
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Probably below.

830
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Then do this.

831
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
GEV or lighter particle.

832
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
To see things.

833
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
OK.

834
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Of course, there is also a very important thing.

835
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We must be able to know very clearly.

836
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The signal I see now.

837
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's from the Dark Matter hit me.

838
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Instead of inexplicably.

839
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Things in the environment hit my detector.

840
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But if the energy is very high today.

841
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
This thing is relatively easy.

842
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Because of this kind of energy in the environment.

843
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
This kind of radioactivity.

844
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
In fact, relatively few.

845
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Otherwise, in fact, people are dead.

846
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
OK, but if you reduce the energy to very low.

847
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
In fact, you are next to the phone.

848
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Cell phone signal.

849
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It looks like that energy.

850
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
If you put it in an experimental environment.

851
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The temperature of the experimental environment.

852
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Black radiation.

853
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That light is also this energy.

854
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So it started to become very, very much.

855
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Low-energy particle.

856
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Keep hitting the detector.

857
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
We need to be able to distinguish.

858
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That's the only way to do this.

859
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So in fact, it is relatively challenging.

860
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
OK.

861
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I won't talk about this picture.

862
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
This picture is actually the thing.

863
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Ok.

864
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Ok, I'm done.

865
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The first part is our motivation.

866
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Do you have any questions?

867
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Hello.

868
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you hear me?

869
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yes, yes, yes.

870
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Then I want to.

871
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm the one who does Neoscience.

872
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So I don't have a background.

873
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But I want to ask.

874
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's how everyone is.

875
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Is it that?

876
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Neutrino.

877
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Oh.

878
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
How do you do it?

879
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Is it?

880
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Is it?

881
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Neutrino.

882
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This question.

883
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Is it?

884
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
OK.

885
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You say.

886
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What if it's Neutrino?

887
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
How do you do it?

888
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Because the sun will emit a lot.

889
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's right.

890
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
This question can actually be divided into two.

891
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The first one is.

892
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm not sure.

893
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What you want to ask is.

894
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
How do we know?

895
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Neutrino can't be a dark matter.

896
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
How do we know?

897
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
How do we know?

898
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
How do we know?

899
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
How do we know?

900
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
How do we know?

901
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
How do we know?

902
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
How do we know?

903
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Neutrino can't be a dark matter?

904
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's still our detector.

905
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What about the signal you see is not Neutrino?

906
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
How do you know?

907
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.

908
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.

909
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It should be said that the sun will emit a lot of Neutrino.

910
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If you have to first exclude.

911
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
If you have to first exclude.

912
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Is it possible that Neutrino is not?

913
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And then do this experiment near the Earth to make it feasible?

914
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because the sun if it is.

915
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The sun is not a very strong interferer.

916
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's right.

917
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's right.

918
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Okay.

919
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The first point.

920
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
We can use the solar system.

921
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The solar system.

922
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Why is it called Neutrino now?

923
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
This is that.

924
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Neutrino's distribution is not the same, is it?

925
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But why is Neutrino's distribution the same in all three cases?

926
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's because of the black matter in it.

927
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Black matter is functional.

928
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
There's no our detector has the data.

929
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You are now with us.

930
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
More swing neutrino.

931
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Neutrino does not form, and now it's coming.

932
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Linking together.

933
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Really?

934
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Then let's talk about the dark matter.

935
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It takes a long, long time.

936
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It will slowly gather into what we want now.

937
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The density of the spider web I just showed.

938
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Then attract other particles in.

939
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That time is far more than we know.

940
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The age of the universe so far.

941
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Then the amount of planets produced.

942
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So we know that such a light particle.

943
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Then its interaction is like Neutrino.

944
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Because we actually know a lot about Neutrino.

945
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But it's a good feeling.

946
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But that is to say.

947
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
We know the strength of its interaction.

948
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So we know.

949
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It can't be the dark matter we want.

950
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
OK, unless there's another version of Neutrino.

951
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
That's not.

952
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That's also new physics.

953
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So we know Neutrino.

954
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The first is not to do dark matter.

955
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The second is if today.

956
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
OK, then the sun will still shoot.

957
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We know that kind of Neutrino.

958
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
How do we know?

959
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The signal we see is not Neutrino.

960
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The answer is we don't know.

961
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But we know one thing.

962
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We know how hot the sun is.

963
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We know how much light it emits.

964
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We also know almost.

965
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The principle of emitting this light is.

966
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Which few.

967
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The chain of fusion reactions.

968
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So we know.

969
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Based on its brightness, its heat.

970
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Look at these fusion reactions.

971
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It emits the flux of Neutrino.

972
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
How much should that flow be?

973
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Plus we know.

974
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
This kind of Neutrino through our detector.

975
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
What is the probability of being blocked?

976
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
OK, so we know.

977
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Now the detector sees.

978
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It won't be.

979
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It won't be Neutrino.

980
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Because in theory, in the whole experiment.

981
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The duration will be blocked.

982
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Maybe it's a few zeros.

983
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
In other words, it won't be blocked.

984
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So we know there's no problem.

985
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But based on what I just said.

986
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I know how hot the sun is.

987
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So how many Neutrino have been through the earth.

988
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Through our experiment.

989
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
When our experiment is getting more and more sensitive.

990
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Can be sensitive to.

991
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's worth 47, 48.

992
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
For example, here.

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
48, 49.

994
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
At this time, we will be very sensitive.

995
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
To be able to see that kind of Neutrino.

996
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
At this time, we see any signal.

997
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We can't say.

998
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It is Dark Matter or Neutrino.

999
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So here to dig this yellow line.

1000
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This is what I said.

1001
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The experiment will stop here.

1002
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Because we basically don't have it now.

1003
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Reliable technology can tell.

1004
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Is it Neutrino or Dark Matter?

1005
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
OK.

1006
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Thank you.

1007
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But in fact, there is a potential way.

1008
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
If I can distinguish its direction.

1009
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
They all come from the sun.

1010
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Then I will say that people from the sun.

1011
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
The probability of Neutrino is very high.

1012
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't look over there.

1013
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
OK.

1014
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But what I'm talking about now is.

1015
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
When this particle hits.

1016
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The energy it leaves.

1017
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We only measure energy.

1018
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We didn't measure.

1019
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The direction of this incoming particle.

1020
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So in fact.

1021
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Unless I can identify this thing.

1022
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Otherwise, I can't tell Neutrino.

1023
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The answer is no.

1024
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
OK.

1025
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Excuse me.

1026
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Can I ask another question?

1027
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Please say.

1028
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Just.

1029
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Because I don't understand this at all.

1030
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That.

1031
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
That is, the particle accelerator can.

1032
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Can.

1033
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Can.

1034
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Think of a way to find these heavy particles.

1035
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Heavy quality particles.

1036
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That.

1037
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But for example.

1038
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Very light particles.

1039
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Is there no way to find it with an accelerator?

1040
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So.

1041
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You are looking for Dark Matter.

1042
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Assuming this.

1043
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This.

1044
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
There is a very light particle.

1045
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Then it could also be Dark Matter.

1046
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You may.

1047
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You are looking for Dark Matter.

1048
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It may also be.

1049
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Solve this.

1050
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
For example, find a particularly light particle.

1051
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Then.

1052
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Maybe the theory can't be predicted.

1053
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Or.

1054
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Some theories have been predicted.

1055
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's it.

1056
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But I don't know.

1057
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yes.

1058
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So in fact, the accelerator can find Dark Matter.

1059
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And a lot of people are looking for Dark Matter in the accelerator.

1060
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But.

1061
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Looking for Dark Matter in the accelerator.

1062
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Like you said.

1063
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
In fact, basically.

1064
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The concept is completely different.

1065
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It is.

1066
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You use your known example.

1067
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Think of a way.

1068
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Create Dark Matter.

1069
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Right.

1070
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But.

1071
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It has a very, very practical reason.

1072
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's very difficult to do in the accelerator.

1073
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That is.

1074
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You take two examples you already know.

1075
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Put it together.

1076
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Explode.

1077
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
In addition to producing a Dark Matter.

1078
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It will produce a lot of other examples.

1079
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
In other words.

1080
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Your.

1081
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Next to these.

1082
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
After measuring these explosions.

1083
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
These products.

1084
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
These detectors.

1085
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's like being constantly.

1086
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's like being constantly.

1087
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's like being constantly.

1088
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's like being constantly.

1089
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It has a certain amount of brightness.

1090
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
As long as you do it.

1091
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It will produce a lot of this.

1092
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
This kind of showering.

1093
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This kind of background.

1094
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That.

1095
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You basically can't see it.

1096
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
If you want to see something.

1097
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's smaller than the background of this shower.

1098
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Because what you see is bright.

1099
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So.

1100
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Because of the mechanism of the confrontation.

1101
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Their lower threshold is probably hundreds of GV.

1102
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It's probably here.

1103
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So.

1104
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's probably the accelerator.

1105
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Probably the best.

1106
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Is.

1107
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
From here.

1108
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Above.

1109
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
They can say with confidence.

1110
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
If I see something.

1111
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's Dark Matter.

1112
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But they didn't see it either.

1113
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So they're also drawing a line.

1114
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But down here.

1115
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
They can't have that confidence.

1116
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
They can't have that confidence.

1117
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Say I didn't see it.

1118
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Because their environment is too bright.

1119
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
No, it's too big.

1120
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But that's right.

1121
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You can find it in the accelerator.

1122
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Ok.

1123
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Ok.

1124
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Ok.

1125
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Ok.

1126
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Ok.

1127
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Ok.

1128
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Ok.

1129
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Ok.

1130
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Ok.

1131
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ok.

1132
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Ok.

1133
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Ok.

1134
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Ok.

1135
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Is there a problem?

1136
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Is there a problem?

1137
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So.

1138
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So.

1139
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
My question is.

1140
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That.

1141
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Uh.

1142
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I mean.

1143
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That is to say.

1144
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Standard model.

1145
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Also.

1146
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Also.

1147
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That is to say.

1148
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Assuming there is a lighter example.

1149
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
That.

1150
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Uh-huh.

1151
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Not only in the accelerator.

1152
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I can't see it.

1153
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
That standard model.

1154
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I didn't predict it either.

1155
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But again.

1156
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's right.

1157
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
In fact.

1158
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There is.

1159
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Uh.

1160
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
There is a high possibility of Dark Matter.

1161
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's it.

1162
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So.

1163
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Uh.

1164
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So.

1165
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You are looking for Dark Matter.

1166
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
If you find a lighter model.

1167
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Standard model.

1168
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I can't predict it.

1169
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That.

1170
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Of course.

1171
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's a new.

1172
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
New.

1173
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
New.

1174
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
New.

1175
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Physics.

1176
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Is that right?

1177
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Correct.

1178
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
As long as we see Dark Matter.

1179
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It must be new physics.

1180
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Ok.

1181
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Because Dark Matter itself.

1182
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's not in the Standard Model at all.

1183
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Ok.

1184
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Ok.

1185
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Correct.

1186
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Ok.

1187
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Ok.

1188
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Ok.

1189
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Hello.

1190
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Hello.

1191
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Uh.

1192
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Ian seems to have a problem.

1193
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Ian.

1194
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Hello.

1195
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Because I can't see the projection now.

1196
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So you have to read it for me.

1197
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Hey.

1198
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Ian.

1199
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You have to turn on the microphone.

1200
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
To ask.

1201
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Can't see.

1202
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Can't see.

1203
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Do you want to talk?

1204
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Ah.

1205
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Ok.

1206
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He said that.

1207
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Assuming.

1208
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh.

1209
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Uh.

1210
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Assuming now.

1211
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Dark Matter.

1212
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Uh.

1213
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Uh.

1214
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Uh.

1215
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Uh.

1216
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Uh.

1217
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Uh.

1218
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Uh.

1219
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Uh.

1220
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Uh.

1221
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Uh.

1222
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah.

1223
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
OK.

1224
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
He only said.

1225
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I have to turn back for my microphone.

1226
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
On the sound history.

1227
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
He can finally speak.

1228
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Then there may be time to turn back.

1229
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Because...

1230
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The moment he speaks simple.

1231
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
He wants to make.

1232
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You have to be able to say everything in English.

1233
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
What?

1234
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What are you saying.

1235
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's OK.

1236
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Don't need to be altered.

1237
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It doesn't matter.

1238
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's OK.

1239
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You only have to be able to.

1240
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You worked hard.

1241
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's OK.

1242
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We'll do this.

1243
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And there's another question.

1244
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yes.

1245
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Which is.

1246
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Which is.

1247
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
What Light matter model.

1248
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Is considered to be without dark matter.

1249
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Is considered.

1250
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, no.

1251
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yes, this is his question.

1252
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This thing is like this.

1253
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Just.

1254
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You take something very heavy.

1255
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
To hit something very light.

1256
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
What will the result be?

1257
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You take something very heavy.

1258
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Hit something very light.

1259
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We can imagine.

1260
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Take a truck.

1261
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Hit a window.

1262
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The light is hit very far.

1263
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yes.

1264
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
In fact.

1265
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The first signal you see.

1266
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It will be completely Nonsense.

1267
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Will be super big.

1268
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Then it's gone.

1269
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But in fact.

1270
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He just went through.

1271
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He won't leave the energy.

1272
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Sorry.

1273
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Uh.

1274
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I just said it wrong.

1275
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Because he will go straight through.

1276
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
He won't put energy.

1277
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So he transferred the energy.

1278
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It will still be very strong.

1279
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Uh.

1280
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I have an equation here.

1281
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
OK.

1282
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So this.

1283
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This is that equation.

1284
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
That is to say.

1285
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
If you go to calculate.

1286
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
He left.

1287
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hit.

1288
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Hit.

1289
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Because in fact.

1290
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Hit is the two people.

1291
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Common response.

1292
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
He doesn't care.

1293
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Who hit who.

1294
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Because in fact.

1295
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
In his execution.

1296
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
They are hit.

1297
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You can't tell who hit who.

1298
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
The most effective way.

1299
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Is to hit.

1300
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Hit.

1301
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Hit.

1302
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Hit.

1303
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The most effective way to pass energy to.

1304
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Another person.

1305
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Is.

1306
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Big M is greater than small M.

1307
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But whether it is.

1308
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Big M is greater than small M.

1309
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Or is small M greater than big M.

1310
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
This number will be close to zero.

1311
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That is to say.

1312
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You won't leave the energy.

1313
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So.

1314
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
This question is more like.

1315
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
If today.

1316
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Dark Matter.

1317
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Really move like a proton.

1318
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Then we use electron.

1319
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Is it a good candidate?

1320
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The answer is no.

1321
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Because we will leave.

1322
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Very, very small energy.

1323
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We still can't measure.

1324
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But this thing.

1325
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Effectively.

1326
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Is all these experiments.

1327
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
What to do.

1328
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But they didn't see anything.

1329
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So.

1330
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I want to try.

1331
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I have a question.

1332
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I want to ask.

1333
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You just said.

1334
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
We can control.

1335
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Just.

1336
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Of course.

1337
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
At first.

1338
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Use paper.

1339
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
More.

1340
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
More people use.

1341
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The method.

1342
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Then.

1343
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Because I can't find it.

1344
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So use electrons.

1345
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So you.

1346
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You just said.

1347
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We can control.

1348
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Paper and electrons.

1349
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What do you mean by control?

1350
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
What does it mean?

1351
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If.

1352
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I said control.

1353
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
In fact, it is.

1354
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You can spend money.

1355
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Easy to buy materials.

1356
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
OK.

1357
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So.

1358
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
OK.

1359
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yes.

1360
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I will talk about some.

1361
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
More exotic.

1362
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yes.

1363
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Ah.

1364
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
If the electronic.

1365
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If you can't find it.

1366
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Is it possible to use electricity?

1367
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Because in fact.

1368
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Electricity.

1369
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Electricity and electricity.

1370
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
In fact.

1371
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It's about the same.

1372
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
No.

1373
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
OK.

1374
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
OK.

1375
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Percentage.

1376
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That's about the same to me.

1377
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What we're talking about now is.

1378
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
If you can find.

1379
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Smaller things.

1380
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
For example, that kind.

1381
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Uh.

1382
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What is it called?

1383
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Dirac.

1384
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's super.

1385
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So effectively.

1386
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You can destroy one.

1387
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
For example.

1388
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Quasi-particle.

1389
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That's all possible.

1390
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But.

1391
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Very.

1392
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Expensive.

1393
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Ah.

1394
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yes.

1395
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Good.

1396
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
OK.

1397
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That.

1398
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
OK.

1399
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Good.

1400
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Then I'll talk about it first.

1401
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That is.

1402
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Super CDMA.

1403
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
HPEV detector.

1404
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This thing.

1405
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
What is it?

1406
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Ahem.

1407
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Ahem.

1408
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
OK.

1409
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Sorry.

1410
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Good.

1411
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Now here you see a picture.

1412
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
This picture.

1413
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Is trying to describe this.

1414
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Germanium.

1415
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
This.

1416
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The crystal.

1417
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
OK.

1418
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It's a gold.

1419
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Black.

1420
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That's the white line.

1421
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Like this.

1422
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Hit him.

1423
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Then bounce away.

1424
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
OK.

1425
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Then he left some energy.

1426
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
What about this energy?

1427
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Will come out.

1428
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Ahem.

1429
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
This will come out.

1430
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Shake this.

1431
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
This crystal lattice.

1432
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So he'll shake there.

1433
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Vibrate.

1434
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That vibrates this thing.

1435
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's actually a.

1436
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Signal.

1437
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's called Fona.

1438
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
OK.

1439
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And then.

1440
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
At the same time, he'll hit this.

1441
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Electronic electric team.

1442
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Because he has enough energy.

1443
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
He can.

1444
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
He's next to the electronic electric team.

1445
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Sorry.

1446
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So.

1447
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Hey.

1448
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Then we have two signals.

1449
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Can measure.

1450
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
One is this.

1451
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Lattice vibration.

1452
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's called Fona.

1453
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Ah.

1454
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The other one is this.

1455
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Electronic electric team.

1456
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Ah.

1457
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So now.

1458
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
How do you do it?

1459
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It's just that we put a big piece of this.

1460
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Crystal.

1461
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
This is.

1462
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
10 centimeters.

1463
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
OK.

1464
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This is 10 centimeters.

1465
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
What about its thickness?

1466
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's 4.5 centimeters.

1467
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It's 5 centimeters.

1468
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's a big piece.

1469
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You don't seem to be any.

1470
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The thickness of silicon used by TSMC.

1471
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's a big one.

1472
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And then.

1473
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Let's take this thing.

1474
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Let it work.

1475
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Ah, when it's hit by Jack Berry.

1476
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
At the time.

1477
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
These fans will drift to it.

1478
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
This one.

1479
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
To Spread to this.

1480
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
This crystal surface.

1481
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This one.

1482
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Hey, this electron pair is, too.

1483
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We'll pull it to the surface of a power plant.

1484
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
What about now?

1485
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
We're on this surface.

1486
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Do this microbi Britt consideration.

1487
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We're doing a guided circuit.

1488
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So, we're going to use this sugar to rival the arrows.

1489
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Interrupted by these two signals.

1490
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It really changes to measure the two clicks.

1491
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
First, we calculate it.

1492
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We calculate pi 2025 by zeros.

1493
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And then we measure pi.

1494
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Well, we can adjust it.

1495
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Interrupt change to measure the Bacon and that organization.

1496
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay, this is the concept.

1497
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Okay, then he's got a lot of them in our video to do a different operation mode.

1498
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But what I want to talk about first is this.

1499
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I don't next to meet you.

1500
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Well, it's real, it's a side classical.

1501
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Now, come in hop okay.

1502
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Generate an otmomert here.

1503
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's all electronic.

1504
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Okay, and then I'm here to give him a super big power plant.

1505
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Okay, then he's going to pull this electronic and electric, and he's going to rush up and down here very quickly.

1506
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Okay, and in the process?

1507
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Because this electronic electric will be far more than he can travel in this lattice.

1508
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The highest terminal velocity.

1509
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So what he's going to do is he's going to start generating.

1510
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
He's going to lose or he's going to generate more energy into this.

1511
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Crystal inside to balance his speed, he's going to stay at terminal velocity.

1512
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So you're going to have a lot of this green arrow.

1513
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
This is a secondary phenomenon.

1514
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay, so you can imagine if we give him a super big bias voltage.

1515
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
He's going to generate a lot of wind.

1516
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So we basically just put an electronic electric signal.

1517
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Let him become a big power plant.

1518
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Let him become a super big wind signal.

1519
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And then we use this method to recover.

1520
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Oh, so we created a few electronic electric teams in front of us.

1521
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Okay, so we're going to use this method.

1522
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We just have to give him a few dozen to a hundred or two hundred volts of this power difference.

1523
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Then he can produce dozens of times to a hundred or two hundred times of this.

1524
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
This is our approach.

1525
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Then we basically measure this purple piece, which is the sensor.

1526
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Okay, this is a piece of paper we published last year.

1527
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
We made an R&D device.

1528
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
This device is 2 centimeters.

1529
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
This edge is 2 centimeters.

1530
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
This is a silicon crystal.

1531
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It's 4 kilometers thick.

1532
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So it's 0.4 centimeters.

1533
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Then we added him.

1534
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We added him 150 volts of this.

1535
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay, so we're going to use this high voltage method to generate a lot of secondary.

1536
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Then we use this piece of silver.

1537
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'll talk about it later.

1538
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
To measure this wind.

1539
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay, so we can use this method.

1540
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What we get is this signal to noise ratio.

1541
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's 0.7 percent of the electronic whole pair.

1542
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
For example, this is a single electron hole.

1543
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
This is a horizontal energy.

1544
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Then the axis is the histogram.

1545
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It doesn't matter what it is.

1546
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
This is a single electron hole pair.

1547
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
This is a signal of two, three, four electron hole pairs.

1548
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And what about its width?

1549
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's about 7 percent.

1550
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That's what it means.

1551
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So we have resolution to see.

1552
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Counting this single, single, single, electron hole pair.

1553
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Okay, so we found that we can do it without fear.

1554
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Add this bias voltage to super big.

1555
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We can't see the super, super big signal to noise ratio.

1556
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The answer is no.

1557
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Because when we add more than one breakdown voltage.

1558
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
This whole crystal becomes like a semiconductor.

1559
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's like an island.

1560
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's been crazy, it's been passing through.

1561
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It will smear.

1562
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We can count this dark matter signal ability.

1563
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So we do this breakdown voltage.

1564
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
We found that we don't want to go beyond this breakdown voltage.

1565
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We operate at the bottom of the breakdown voltage.

1566
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
We see that it will always have two or three hertz like this.

1567
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Two or three signals every second.

1568
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Then keep coming out, keep coming out.

1569
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
The part that comes out is the pink part.

1570
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's completely different from what we expect.

1571
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The signal that dark matter can produce is different.

1572
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So our assumption is that.

1573
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
OK, there's a background here.

1574
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
We don't know why.

1575
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It keeps leaking.

1576
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
OK, but we don't know.

1577
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But based on such a background.

1578
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
We can also set a limit.

1579
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Is it consistent with this background being or not?

1580
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
OK, I'm going to do this calculation.

1581
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
What about the calculation?

1582
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You can see the picture in the upper right corner.

1583
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
OK, CDMS Run 1.

1584
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I just said.

1585
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
In traditional experiments, we are all at 10 GeV.

1586
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Or higher to a few TeV to draw this limit.

1587
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
But now I'm going back to the experiment.

1588
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
We put this detector in our refrigerator.

1589
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Then I gave it a day and a night.

1590
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Then this detector is very small.

1591
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
This detector is as big as a rubber band.

1592
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
OK, we immediately set a world leading limit.

1593
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
What is the world leading limit?

1594
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's very simple.

1595
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's not very sensitive to the very bottom.

1596
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It can measure very small probability.

1597
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's just because we can be sensitive to very small energy.

1598
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So we drew a place where no one has ever been able to draw.

1599
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
OK, you can see this place.

1600
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
This is sub-mEV.

1601
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So 1 GeV is here.

1602
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
10 GeV is what I said.

1603
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
WIMP Search is from here to the right.

1604
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So we immediately drew a big piece here.

1605
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
This is last year.

1606
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
OK, let's say this is just a demonstration.

1607
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
This concept is very efficient.

1608
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Then we are this year.

1609
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
OK, we have to be very formal.

1610
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Let's make this thing a measurement on the ground.

1611
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Then we are actually yesterday.

1612
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We just unblinded all our data.

1613
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So we should be within a month.

1614
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Everyone doesn't have to sleep on Christmas.

1615
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Then we will put the pair on the archive.

1616
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So there will be a new one in a month.

1617
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Then stay tuned.

1618
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I can't talk about numbers, but I can say.

1619
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
We redesigned this R&D device.

1620
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Because we are from here.

1621
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Then go over here and compare it.

1622
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Theoretically, this should be a resolution detector.

1623
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Then we see the difference.

1624
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Then we understand it.

1625
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We redesigned.

1626
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Then the resolution is significantly improved.

1627
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Then what's more important is.

1628
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Back to just now.

1629
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Because I said it would have two or three hertz of leakage.

1630
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Because I don't understand this leakage.

1631
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So if there is a leakage to a certain extent.

1632
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I said OK.

1633
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Then cut it off here.

1634
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The above is a good detector.

1635
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's hard for me to say anything below.

1636
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Because my background is too high.

1637
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So the most important, the most crucial, is to set a limit.

1638
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
In fact, it is to reduce this leakage.

1639
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Then we are actually Achieve Leakage Current Reduction Goal.

1640
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So this is very important.

1641
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
What's more interesting is.

1642
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
We have been in this year or so.

1643
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
In fact, nearly two years.

1644
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
We know more about Silicon Crystal.

1645
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Interaction with its environment.

1646
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So we can model.

1647
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
That is, these can be produced.

1648
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Not quantized signal.

1649
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
What is the distribution?

1650
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Then we can model it.

1651
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So basically, I can say.

1652
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We project to set again.

1653
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
We're leading limit.

1654
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
If not discovery.

1655
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So stay tuned.

1656
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
This is what happens.

1657
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Okay, so here is CDMSHVEV.

1658
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Is there a problem?

1659
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
This is a concept.

1660
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Because it's more like saying.

1661
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I want to talk about technology later.

1662
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But if you have any questions about this part.

1663
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You can ask now.

1664
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
OK, if you don't have any questions.

1665
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Welcome to take a look.

1666
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
This 180410697.

1667
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This, right.

1668
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It should be HVEV and Sensai.

1669
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Are the two that can be set to the lowest.

1670
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
What is this called?

1671
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Gathering the cross-section experiment.

1672
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Right.

1673
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Okay.

1674
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Then go down.

1675
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
The rest of the part I want to talk about is this.

1676
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Before I talk about it.

1677
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I want to talk about it first.

1678
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
In the detector I just showed.

1679
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What is his technology?

1680
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
OK, now you see a little.

1681
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
A little, a little, a little, a little.

1682
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It's a piece of metal.

1683
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Then we put it in this.

1684
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It will become a super conductor.

1685
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
OK, then.

1686
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
If there is a pink part today.

1687
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The pink part is just that.

1688
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
The big piece of that.

1689
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
If I produce this interaction today.

1690
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Then it will float up.

1691
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Then go into this silver part.

1692
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
OK, it will destroy this.

1693
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Then this will float in all the way.

1694
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
What about this floating in?

1695
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Sorry, it destroys.

1696
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's called QP.

1697
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Then it will change this.

1698
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The state of the conductor.

1699
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
OK, it will be from.

1700
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
This is the original conductor.

1701
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
The horizontal axis is the conductor.

1702
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The horizontal axis is the effective temperature.

1703
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That little silver effective temperature.

1704
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
OK, he was originally a zero conductor.

1705
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Will be very fast transition to.

1706
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
There are nine conductors.

1707
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's a normal conductor.

1708
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Then we just put it.

1709
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
In this state of this transition.

1710
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
As long as there is a little temperature.

1711
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Or the change of energy in this film.

1712
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This little inside.

1713
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We can see a big signal.

1714
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We use this method to measure.

1715
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But there are some problems.

1716
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
His problem is.

1717
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
This is a phase transition.

1718
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So his range is very small.

1719
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
From a little energy to.

1720
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's full, it's just a little bit.

1721
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So his dynamic range.

1722
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Is very small.

1723
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
That's usually what you need.

1724
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Extra.

1725
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Circuit.

1726
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And it's going to be in the fridge.

1727
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
To help him dissipate energy.

1728
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Or help him divert that energy.

1729
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Feedback, so we can.

1730
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It's really stable.

1731
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Operate our detector in this.

1732
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Transition.

1733
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And then, because he's actually a film.

1734
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
He's from a zero conductor to a conductor.

1735
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's also a super small conductor.

1736
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So he's a conventional.

1737
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The impedance of this electronics.

1738
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Is not match.

1739
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So he usually requires.

1740
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
This is a cryo electronics.

1741
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
To do this.

1742
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
When it's time to do it.

1743
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Low impedance match.

1744
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So this is usually.

1745
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
This is a very troublesome thing.

1746
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And the most important thing is.

1747
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Typical can be used to do this.

1748
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Transition edge sensor material.

1749
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's actually not suitable.

1750
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Come to this.

1751
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So it really has to be produced.

1752
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
A ts sensor that can catch phonon.

1753
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
We also have a trapper.

1754
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Put these phonons.

1755
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Let him run over there, so there are several layers.

1756
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Then this micro fabrication is very complicated.

1757
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Then why do I want to talk about those?

1758
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Because those are basically this kid.

1759
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The problem of the customer service.

1760
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Then I'll talk about how to do it.

1761
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
This operation is good.

1762
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The same energy comes in today.

1763
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
This picture is the earliest paper.

1764
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
He was imagined to be hit by light.

1765
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But you can imagine.

1766
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
After he broke up.

1767
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
He's on that.

1768
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The effect of the metal on it.

1769
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It's not just the change of the conductor.

1770
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It will also produce.

1771
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
The change of the electric sense.

1772
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
The change of the electric sense and the change of the conductor is not the same.

1773
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
The superconductor.

1774
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It's been produced all the time.

1775
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
He won't have a conductor.

1776
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Until the transition.

1777
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Suddenly, a lot of changes.

1778
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And then he went to the normal state.

1779
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But if today is.

1780
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Inductance.

1781
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
The change of being broken.

1782
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
In fact, it is relatively low function.

1783
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
He can operate at a lower temperature.

1784
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
That is to say, as long as I have one.

1785
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Enough ice in the refrigerator.

1786
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
The transition temperature is much lower than mine.

1787
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I can operate.

1788
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
In fact, I do not need to care.

1789
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Do I have a very complicated electronic?

1790
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Can control it?

1791
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
This is very important.

1792
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
What I'm talking about today is the change of the electric sense.

1793
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
How do we make it a good sensor?

1794
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
This is a variable electric sense.

1795
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I put it together with a capacitor.

1796
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It becomes a vibrator.

1797
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
OK, so if today.

1798
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
This electric sense is.

1799
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Eat a little energy.

1800
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
A little change.

1801
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That's frequency space today.

1802
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
OK, so frequency space.

1803
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
This is F, this is S21.

1804
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
If you do micro wave S21.

1805
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Then there is a resonance.

1806
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
He will run.

1807
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And because there are more inside.

1808
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
This thermodynamic activity.

1809
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
In fact, it is a quasi-particle recombination.

1810
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So this resonator.

1811
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Or this resonator.

1812
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
This quality factor will be reduced.

1813
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So it's not just this.

1814
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Resonance frequency will run.

1815
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Its fat will become fat.

1816
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So it will be like this.

1817
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
From this black to the dot, then run back.

1818
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Then we look at this.

1819
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
OK, we will know that.

1820
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Oh, here is the signal.

1821
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
In fact, how do we realize such a circuit?

1822
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Actually nothing.

1823
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Just put it all together.

1824
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
We have a lot of this little.

1825
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
LC, LC, LC.

1826
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Then put it all together.

1827
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Then I measured its transmission.

1828
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Or S21.

1829
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I just put all these.

1830
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
These resonators.

1831
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
The resonant frequency is slightly adjusted to be different.

1832
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Then I measured S21 today.

1833
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You will see one by one.

1834
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
One by one, one by one, one by one, one by one.

1835
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
OK, then this resonance.

1836
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Will map to, for example, I know.

1837
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
By design, this person.

1838
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
He should resonate at this frequency.

1839
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This person should resonate at this frequency.

1840
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So I just monitor this one.

1841
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I know he was hit.

1842
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
This one runs.

1843
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I know he was hit.

1844
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So this.

1845
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
This is how we do this pixelization.

1846
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
This concept.

1847
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
In fact, you can see that this is a waveguide.

1848
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Then this is a.

1849
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Electrical circuit.

1850
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Then this is a capacitor.

1851
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
This waveguide is coupled to it.

1852
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
This waveguide is coupled to it.

1853
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
In fact, everyone will see it like this.

1854
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
There is a waveguide here.

1855
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.

1856
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
OK.

1857
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Then every little island.

1858
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's all a pixel.

1859
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Sorry, but we can go back.

1860
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Compare to say.

1861
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
What if you use TES?

1862
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Because the TES is too small.

1863
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Small to measure.

1864
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You have to put a lot of this little island.

1865
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
All connected.

1866
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So in fact, these people are all connected.

1867
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Make a sensor together.

1868
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
These people are all connected together.

1869
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So this chip.

1870
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
2 cm by 2 cm.

1871
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's just two channels.

1872
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The signals are all clamped together.

1873
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But a 3-inch wafer like this.

1874
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's 80 channels.

1875
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Then we now think that 80 channels.

1876
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Do this.

1877
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Positioning is good enough.

1878
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So we don't actually have to push this detector anymore.

1879
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
We may have to take this detector.

1880
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
To do the dark matter search.

1881
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But we are for this thing.

1882
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Some analysis of robustness.

1883
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I don't know if there's a paper here.

1884
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
If you can go and see.

1885
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We think we can put 200 channels.

1886
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Then there will be no confusion.

1887
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So basically.

1888
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
This is the future super cdms no lab detector.

1889
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
There are a lot of little dots.

1890
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
But they are all connected together.

1891
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So in the end, this big piece is a pixel.

1892
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This big piece is a pixel.

1893
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It probably looks like this.

1894
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It has 6 pixels.

1895
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Then we have 80.

1896
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Then we can do more than 200.

1897
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Because in fact.

1898
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Energy resolution wise.

1899
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
We have measured.

1900
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Comparable energy resolution.

1901
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But more importantly.

1902
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Recent results suggest.

1903
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
We can do sub-EB resolution.

1904
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Then of course.

1905
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
In money wise.

1906
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It reduces 60% of fabrication complexity.

1907
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Because in fact.

1908
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
This whole piece.

1909
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Is single layer film.

1910
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So.

1911
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Compared with this.

1912
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
We are actually a mask.

1913
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Then deposit.

1914
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Then etch.

1915
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Then we have a complete whole circuit.

1916
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So we reduced.

1917
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
60% to 70% of this.

1918
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
If we go to calculate the steps.

1919
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Then the chemical used is much less.

1920
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So this fabrication EO is much higher.

1921
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And we can easily do.

1922
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
100 times of this.

1923
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Pixelization.

1924
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Is multiplexibility.

1925
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Then.

1926
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
We don't need thermoelectric feedback.

1927
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
We just need to.

1928
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Make it much lower than TC.

1929
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Then we don't need.

1930
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Squid amplifier.

1931
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Because in fact by design.

1932
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
This waveguide is 50 ohms.

1933
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So we only need 50 ohms.

1934
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Just connect two coax.

1935
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So this is very simple.

1936
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
This is very important to CLR.

1937
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Then this is the second page.

1938
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Then let's talk about.

1939
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
How high can we expect?

1940
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Because we are dominated by.

1941
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Low-noise amplifier.

1942
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So in other words.

1943
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
As long as I can lower my.

1944
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The noise temperature of the amplifier.

1945
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I can.

1946
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Increase my.

1947
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Resolution here.

1948
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Then we use this amplifier now.

1949
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
5K noise temperature.

1950
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Then our collaborator in JPL.

1951
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
He made a low-noise.

1952
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Low-noise amplifier.

1953
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So I just change this to me.

1954
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I have a factor here.

1955
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
OK.

1956
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Then.

1957
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We found one thing.

1958
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
We have to do this match filter.

1959
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Filter what is noise.

1960
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
What is this pulse template.

1961
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
If we have this today.

1962
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
This pulse decay time.

1963
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
This time constant is longer.

1964
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
We can be on this match filter.

1965
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Filter more of this.

1966
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Noise spectrum.

1967
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Then this characteristic.

1968
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
If the characteristic time of this film becomes longer.

1969
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
We can.

1970
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Increase better signal to noise ratio.

1971
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
In this paper.

1972
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Demonstrate that they can put this time.

1973
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Increase to 3ms.

1974
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Then we are now 100 microseconds.

1975
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
So OK.

1976
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Then I put this factor in.

1977
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Do I put this factor in?

1978
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
OK.

1979
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Let's not say 3000.

1980
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Let's say 1500 microseconds.

1981
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
This is actually my boss.

1982
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Another experiment.

1983
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
They put.

1984
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
This part.

1985
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Made into material.

1986
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
What does it mean?

1987
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
He put this sensitive inductor.

1988
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Really we can measure.

1989
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Material.

1990
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
The other part.

1991
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Another kind.

1992
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The gap is bigger.

1993
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Bigger material.

1994
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So they won't eat the wind.

1995
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
By this difference.

1996
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Just by this geometric ratio.

1997
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
He can increase his sensitivity.

1998
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Then we can do the same thing.

1999
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
That is actually one more layer.

2000
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Much less than TS.

2001
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Then we add it up.

2002
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
This ratio.

2003
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Then.

2004
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Recently.

2005
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Recently, there is one in Europe.

2006
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Do that group.

2007
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
They are doing this thing.

2008
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
They propose a very interesting one.

2009
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
We actually have to calculate.

2010
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
How much we have created.

2011
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So if you are today.

2012
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
This superconductor.

2013
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Very small.

2014
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Very small.

2015
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You can break a lot.

2016
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So they used this.

2017
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Low gap.

2018
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Very small.

2019
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
This material.

2020
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
We use aluminum now.

2021
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
They can use it.

2022
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
From 0.2.

2023
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
0.2.

2024
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
0.2.

2025
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
0.05.

2026
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
This is also a change.

2027
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So we put everything.

2028
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Has been demonstrated.

2029
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Bring it all in.

2030
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
We will.

2031
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Bring in the resolution we already have.

2032
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Rescale.

2033
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
The result we get is 36.

2034
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
That is to say.

2035
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
We are no longer doing.

2036
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Or we do.

2037
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Ionization counting.

2038
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
We basically have 36.

2039
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Resolution.

2040
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Of course, we can take this thing.

2041
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Take it instead of TES.

2042
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Continue to put it on the silicon substrate.

2043
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Test this.

2044
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Or this ionization.

2045
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Then we can do another thing.

2046
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Is that we put a bunch of kids over there.

2047
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Directly take the kids to the dark matter.

2048
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Then we can count.

2049
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
This kind of quantum.

2050
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
This is our plan.

2051
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Summarize.

2052
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
We think now.

2053
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Within 5 to 10 years.

2054
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Humans can either find WIMP.

2055
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Or we will have a long one.

2056
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
No progress.

2057
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
So everyone is now.

2058
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Working hard to think about it.

2059
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Can we shift to low mass dark matter?

2060
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
There are still a lot of models.

2061
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Not tested yet.

2062
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
We need to have.

2063
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil.

2064
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Two at the same time.

2065
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Because in fact.

2066
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
In addition to electronic recoil.

2067
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Can measure very small energy.

2068
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Nuclear recoil can help us distinguish.

2069
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
What is the signal?

2070
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
What is the background?

2071
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
This is an important thing to start now.

2072
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Requires substantial improvement.

2073
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
In low-threshold technology.

2074
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
This is the second part.

2075
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
CDMX HPEV demonstration.

2076
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
We have the ability to count.

2077
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We give it a day.

2078
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
One day on the surface of the lab.

2079
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
We can set a good limit.

2080
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Of course, our detector.

2081
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Has been taken to the tunnel.

2082
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So the next round.

2083
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Will be the underground round.

2084
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
One day on the surface of the lab.

2085
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
We can constrain.

2086
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
0.4 MeV dark matter mass.

2087
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
The most important thing is the KIT part.

2088
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
We demonstrate competitive energy resolution.

2089
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
The most important thing is.

2090
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It is actually.

2091
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Theoretical prediction.

2092
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
If we put all the design numbers.

2093
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It is quite consistent.

2094
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Then we are confident.

2095
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So we can adapt.

2096
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
What others have demonstrated.

2097
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Assuming we really have.

2098
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So many resources to adapt.

2099
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Each one.

2100
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Its outlook is 100 times.

2101
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Resolution improvement.

2102
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
It is.

2103
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Flexible optimization.

2104
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You want good energy resolution.

2105
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Just make a pixel.

2106
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Let all the photons hit you.

2107
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Or you can do 500 pixels.

2108
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Then you can have a good.

2109
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Position reconstruction or tracking.

2110
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
In other words.

2111
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
You can reject the background.

2112
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
When we really want to run dark matter devices.

2113
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
This will still need to be redesigned.

2114
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And then the point is.

2115
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It is very easy and reliable fabrication.

2116
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
This is very important for the future.

2117
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Because the students know.

2118
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It is very likely that the device has not been done well.

2119
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So if it's easy to do, it's very important.

2120
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
OK.

2121
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Because it is very simple.

2122
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It basically does not have.

2123
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Just put in an amplifier.

2124
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Then you can run.

2125
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
OK, that's it.

2126
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Thank you.

2127
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Hello everyone.

2128
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Does anyone have a question?

2129
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
We are good.

2130
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Good.

2131
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Good.

2132
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Good.

2133
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Good.

2134
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Good.

2135
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Good.

2136
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Good.

2137
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Good.

2138
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Good.

2139
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Good.

2140
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Good.

2141
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I want to ask.

2142
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
That is.

2143
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Is that Ding Zhaozhong.

2144
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
His group is looking for WIMP.

2145
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And this is not even about to the device?

2146
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
To the space or test.

2147
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
The test is actually done on earth.

2148
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
If we want to.

2149
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The environment of this experiment.

2150
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
A better environment.

2151
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Not actually going to the sky.

2152
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Because we actually measured directly.

2153
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
We hope to go through everything we already know.

2154
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
All kinds of things.

2155
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And then hit our detector.

2156
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But our environment is full of cosmic rays.

2157
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So we actually have the best environment.

2158
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
It's underground.

2159
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It can be very natural to use the earth's shell to help us isolate the cosmic rays.

2160
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
But we already know.

2161
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Can go through almost everything.

2162
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You go to the bottom of the moon.

2163
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Relatively, you show off the more cosmic rays.

2164
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
But the rate you leave.

2165
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
That is.

2166
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
So most of our experiments are.

2167
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Eventually, it's going to be done underground.

2168
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
For example, mines and so on.

2169
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
But Ding Zhaozhong's experiment.

2170
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
If you're talking about AMS or AMS.

2171
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
What if it's 02 now?

2172
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
He's not measuring dark matter.

2173
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
He's measuring cosmic rays.

2174
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The anomaly.

2175
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And then if this anomaly.

2176
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's a very, very strong anomaly.

2177
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
They can try to explain.

2178
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So is there any dark matter?

2179
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
For example, decay.

2180
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Or produce such anomalies.

2181
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
For example, suddenly there is a certain kind of energy.

2182
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
On the spectrum of cosmic rays.

2183
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
There are a lot of non-continuous peaks.

2184
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Then it might be dark matter.

2185
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So they're actually measuring cosmic rays.

2186
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So they want to go to the strongest part of the cosmic rays.

2187
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So they want to go to the atmosphere.

2188
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Because the atmosphere will actually block the cosmic rays.

2189
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So they went to the space station.

2190
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
The principle is probably like this.

2191
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
OK.

2192
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
OK.

2193
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
OK.

2194
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
OK.

2195
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
OK.

2196
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I want to ask another question.

2197
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
OK.

2198
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It's a bit of an unexpected.

2199
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
But.

2200
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I want to ask if there is anyone.

2201
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You're measuring those photons now.

2202
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Right?

2203
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And then magnify the signal.

2204
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Is there anyone.

2205
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Like using that legal.

2206
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
That is, he measured.

2207
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
For example, you hit it.

2208
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Then there may be some very small particles.

2209
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yes.

2210
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I actually.

2211
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I really like this kind of research.

2212
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Because.

2213
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You can ask a very legitimate question.

2214
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
That is to say.

2215
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
In fact, we are now.

2216
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
All dark matter will be blocked by us.

2217
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Interaction is imaginary.

2218
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Because the only thing we know.

2219
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Dark matter will really interact.

2220
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Observed is through gravity.

2221
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
If I say I'm going to design an experiment.

2222
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Is to use gravity as gravity.

2223
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
To measure dark matter.

2224
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
How sensitive do I want to be?

2225
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Or what kind of model is dark matter?

2226
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I measured it.

2227
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Basically, your question is like this.

2228
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
The answer is.

2229
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Someone is thinking about this.

2230
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It's not that I can't do it.

2231
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
But the first dark matter is very, very heavy.

2232
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
How heavy is it?

2233
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's about 0.0.

2234
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Planck's mass.

2235
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I don't know if you know Planck's mass.

2236
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
We think all gravity.

2237
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
The theory will break down the physical limit.

2238
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Now.

2239
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Now we are discussing these scales.

2240
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
What 30 times.

2241
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
No, sorry.

2242
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Then.

2243
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
This is what they are thinking about.

2244
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
They can use laser.

2245
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Put some nanoparticles.

2246
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Press it with laser light.

2247
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Hold nanoparticles.

2248
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Then take it.

2249
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Line up in a vacuum chamber.

2250
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Line up in a vacuum chamber.

2251
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
These nanoparticles.

2252
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
If the little pig is hit by dark matter.

2253
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
No, sorry.

2254
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
It is passed by dark matter.

2255
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Then the weight of the dark matter particle.

2256
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Will affect the position of these little pigs.

2257
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Then they will start to shake.

2258
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It's like a gravity wave.

2259
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
The mirror of LIGO.

2260
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
They can use this method to measure.

2261
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But I think this is a good question.

2262
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And someone is doing R&D.

2263
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
This is very interesting.

2264
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
This is very interesting.

2265
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Can I ask?

2266
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Strange details.

2267
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Why do you use such a thick wafer?

2268
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Why do you use such a thick wafer?

2269
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Or is the whole piece of silicon?

2270
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Or is the whole piece of silicon?

2271
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yes, the whole piece is silicon.

2272
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Ok, I'll leave it here.

2273
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
In fact, this thickness is so thick.

2274
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
This is 10 cm.

2275
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
This is 4 inches.

2276
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
4 inches wafer.

2277
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
The thickness is a big piece.

2278
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
It's like a big piece of silicon.

2279
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
You don't cut it into pieces.

2280
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You cut it into pieces.

2281
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
This is not a wafer crystal.

2282
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Why do you do this?

2283
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Because we found one thing.

2284
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Of course you can say that my thickness is 1 km.

2285
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And then I have 10 pieces.

2286
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Or my thickness is 1 cm.

2287
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
But I only have one piece.

2288
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Its total mass.

2289
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Or the total number of neutron protons it gives you.

2290
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's the same.

2291
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So in theory, your experimental sensitivity is the same.

2292
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
But we found one thing.

2293
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
In the whole process of fabrication.

2294
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And in the process of transportation.

2295
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
The cosmic radiation has been constantly hitting.

2296
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
The cosmic radiation has been constantly hitting.

2297
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
And then there's a lot of dirt in the air.

2298
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
A lot of radioactivity has also been touching our wafer.

2299
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And then there's a lot of dirt in the air.

2300
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And then there's a lot of radioactivity has also been touching our wafer.

2301
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Whether it's sticking or producing.

2302
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Whether it's sticking or producing.

2303
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
These elements.

2304
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So minimize the surface area.

2305
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So minimize the surface area.

2306
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
The total radioactivity of the whole experiment.

2307
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
So we want it to be a big piece.

2308
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Not a lot of small pieces.

2309
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Not a lot of small pieces.

2310
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Does this make sense?

2311
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Does this make sense?

2312
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
But I mean, why is it so thick?

2313
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
But I mean, why is it so thick?

2314
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
But I mean, why is it so thick?

2315
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Because it's very thick.

2316
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It means that it's very small on the same quality.

2317
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Or we have the same thickness.

2318
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Or we have the same total weight.

2319
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
We can also use a thin piece of stone.

2320
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But its surface area is very large.

2321
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Ah, I see what you mean.

2322
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Ah, I see what you mean.

2323
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Ah, I see what you mean.

2324
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Ah, I see what you mean.

2325
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Can I ask a question?

2326
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
How do you do calibration for detectors?

2327
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
How do you do calibration for detectors?

2328
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
How do you do calibration for detectors?

2329
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
This is a bit complicated.

2330
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Let me talk about this first.

2331
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Let me talk about this first.

2332
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
This HVEV.

2333
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
We actually hit it with a laser.

2334
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
We have a fiber.

2335
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
We have a fiber.

2336
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
We have a fiber.

2337
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Because you use a pulse laser.

2338
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Because you use a pulse laser.

2339
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
We can see this spectrum.

2340
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
We can see this spectrum.

2341
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
This is calibration.

2342
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
This is calibration.

2343
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2344
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2345
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2346
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2347
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2348
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2349
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2350
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2351
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2352
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2353
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2354
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2355
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2356
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.

2357
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Rayleigh active source 1k EV.
