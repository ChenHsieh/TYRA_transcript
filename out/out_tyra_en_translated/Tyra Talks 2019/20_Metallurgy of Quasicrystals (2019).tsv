0	5600	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taiwan Radar Talk.
5600	7920	I am today's host, Shi-An Hong.
7920	11200	I am currently a post-doctoral student at the University of Michigan.
11200	14240	Today's speaker is Dr. Hwang Chung-Ren.
14240	18400	He is currently a post-doctoral student at the University of Tokyo, Japan,
18400	26960	and the Japan Research Institute for Human Materials and Materials.
26960	33840	His research focuses on the application of crystalline materials and their structural characteristics.
33840	36480	This is his main interest.
36480	42320	It seems like you are about to get your Ph.D.
42320	44320	Yes, I am a bit busy recently.
44320	49680	Today's topic is the metallurgy of quasicrystals.
49680	56400	So let's welcome Dr. Chung-Ren to give us a speech.
56400	65680	Before we start, please remember to turn on your microphones so that the speaker can hear you.
65680	71280	So let's give him a round of applause and let the speaker begin.
71280	73280	Please remember to turn on your microphones.
79920	84560	If we have any questions, can we interrupt you, Dr. Chung-Ren?
84720	86720	Sure, no problem.
86720	90720	I didn't prepare a good presentation today, so there might be some points that are not clear.
90720	92720	You are welcome to interrupt.
92720	95760	Okay, let's give Dr. Chung-Ren the microphone.
97520	102400	Okay, first of all, thank you for the introduction.
102400	104400	We have known each other for about a year, right?
104400	106400	I think so. I've been a bit lazy lately.
106400	112400	So what I'm going to talk about today is the metallurgy of quasicrystals.
112480	128400	As you all know, in 2011, Dr. Dan Shepman discovered that he had won the Nobel Prize for violating the principles of traditional quasicrystals.
128400	136400	So today I'm going to focus on the difference between quasicrystals and ordinary crystals.
136400	140400	And why they are called the third state of solid matter.
140400	142400	First of all, this is the first picture.
142400	144400	As you can see, it's actually not a flower.
144400	154400	When Dr. Dan Shepman discovered quasicrystals, he was in a quickly solidified aluminum alloy.
154400	158400	But this thing was actually a big challenge at the time.
158400	162400	Because this thing is not a stable quasicrystal.
162400	168400	So this flower is what happens when it produces quasicrystals.
168400	172400	At a low temperature, it will suck out a second phase.
172400	178400	At that time, Linus Pauling also challenged Dr. Dan Shepman because of this.
178400	182400	He said that there is no quasicrystals in this world, only Poseidon.
182400	186400	So you can see that this is actually the original picture.
186400	188400	This is a picture taken by a general SEM.
188400	190400	And then it became like this after mapping.
190400	194400	The reason why quasicrystals attract me so much is because it is really beautiful.
196400	204400	As I just said, when Dan Shepman discovered quasicrystals, he was actually an Italian.
204400	210400	He found that quasicrystals were actually discovered when he was doing sabbatical at NIST.
210400	212400	In fact, he was very excited when he found this thing.
212400	216400	Why does this kind of quasicrystals appear symmetrically?
216400	220400	You can see this picture below.
220400	232400	Someone used the aluminum-palladium-manganese alloy to make a STM picture of potential energy.
232400	234400	We can see that it is really beautiful.
234400	238400	And then you can see this pentagonal thing everywhere.
238400	242400	This is when Dan Shepman was analyzing the structure of quasicrystals.
242400	248400	He is a very famous thermo-mechanical master at NIST Sabbatical and John Kahn.
248400	254400	But in fact, why can quasicrystals win the Nobel Prize?
254400	256400	I really want to commemorate my boss.
256400	264400	Unfortunately, he did not participate in our quasicrystals seminar this year because he was not in good health.
264400	266400	He died instantly when he was on a business trip to Taiwan.
266400	282400	Mr. Kahn's two most important contributions to quasicrystals were that he synthesized a thermo-mechanical stable quasicrystals in 1987.
282400	290400	The synthesis of this thing led to the continued development of quasicrystals that have been around for more than 30 years.
290400	296400	His second most important contribution was that he successfully produced a two-dimensional crystallography in 2000.
296400	300400	What is so special about this two-dimensional crystallography?
300400	304400	It can replace a lot of atoms in real space.
304400	310400	This allows them to better observe the structure of the crystallography and make a more detailed real-space analysis.
310400	316400	We actually have a workshop in Japan for quasicrystals.
317400	322400	Everyone calls Mr. Kahn a god's hand.
322400	332400	Because many stable quasicrystals have been synthesized by Mr. Kahn according to the rules of his doctoral class.
333400	351400	Mr. Kahn's most important contribution was that he successfully analyzed 12 kinds of quasicrystals related to the 5-axis 20-dimensional system when he was an assistant professor in Northeast Asia.
351400	357400	This is my outline today. I will briefly introduce what quasicrystals are and what quasicrystals are.
357400	362400	How are quasicrystals discovered? Why are they quasicrystals? How do we define quasicrystals?
362400	368400	Why can quasicrystals be stable? I will also briefly introduce the nature and current development of quasicrystals.
368400	373400	I hope that today's speech will allow more people to join the research field of quasicrystals.
373400	378400	I think it's beautiful, but many people may find it useless.
379400	381400	First, let's talk about quasicrystals.
381400	383400	Actually, I want to skip this part.
383400	390400	Because I think everyone should have a basic common sense that quasicrystals must comply with Bragg's Law in quantum mechanics.
390400	396400	But when we look at the electromagnetic microscope, there are two electromagnetic microscopes here.
396400	398400	I'm so bad at talking like this.
398400	405400	Anyway, in the case of 200kV, the lambda is very, very small.
405400	407400	Then we can see...
407400	410400	Oh, it's broken.
410400	414400	Then we usually have an input wave here when we are radiating.
414400	420400	It can be an electromagnetic wave, an X-ray, a medium-wave, a sum-house, anything.
420400	425400	When we are radiating, it must be in line with the number of lambda.
425400	430400	This is a very basic high school physics.
430400	435400	But when we are radiating with an electromagnetic microscope, the input angle is very, very small.
435400	438400	And at this time, it will produce a sphere.
438400	443400	Because the radius of this sphere is very, very large, it can be regarded as a plane.
443400	446400	So we can project its wave onto a plane.
446400	457400	When its lambda value is less than d, sinθ can be close to c.
457400	464400	This is the low value when we are at the bottom.
464400	468400	This is a wave length of electromagnetic when we are at 200kV.
468400	476400	This sinθ angle can be regarded as a distance from this origin to any location.
476400	481400	According to this relationship, we call this thing the Euclidean space.
481400	483400	Why is it called the Euclidean space?
483400	484400	It is a completely opposite space.
484400	489400	If the radius of these two planes is d, there will be a d star here.
489400	494400	If we define this position, this big d is equal to 2π.
494400	497400	There is a big d star here, which is in this position.
497400	503400	It's obviously longer, but it's a little bit farther away.
503400	504400	That's about it.
506400	509400	Next is the difference between crystal and non-crystal.
509400	514400	This should be the non-crystalline matter at the beginning of the definition.
516400	517400	The crystal is obvious.
517400	522400	When we know its position, it has some very standard surfaces.
522400	524400	But in the crystal, we see that it is completely messy.
524400	527400	It may have an average spread.
529400	531400	When we sum up the definition of Bragg,
531400	535400	we can get a crystal with a very obvious spot.
535400	537400	We call it the color spot.
537400	539400	But in the case of amorphous,
539400	540400	in the case of non-crystalline,
540400	543400	it may show some ring-shaped spots.
547400	548400	Next is,
549400	551400	if we list different atoms,
551400	555400	what should it look like in the Euclidean space?
557400	559400	We see that no matter where it is cut,
559400	563400	its position is the same width.
563400	564400	When we surround it,
564400	568400	we may find that the arrangement of the crystal
568400	574400	is very similar to that of the electron-surrounding group.
574400	575400	But here,
575400	578400	the above picture is a square.
578400	580400	You may not see any difference here.
580400	581400	It's all very obvious,
581400	583400	almost the same geometric shape.
583400	585400	But at the bottom,
585400	586400	you will see that
586400	590400	this is the arrangement of the crystal.
590400	594400	Here, it's a hexagonal arrangement like this.
594400	597400	But here, it turns 90 degrees.
597400	600400	This is related to how to build a Euclidean space.
600400	602400	I don't want to talk about it today.
602400	604400	The most important thing is to talk about
604400	608400	the periodicity of the arrangement of atoms.
609400	610400	We can find a unit
610400	612400	that can exist at the same time
612400	617400	in its electron-surrounding group.
618400	620400	If we want to meet this condition,
620400	623400	there are two more important features.
624400	626400	I forgot this thing.
626400	629400	Anyway, we will find the same geometric shape
629400	633400	in the Euclidean space as in the Euclidean space.
635400	637400	In the crystal,
637400	639400	when we know an atom,
639400	640400	as I just mentioned,
640400	642400	when we know where an atom is,
642400	644400	we can infinitely deduce
644400	646400	where the atom exists.
646400	648400	Because the periodicity of each place is the same.
648400	649400	I drew a line.
649400	652400	I can continue to extend it.
654400	655400	Of course, these constraints
655400	657400	and geometric shapes are imagined
657400	659400	to make it easier for us to identify some things.
660400	662400	Then it will slowly extend, extend, extend, extend.
662400	663400	In other words,
663400	664400	knowing a place,
664400	666400	we can know all the places.
667400	668400	We can describe
668400	670400	all the positions in the actual space.
673400	674400	The second is
674400	676400	that if we only use one unit
676400	677400	to fill it,
677400	679400	like this place is square,
679400	681400	it must meet this.
683400	684400	I turned 90 degrees,
684400	685400	turned 90 degrees,
685400	686400	turned 90 degrees,
686400	687400	it's still the same.
687400	689400	It may not be so clear here,
689400	692400	so I open another one.
693400	694400	Can you see it?
697400	698400	OK? OK.
701400	702400	Suppose we turn now
702400	703400	to this triple axis.
703400	705400	This is a cubic structure.
705400	706400	This is a cubic structure.
706400	708400	This is a L1-2 face structure.
709400	711400	Then we turn it to the triple axis.
711400	713400	We find that the light color is at the bottom,
713400	714400	and the dark color is at the top.
714400	715400	Can you tell?
716400	717400	This color is yellow.
717400	719400	No, light blue.
719400	720400	Lighter.
724400	726400	Then we follow it at this time.
727400	728400	This should be the triple axis.
728400	729400	So when we turn 60 degrees,
729400	730400	we will find
733400	734400	pay attention to this position.
735400	738400	It will be light, dark, light, dark, light.
740400	742400	When we turn 120 degrees,
744400	747400	it will be the same color moving.
748400	750400	This is a symmetrical relationship.
752400	753400	It's the same when we turn to the double axis.
753400	755400	If we turn to the double axis,
758400	760400	we use 120 degrees to turn it.
762400	763400	It's a mess.
765400	766400	Use 90 degrees to turn it.
768400	769400	It will run back and forth.
770400	771400	This is a state
772400	773400	that we have to find that it meets
774400	776400	the whole symmetrical axis.
782400	783400	So if we can only use
784400	785400	one shape to arrange,
785400	786400	we can see
787400	788400	that if we only consider
788400	790400	each unit is square,
790400	791400	or we consider a rectangle,
791400	792400	or we consider a rectangle,
792400	793400	these things can be arranged
793400	795400	into quadruple and quadruple.
795400	798400	If we consider a triangle,
798400	799400	you will find that
799400	801400	we can easily use one shape
801400	803400	or a hexagon like this,
803400	804400	we can fill the whole surface.
806400	807400	What about octagon?
807400	809400	Octagon is very similar to quadruple.
811400	812400	I forgot to draw here today.
814400	816400	If we try to connect here,
821400	823400	if we try to connect here,
824400	825400	this position,
826400	827400	this position,
827400	828400	this position,
828400	829400	this position,
829400	830400	when the line comes out,
830400	831400	the line comes out,
831400	832400	its point is different.
833400	834400	Its point is different.
836400	837400	It doesn't meet the so-called
837400	838400	symmetrical axis.
840400	841400	What about pentagon?
842400	843400	When the pentagon comes out,
843400	844400	it can't be arranged
844400	847400	with a single shape.
848400	849400	If you are sensitive to shape,
849400	850400	you may find that
850400	851400	in this place,
851400	852400	the so-called naked places,
852400	853400	we can actually
853400	855400	split it into other shapes
855400	856400	to describe it.
856400	857400	I will continue to talk about it later.
857400	858400	That is to say,
859400	860400	in traditional polygons,
860400	863400	in various different polygons,
865400	866400	it seems to have many possibilities,
866400	867400	but in fact,
867400	868400	in addition to the general
868400	870400	two-axis, three-axis, four-axis, six-axis,
870400	872400	we can't just use one unit
872400	876400	to fill the whole plane.
876400	878400	So the so-called 5, 8, 10, 12
878400	879400	seems to be symmetrical,
879400	880400	but in fact,
880400	881400	it does not meet
881400	882400	the conventional theorem of
882400	883400	traditional algebra.
885400	886400	So,
887400	889400	to sum up,
891400	892400	according to the theory of the line of the pentagon,
892400	894400	the so-called conventional pentagon
894400	896400	must have one-dimensional symmetry.
896400	897400	That is,
897400	898400	we know the position of an element,
898400	899400	we can easily use
899400	901400	a multiplication method
901400	903400	to describe the position of all elements.
903400	904400	That is to say,
904400	906400	if its D space is 1,
906400	907400	I may be 1D, 2D,
907400	909400	3D, 4D, 5D, 6D,
909400	910400	and so on,
910400	912400	to find the corresponding element.
913400	914400	What is the second one?
914400	916400	It only accepts
916400	920400	the rotation operation of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 layers.
922400	923400	Okay,
923400	924400	then we come to
924400	925400	the concatenation.
925400	926400	In fact, the concatenation
926400	928400	was not proposed
928400	930400	by Dan Shetman
930400	931400	at the beginning.
932400	933400	The concatenation word
933400	934400	is just a
936400	937400	long and interesting thing.
937400	938400	However,
938400	939400	he just said
939400	940400	why there is a
940400	941400	completely
941400	942400	against
942400	943400	the concatenation of a
943400	944400	symmetrical existence.
944400	946400	As I just mentioned,
946400	947400	if we can
948400	949400	find a
949400	950400	congruent graph
950400	951400	in the
951400	952400	electromagnetic graph,
952400	953400	then we can
954400	956400	connect in the actual space
956400	958400	to find a
958400	959400	arrangement
959400	960400	with the same
960400	962400	geometry.
962400	963400	But this thing
963400	965400	doesn't seem to be able to
965400	966400	completely fill
966400	967400	the whole plane.
969400	970400	So isn't it
970400	971400	congruent?
971400	972400	But as we just mentioned,
972400	973400	if
973400	975400	the color spots are shown,
976400	977400	when these color spots are shown,
977400	979400	it seems to have to be congruent.
979400	981400	So what the hell happened?
983400	984400	Okay,
984400	985400	this is a
985400	986400	electromagnetic graph
986400	987400	made by Dan Shetman.
987400	988400	We use
988400	989400	a very traditional
989400	990400	algebraic way
990400	991400	to make it
991400	992400	according to its rotation angle
992400	994400	to find all of its
995400	997400	symmetrical
997400	998400	directions.
998400	999400	And finally,
999400	1000400	it's possible that
1000400	1001400	this is
1001400	1002400	a form of
1002400	1003400	icosahedron.
1003400	1004400	This thing
1004400	1005400	has six pentagons,
1005400	1006400	ten triangles,
1006400	1007400	and fifteen
1007400	1008400	quadrangles.
1008400	1009400	The position of the quadrangles
1009400	1010400	is in this position.
1010400	1011400	We can see
1011400	1012400	the zero position.
1013400	1014400	The triangle is
1014400	1015400	obviously the
1015400	1016400	position of this triangle.
1016400	1017400	This is the position
1017400	1018400	corresponding to
1018400	1019400	this triangle.
1019400	1021400	The pentagon is
1021400	1022400	the vertical
1022400	1023400	from this point.
1024400	1025400	Here are five
1025400	1026400	triangles
1026400	1027400	combined into this position.
1030400	1031400	Okay,
1031400	1032400	this thing is
1032400	1033400	very interesting.
1033400	1034400	So,
1035400	1036400	in fact,
1036400	1038400	in 1976,
1038400	1039400	Penrose,
1039400	1040400	a very famous
1040400	1041400	teacher,
1041400	1042400	was thinking
1042400	1043400	how to use
1043400	1044400	the smallest set
1044400	1045400	to lay out
1045400	1046400	all the plane
1046400	1047400	or how we
1047400	1048400	can arrange
1048400	1049400	all the polynomials
1049400	1050400	into a plane.
1051400	1052400	This is
1052400	1053400	one of the
1053400	1054400	patterns of
1054400	1055400	Penrose.
1055400	1056400	In fact,
1056400	1057400	Penrose patterns
1057400	1058400	have many
1058400	1059400	different forms.
1059400	1060400	Finally,
1060400	1061400	this thing
1061400	1062400	is the most
1062400	1063400	similar to
1063400	1064400	quadrangles.
1066400	1067400	McKay
1067400	1068400	also contributed
1068400	1069400	to quadrangles
1069400	1070400	very well.
1070400	1071400	He was doing this
1071400	1072400	at the beginning.
1072400	1073400	This is using
1073400	1074400	Fourier transform
1074400	1075400	to transform
1075400	1076400	from
1076400	1077400	one of
1077400	1078400	Penrose patterns
1078400	1079400	to another.
1080400	1081400	If we go back
1081400	1082400	and see,
1083400	1084400	it's a little bit
1084400	1085400	similar to this pattern.
1086400	1087400	In fact,
1087400	1088400	they knew each other
1088400	1089400	at that time.
1089400	1090400	But
1090400	1091400	they didn't know
1091400	1092400	each other.
1092400	1093400	So,
1093400	1094400	no one could
1094400	1095400	use a reasonable
1095400	1096400	mathematical model
1096400	1097400	to describe
1097400	1098400	what exactly
1098400	1099400	Penrose's
1099400	1100400	tiling looks like.
1100400	1101400	Is this
1101400	1102400	the way
1102400	1103400	to arrange the atoms?
1105400	1106400	Then,
1106400	1107400	later,
1107400	1108400	at that time,
1108400	1110400	Paul Steinhardt
1110400	1111400	was
1111400	1112400	actually
1112400	1113400	he kept
1113400	1114400	claiming that
1114400	1115400	he thought
1115400	1116400	it was the tiling he found.
1116400	1117400	In fact,
1117400	1118400	the term tiling
1118400	1119400	was also defined by him.
1119400	1120400	At that time,
1120400	1121400	he was also inspired
1121400	1122400	by Penrose patterns.
1122400	1123400	There has always been a theory.
1123400	1124400	But
1124400	1125400	until 1984,
1125400	1126400	there was no
1126400	1127400	material coming out,
1127400	1128400	so he didn't publish it.
1128400	1129400	In fact,
1129400	1130400	when he published
1130400	1131400	this article,
1131400	1132400	it was only a little bit
1132400	1133400	later than
1133400	1134400	Dan Shatman.
1134400	1135400	As soon as he published it,
1135400	1136400	he sorted out
1136400	1137400	this article
1137400	1138400	and threw it out.
1138400	1139400	Pay attention to
1139400	1140400	the pattern
1140400	1141400	of this pattern
1141400	1142400	in this article.
1142400	1143400	This is from Dan Shatman.
1143400	1144400	This is from Dan Shatman.
1144400	1145400	This is a pattern
1145400	1146400	in the fast-acting
1146400	1147400	aluminum alloy
1147400	1148400	in Dan Shatman's
1148400	1149400	article.
1149400	1150400	This is very similar.
1150400	1151400	Later,
1151400	1152400	Steinhardt
1152400	1153400	did not publish
1153400	1154400	this article
1154400	1155400	because
1155400	1156400	he thought
1156400	1157400	it was the tiling
1157400	1158400	he found.
1158400	1159400	This is
1159400	1160400	the pattern
1160400	1161400	in the
1161400	1162400	fast-acting
1162400	1163400	aluminum alloy.
1163400	1164400	The pattern
1164400	1165400	is very similar
1165400	1166400	to the pattern
1166400	1167400	in the
1167400	1168400	fast-acting
1168400	1169400	aluminum alloy.
1169400	1170400	Dan Shatman
1170400	1171400	did several
1171400	1172400	experiments on this
1172400	1173400	and tried to observe
1173400	1174400	these things.
1174400	1175400	He did a very
1175400	1176400	beautiful paper
1176400	1177400	on the mathematical
1177400	1178400	model and
1178400	1179400	this thing.
1179400	1180400	From the theoretical
1180400	1181400	calculation
1181400	1182400	to the actual
1182400	1183400	arrangement,
1183400	1184400	he did
1184400	1185400	everything
1185400	1186400	he could
1186400	1187400	in the
1187400	1188400	experiment.
1188400	1189400	But
1189400	1190400	at that time,
1190400	1191400	there was no way
1191400	1192400	to see
1192400	1193400	where the
1193400	1194400	original value
1194400	1195400	was.
1195400	1196400	So at that time,
1196400	1197400	most people
1197400	1198400	used the
1198400	1199400	mathematical model
1199400	1200400	to see
1200400	1201400	what the
1201400	1202400	actual situation
1202400	1203400	was.
1203400	1204400	But this article
1204400	1205400	is really
1205400	1206400	beautiful.
1206400	1207400	If you are
1207400	1208400	interested in
1208400	1209400	this kind of
1209400	1210400	calculation,
1210400	1211400	you can
1211400	1212400	take a look.
1222400	1223400	But
1223400	1224400	before that,
1224400	1225400	although
1225400	1226400	many people
1226400	1227400	made very
1227400	1228400	difficult
1228400	1229400	calculations
1229400	1230400	and
1230400	1231400	very good
1231400	1232400	electromagnetic
1232400	1233400	graph,
1233400	1234400	many people
1234400	1235400	did not
1235400	1236400	believe in
1236400	1237400	this thing.
1237400	1238400	Why?
1238400	1239400	Because
1239400	1240400	people thought
1240400	1241400	they could
1241400	1242400	not see
1242400	1243400	the real
1243400	1244400	thing.
1244400	1245400	Because
1245400	1246400	at that time,
1246400	1247400	it was
1247400	1248400	only possible
1248400	1249400	to make
1249400	1250400	this kind
1250400	1251400	of crystal
1251400	1252400	structure
1252400	1253400	in a
1253400	1254400	fast
1254400	1255400	way.
1255400	1256400	Like
1256400	1257400	you can
1257400	1258400	rotate 36 degrees
1258400	1259400	to form
1259400	1260400	a small
1260400	1261400	group
1261400	1262400	and then
1262400	1263400	it becomes
1263400	1264400	a state
1264400	1265400	that is
1265400	1266400	symmetrical.
1266400	1267400	Can you
1267400	1268400	see
1268400	1269400	that
1269400	1270400	one
1270400	1271400	on my
1271400	1272400	side?
1272400	1273400	Can you see
1273400	1274400	it?
1274400	1275400	Can you
1275400	1276400	see
1276400	1277400	it?
1277400	1278400	Can you
1278400	1279400	see
1279400	1280400	it?
1280400	1281400	Can you
1281400	1282400	see
1282400	1283400	it?
1283400	1284400	Can you
1284400	1285400	see
1285400	1286400	it?
1286400	1287400	Let me
1287400	1288400	mate it.
1288400	1290400	I don't think it's too clear.
1294400	1295400	Let's see.
1295400	1296400	Mating.
1296400	1297400	Mating.
1297400	1298400	Lag.
1302400	1303400	You see
1303400	1304400	it.
1304400	1305400	Ah!
1309400	1310400	This is
1310400	1311400	if we look
1311400	1312400	at this place
1312400	1313400	.
1313400	1314400	This is
1314400	1315400	this is a direction
1317400	1318400	of the pentagon.
1319400	1320400	It is
1320400	1321400	along this thing
1321400	1322400	like this.
1322400	1323400	Hey.
1323400	1324400	Up five, down five.
1325400	1326400	There is a positive five here.
1326400	1327400	There is a negative five here.
1328400	1329400	Then you
1329400	1330400	I'm sorry to let you imagine.
1330400	1331400	Just look at it from here.
1331400	1332400	You will see
1332400	1333400	there are ten things.
1333400	1334400	At that time, he felt
1334400	1335400	that he was
1335400	1336400	like this.
1336400	1337400	A rotating
1337400	1338400	twin like this.
1341400	1342400	Um.
1344400	1345400	OK.
1359400	1360400	Then at that time
1361400	1362400	until 1987
1362400	1363400	Professor Tsai An-pong
1363400	1364400	he was
1364400	1365400	uh
1365400	1366400	he was originally
1366400	1367400	made of non-metallic alloy
1367400	1368400	and then made a picture
1368400	1369400	Oh!
1369400	1370400	It seems
1370400	1371400	to look like gold.
1371400	1372400	He started
1372400	1373400	to think it was interesting
1373400	1374400	because he thought it was beautiful.
1374400	1375400	Why
1375400	1376400	can you make so many spots?
1376400	1377400	He saw a lot of points
1377400	1378400	and he was very happy.
1379400	1380400	Then he started to make gold.
1382400	1383400	Then at the beginning
1383400	1384400	in fact, this alloy
1384400	1385400	this thing
1385400	1386400	he was very early
1386400	1387400	very early
1387400	1388400	very early
1388400	1389400	in the 1930s
1389400	1390400	there was already an image.
1390400	1391400	He was in a very quiet area.
1391400	1392400	He did not
1392400	1393400	he wrote a question mark.
1393400	1394400	Then he
1394400	1395400	just tried it at that time.
1395400	1396400	Just go around there
1396400	1397400	and do it
1397400	1398400	do it
1398400	1399400	do it
1399400	1400400	do it
1400400	1401400	do it
1401400	1402400	do it
1402400	1403400	Then he thought
1403400	1404400	what is it?
1404400	1405400	Just
1405400	1406400	Oh!
1406400	1407400	It's done.
1407400	1408400	Then heat treatment
1408400	1409400	He started to do
1409400	1410400	quench
1410400	1411400	is to do
1411400	1412400	fast cooling
1412400	1413400	and then
1413400	1414400	do the general
1414400	1415400	alloy
1415400	1416400	and then
1416400	1417400	found that after the heat treatment
1417400	1418400	Hey!
1418400	1419400	He is the same thing.
1419400	1420400	So
1420400	1421400	at that time
1421400	1422400	it was called
1422400	1423400	heat-stable
1423400	1424400	heat-stable crystal.
1424400	1425400	Then we can see
1425400	1426400	here
1426400	1427400	he has a very beautiful
1427400	1428400	Dodecahedron
1428400	1429400	a shape
1429400	1430400	This is
1430400	1431400	one of them
1431400	1432400	Dodecahedron
1433400	1434400	Then here we will see
1434400	1435400	Generally in the index
1435400	1436400	When quenching
1436400	1437400	We will use
1437400	1438400	six indexes
1438400	1439400	This is what I just said
1439400	1440400	Because quenching itself
1440400	1441400	has no cycle
1441400	1442400	So we have to
1442400	1443400	project it to the end
1443400	1444400	Do
1444400	1445400	After using two indexes to describe it
1445400	1446400	Go again
1446400	1447400	Write it out
1451400	1452400	So here we are
1452400	1453400	We will know
1453400	1454400	The definition of quenching
1454400	1455400	There will be a few conditions
1455400	1457400	It must have
1457400	1458400	Traditional quenching
1458400	1460400	non-existent
1460400	1461400	The first is
1461400	1462400	The rotation property of the crystal
1462400	1463400	Then the second is
1463400	1465400	It must be
1466400	1467400	Have a
1467400	1468400	Quasi-periodic
1468400	1469400	Ordered
1469400	1470400	This thing
1470400	1471400	Because it has a
1471400	1472400	Very sharp
1472400	1473400	Diffraction spots
1474400	1475400	Then we describe
1475400	1476400	When this quenching
1476400	1477400	We will at least
1477400	1478400	Need to use
1478400	1480400	Three axis of導之空間
1480400	1481400	To describe it
1482400	1483400	That
1483400	1484400	The more interesting thing is
1484400	1485400	In fact, if
1485400	1486400	Uh
1486400	1487400	For
1487400	1488400	The golden ratio is very interesting
1488400	1489400	This tau is the golden ratio
1489400	1490400	Actually
1490400	1491400	Uh
1491400	1492400	The pentagon
1492400	1493400	This
1493400	1494400	When it cuts
1494400	1495400	We go to find it
1495400	1496400	Some nodes
1496400	1497400	Go to both sides
1497400	1498400	When doing a subtraction
1498400	1499400	Will get a golden ratio
1499400	1500400	This is the thing
1500400	1501400	That's why
1501400	1502400	Quenching
1502400	1503400	Will be like this in the array
1504400	1505400	That
1505400	1506400	I seem to have a structure later
1506400	1508400	I'll talk about it in detail
1508400	1509400	Why is it like this
1510400	1511400	Okay, everyone will be curious
1511400	1512400	Quenching in actual space
1512400	1513400	What will it be like
1513400	1514400	In fact
1514400	1515400	If we look at it from the second dimension
1515400	1516400	Its array is a
1516400	1517400	Just
1517400	1518400	This penrose
1518400	1519400	This penrose pattern
1519400	1520400	This is in
1520400	1521400	Uh
1521400	1522400	The two-dimensional state in space
1523400	1524400	What about the three-dimensional state
1524400	1525400	That's what I just said
1525400	1526400	In fact, we use it more often
1526400	1527400	Is this
1527400	1528400	Icosahedron
1528400	1529400	In fact, so far
1529400	1530400	The development of quenching
1530400	1531400	There are already various
1531400	1532400	Different clusters
1532400	1533400	Various different forms
1533400	1534400	Even
1534400	1535400	Actually
1535400	1536400	Linus Pauling
1536400	1537400	Although the quenching
1537400	1538400	Is not a
1538400	1539400	The real
1539400	1540400	Material state
1542400	1543400	But its drive also tells
1543400	1544400	Uh
1544400	1545400	Another thing that comes out
1545400	1546400	Is the so-called
1547400	1548400	Quenching crystal
1550400	1551400	Everyone take a look
1551400	1552400	Can you see it?
1557400	1558400	Take a look
1562400	1563400	These two things we can see
1563400	1564400	Top
1564400	1566400	Let me compare the top ball
1568400	1569400	This one
1569400	1570400	Yes yes yes
1570400	1571400	The big red cluster
1572400	1573400	These two things
1573400	1574400	It's actually the same thing
1574400	1575400	But
1575400	1576400	If you are in the case of quenching
1576400	1577400	It will be like this
1577400	1578400	Keep connecting
1578400	1579400	Keep connecting
1579400	1580400	That may be less connected here
1580400	1582400	Only three and a half units are connected here
1583400	1584400	When you keep extending
1584400	1585400	You will see different situations
1585400	1587400	If you are interested, you can come and visit
1587400	1588400	We are
1588400	1589400	On the platform
1590400	1591400	Then the other one is
1591400	1592400	Pauling
1592400	1593400	Pauling
1593400	1594400	At that time
1594400	1595400	To quench
1595400	1596400	He just thinks
1597400	1598400	This is actually just a kind of
1598400	1599400	Uh
1599400	1600400	In the cubic
1600400	1601400	A double crystal structure
1601400	1602400	So your
1602400	1603400	Uh
1603400	1604400	Quenching crystal
1604400	1605400	It will
1605400	1606400	Uh
1606400	1607400	It may exist in a certain position in its corner
1607400	1608400	Then continue to combine
1608400	1609400	Combine
1609400	1610400	That
1610400	1611400	This is actually
1611400	1612400	We later
1612400	1613400	It is a kind of
1613400	1614400	Uh
1614400	1616400	We call 110 quenching crystal
1616400	1617400	Or 11 quenching crystal
1617400	1618400	Or
1618400	1619400	Uh
1619400	1620400	32 quenching
1620400	1621400	21 quenching crystal
1621400	1622400	Or 32 quenching crystal
1622400	1623400	That
1623400	1624400	This is in the case of high-dimensional projection
1624400	1625400	His
1626400	1628400	Long-edged brush and short-edged brush
1628400	1629400	A
1629400	1630400	Convex state
1630400	1631400	Then there is
1634400	1635400	Uh
1635400	1636400	It is
1636400	1637400	A
1637400	1638400	Convex
1638400	1639400	Convex
1639400	1640400	Convex
1640400	1641400	Convex
1641400	1642400	Convex
1642400	1643400	Then there is another state
1643400	1644400	Is
1644400	1645400	Purely 10-axis symmetrical
1645400	1646400	This thing
1646400	1647400	We call
1647400	1648400	Uh
1648400	1649400	Delta
1649400	1650400	Um
1650400	1651400	Decagonal type
1651400	1652400	That
1652400	1653400	This thing will appear in
1653400	1655400	Also appear in the aluminum convex crystal
1655400	1656400	That
1656400	1657400	This thing
1657400	1659400	It will have a very strong
1659400	1660400	Impression
1660400	1661400	Because
1661400	1662400	We are from this
1662400	1663400	If our
1664400	1665400	It will actually have a lot of
1665400	1666400	Phonon drag
1666400	1667400	With some
1667400	1668400	Radiation
1668400	1669400	Because it has more
1669400	1670400	Phason
1670400	1671400	Ah
1671400	1672400	Phason can actually be understood as
1672400	1673400	Uh
1673400	1674400	A defect in the convex
1674400	1675400	Or dislocation
1675400	1676400	The part
1676400	1677400	Then it is here
1677400	1678400	It is a very symmetrical
1678400	1679400	A symmetrical structure
1679400	1680400	Uh
1680400	1681400	So his side
1681400	1682400	Um
1682400	1683400	That kind of radiation
1683400	1684400	What
1684400	1685400	Isolation rate
1685400	1686400	Will be
1686400	1687400	In
1687400	1688400	Vertical
1688400	1689400	That
1689400	1690400	Very, very much
1690400	1691400	Um
1692400	1693400	That
1693400	1694400	This stable
1694400	1695400	Stable convex crystal in thermodynamics
1695400	1696400	Just for
1696400	1697400	Our
1697400	1698400	This
1699400	1700400	The crystal brings a new definition
1700400	1701400	Because in the past
1701400	1702400	What I just said
1702400	1703400	The definition of the so-called convex crystal is
1703400	1704400	Uh
1706400	1707400	In a solid
1707400	1708400	Its atoms are all
1708400	1709400	Have a
1709400	1710400	Stable
1710400	1711400	Line
1711400	1712400	And it can be
1712400	1713400	Flat
1713400	1714400	And it has a certain
1714400	1715400	Rotational properties
1715400	1716400	That
1716400	1717400	What is the new definition
1717400	1718400	Is
1718400	1719400	We can all
1719400	1720400	In
1720400	1721400	That
1721400	1722400	Causing the space to find
1722400	1723400	Any symmetry
1723400	1724400	When
1724400	1725400	We will call it
1725400	1726400	Is a kind of convex
1726400	1727400	That this
1727400	1728400	This is a new view of matter
1728400	1729400	Ok
1729400	1730400	Then I will now cut into
1730400	1731400	The part of the eye is
1731400	1732400	Uh
1732400	1733400	Stability of the convex crystal
1733400	1734400	In fact, this is
1734400	1735400	At the beginning
1735400	1736400	Mr. Tsai is doing this
1736400	1737400	He also said
1737400	1738400	He just wanted to say
1738400	1739400	Ah
1739400	1740400	Why can I make aluminum copper iron
1740400	1741400	Ah
1741400	1742400	Other
1742400	1743400	Is there any other way
1743400	1744400	Can
1744400	1745400	Uh
1745400	1746400	So
1746400	1747400	This
1747400	1748400	This
1748400	1749400	This
1749400	1750400	You can use this
1750400	1751400	It's all
1751400	1752400	Ah
1776400	1777400	The third is
1777400	1778400	Uh
1778400	1780400	One of the more important points is
1780400	1781400	His
1781400	1783400	Average electronic density
1783400	1784400	That
1784400	1787400	In the aluminum alkyl
1787400	1788400	We have one
1788400	1790400	More common E over A value
1790400	1791400	We call E over A value
1791400	1793400	Called 1.8
1793400	1794400	Then we are in our circle
1794400	1796400	We call magic number
1799400	1801400	Then the second stability factor is
1801400	1803400	We can start with this
1803400	1804400	Average electronic density
1804400	1805400	And our
1805400	1806400	Uh
1807400	1808400	From that
1808400	1810400	In the electromagnetic radiation space
1810400	1811400	See his
1811400	1812400	The amount of G
1812400	1813400	We can assess
1813400	1814400	Say his
1814400	1815400	That
1815400	1816400	Polycarbonate
1816400	1817400	With
1817400	1818400	Phenol
1818400	1819400	Uh, our phenol
1819400	1820400	In fact, it is a
1820400	1821400	Phenol
1821400	1822400	Because in fact, we can't really estimate it
1822400	1824400	We just use a static value
1824400	1825400	Go to him
1825400	1826400	To solve him
1826400	1827400	This thing can be seen
1827400	1828400	He is
1828400	1830400	It has something to do with his E over A
1830400	1831400	Then
1831400	1832400	We can get
1832400	1833400	Such a relationship
1833400	1834400	Then we see
1834400	1835400	Aluminum alkyl
1835400	1836400	Is
1836400	1837400	This is the aluminum alkyl with the transition element
1837400	1838400	Aluminum alkyl
1838400	1840400	He will follow this relationship
1842400	1843400	But in this aluminum alkyl of Cd
1843400	1844400	His
1844400	1846400	E over A is actually equal to 2
1846400	1847400	That
1847400	1848400	This thing
1848400	1849400	He later
1849400	1850400	We have observed that he has a
1850400	1851400	SPD track
1851400	1852400	The effect of miscellaneous
1852400	1854400	Will cause in that
1856400	1858400	Near the aluminum alkyl
1859400	1860400	A widening of the track area
1860400	1861400	Then this
1861400	1862400	So currently actually
1862400	1863400	Aluminum alkyl
1863400	1864400	In this so-called E over A
1865400	1866400	There is no one
1866400	1867400	Better
1867400	1868400	Or more complete
1868400	1869400	Regulation
1869400	1870400	Then this is also one of our
1870400	1871400	Challenge now
1874400	1875400	That
1876400	1877400	But this is a
1877400	1878400	More controversial
1878400	1879400	That is
1879400	1880400	Generally we know that aluminum is
1880400	1881400	Three elements
1881400	1882400	Three elements
1882400	1883400	He wears three
1883400	1884400	The same normal
1884400	1885400	He has an electrolyte
1885400	1886400	Wear one
1886400	1887400	Then why is the iron
1887400	1888400	About negative 2.66
1888400	1889400	This is
1889400	1890400	In the previous
1890400	1891400	Calculated one
1891400	1892400	A
1892400	1893400	The probability of splitting the track
1893400	1894400	A probability
1894400	1896400	Iron in this system
1896400	1897400	He must be in
1897400	1898400	Negative 2.66
1898400	1899400	That this is also a
1899400	1900400	Very interesting place
1900400	1901400	That is
1901400	1902400	How do we use this
1902400	1903400	Full element
1903400	1904400	Go
1904400	1905400	Um
1905400	1906400	Use elements of aluminum alkyl
1906400	1907400	Go
1907400	1908400	Adjust some of his features
1908400	1909400	Is he
1909400	1910400	DS
1910400	1911400	Or his
1911400	1913400	Some of the effects of track miscellaneous
1913400	1916400	That time we went to iron
1917400	1918400	Rutanium
1918400	1919400	Then
1919400	1920400	Oslim
1920400	1921400	Sit down like this
1921400	1922400	Find out
1922400	1923400	They are in the same group
1923400	1924400	Under the circumstances
1924400	1925400	Their outermost
1925400	1926400	Electrolyte state is the same
1926400	1927400	These can be done
1927400	1928400	Very stable nodule
1928400	1929400	Then
1930400	1931400	I made a mistake
1931400	1932400	Ah
1932400	1933400	I put the wrong side
1933400	1934400	This TMG
1934400	1935400	This line
1937400	1938400	I'm sorry
1938400	1939400	That
1939400	1940400	It's about 1.8 here
1940400	1941400	That
1941400	1942400	In this part
1942400	1943400	More people are doing
1943400	1944400	Is
1944400	1945400	Developing towards hot metal
1945400	1946400	Or
1946400	1947400	They go
1947400	1948400	Want to see
1948400	1949400	Inside a cluster
1949400	1950400	If he lacks a
1950400	1951400	Will it lead him to the whole
1951400	1952400	That
1952400	1953400	Metal sword
1953400	1954400	The price
1954400	1955400	Ah
1955400	1956400	A transfer phenomenon
1956400	1957400	At present
1957400	1958400	They use that
1958400	1959400	That
1961400	1962400	The way of man-made engineering
1962400	1963400	In
1963400	1964400	Make this prediction
1964400	1967400	What is the element of half the number
1967400	1968400	Um
1968400	1969400	Some of you
1969400	1970400	Composite
1970400	1971400	What is that
1971400	1972400	Composition
1972400	1973400	What
1973400	1974400	Ah
1974400	1975400	This is actually
1975400	1976400	His
1976400	1977400	It's all 100
1977400	1978400	It's all 100
1978400	1979400	It's all 100
1979400	1980400	This is the original ratio
1980400	1981400	Ah
1981400	1982400	Then we will follow this original ratio
1982400	1983400	Let's say
1983400	1984400	Ah
1984400	1985400	This aluminum is
1985400	1986400	With three additives
1986400	1987400	Multiply by 3
1987400	1988400	Then this is multiplied by 1
1988400	1990400	That 12 is multiplied by 2.66
1990400	1991400	Then finally it is a total of 100
1991400	1992400	Divide by 100
1992400	1993400	We can calculate this
1993400	1994400	A value of 1 over a
1994400	1995400	A value of 1 over a
1997400	1998400	Um
1998400	2000400	That this is currently a
2000400	2001400	A more stable nodule
2001400	2002400	A list
2002400	2003400	If you are interested
2003400	2004400	You can take a look
2004400	2005400	Hey
2005400	2006400	Maybe it's related to your
2006400	2007400	Uh
2007400	2008400	You can take it and do it
2008400	2009400	There are some
2009400	2010400	In the structure
2010400	2011400	Some more
2011400	2012400	Different or special
2012400	2013400	Some things
2013400	2014400	That is actually the easiest now
2014400	2015400	Applied by the business
2015400	2016400	Maybe it's this
2016400	2017400	Aluminum and the transition element
2017400	2018400	This part
2018400	2019400	Because it also contains more
2019400	2020400	The price is cheaper
2020400	2021400	So
2021400	2022400	More suitable for mass production
2022400	2024400	That if it is for
2024400	2025400	Say
2025400	2026400	Do basic research
2026400	2027400	Will be more
2027400	2028400	If you are interested
2028400	2029400	Isn't this guess
2029400	2030400	Teacher Cai
2030400	2031400	Ah
2031400	2032400	That this
2032400	2033400	You can go from here
2033400	2034400	He will
2034400	2035400	Can make
2035400	2036400	More likely to make
2036400	2037400	Two-dimensional nodules
2037400	2038400	This thing
2038400	2039400	Uh
2039400	2040400	On the combination of nodules
2040400	2042400	The concept is a little different
2045400	2046400	Then I will introduce a little bit
2046400	2047400	Nodule
2047400	2048400	It's in
2048400	2049400	It's obviously made of metal
2049400	2050400	That
2050400	2051400	Oh, yeah, from the picture just now
2051400	2052400	You can know
2052400	2053400	Most nodules are made of metal
2053400	2054400	That
2054400	2055400	Let's take a look at it
2055400	2056400	In
2056400	2057400	Different
2057400	2058400	Its hardness and its
2058400	2059400	Uh
2059400	2060400	Um
2060400	2061400	Electrode
2061400	2062400	When it's low temperature
2062400	2063400	Uh
2063400	2064400	In fact
2064400	2065400	Nodule
2065400	2066400	It is a
2066400	2067400	Negative temperature factor
2067400	2068400	It's a negative temperature factor
2068400	2069400	So you see
2069400	2070400	That
2070400	2071400	Iron, aluminum, copper
2071400	2073400	When it's high temperature, the electrons rise
2073400	2075400	It's obviously a combination of aluminum and copper and iron
2075400	2076400	When it's high temperature
2076400	2077400	It's a drop
2077400	2078400	thing
2078400	2079400	So
2079400	2080400	In this place
2080400	2081400	It's on the electromagnetic field
2081400	2082400	It's closer to the semiconductor
2082400	2083400	That
2083400	2084400	It's not that it's all semiconductors
2084400	2086400	We usually call it metal
2086400	2087400	That
2087400	2088400	This thing
2088400	2089400	Its attraction
2089400	2090400	At the moment at high temperature
2090400	2092400	Some people will target its phasing
2092400	2093400	That's what I was talking about
2093400	2094400	That
2094400	2096400	In the so-called full space
2096400	2097400	Some interactions
2097400	2098400	The state
2098400	2099400	They think it's like this
2099400	2101400	There is no better explanation yet
2101400	2102400	Interpretation
2102400	2103400	That
2103400	2104400	If you look at it from the age
2104400	2105400	If you look at it from the age
2105400	2107400	It's got a microscope
2107400	2108400	That
2108400	2109400	Only electrons can see that
2109400	2110400	Microscope
2110400	2112400	It may block some of the effects
2112400	2113400	Or let it jump
2113400	2114400	Um
2114400	2116400	In terms of hardness
2116400	2117400	Uh
2117400	2118400	This is the general
2118400	2119400	Uh
2119400	2120400	Steel is iron
2120400	2122400	Iron alloy
2122400	2123400	Then
2124400	2125400	Their hardness is very, very low
2125400	2127400	It's very, very hard when it's combined
2127400	2128400	Ah
2128400	2130400	If you look at it from the defect
2130400	2132400	You can say that the whole body
2132400	2133400	It's all defects
2133400	2135400	It's very, very hard
2135400	2136400	But on the contrary
2136400	2138400	It's also very, very crisp
2138400	2140400	That
2140400	2142400	This is currently more likely
2142400	2144400	And possible applications
2144400	2146400	In fact, there are quite a few
2146400	2147400	That
2147400	2148400	Because like I said
2148400	2149400	It's very crisp
2149400	2151400	So usually we use the way of the body
2151400	2152400	To do
2152400	2153400	Uh
2153400	2154400	Some crystal products
2154400	2156400	Or by coating
2156400	2158400	Because we want to make the body smaller
2158400	2159400	We can ignore it
2159400	2160400	Some
2160400	2162400	Some harder temperament
2162400	2163400	That
2163400	2164400	Like
2164400	2166400	It's more interesting in this part of the blowing
2166400	2168400	Many people will use this crystal
2168400	2169400	Ah
2169400	2170400	He went to do that
2170400	2172400	Get rid of the aluminum in it
2172400	2174400	That's like copper, iron
2174400	2176400	Copper itself for
2176400	2177400	Uh, carbon dioxide
2177400	2178400	It has the characteristic of blowing
2178400	2180400	Its copper just happens to be on some specific
2180400	2181400	Edge
2181400	2183400	In the corner of the crystal
2183400	2184400	At this time it will
2184400	2186400	Because it has some special
2186400	2187400	Uh
2187400	2188400	Double crystal structure
2188400	2190400	So it has a better impact on the blowing
2190400	2192400	I think this part is more interesting
2192400	2194400	That there is another part
2194400	2195400	In that
2195400	2197400	Metal
2197400	2199400	The part of the metal compound
2199400	2201400	Now the metal compound
2201400	2202400	For the crystal
2202400	2203400	There are mainly two directions
2203400	2204400	One is mainly
2204400	2206400	Put the crystal into
2206400	2207400	Uh
2207400	2208400	Aluminum alloy
2208400	2209400	Lala
2209400	2210400	Boil it up
2210400	2212400	The other way is to use
2212400	2213400	Aluminum alloy
2213400	2215400	After making the aluminum alloy
2215400	2216400	Then suck it out again
2216400	2217400	And then at high temperature
2217400	2218400	Rebound
2218400	2219400	Uh
2219400	2221400	A high intensity effect
2221400	2222400	That crystal
2222400	2223400	Because the surface of the body is very low
2223400	2225400	So it has a very low friction factor
2225400	2226400	Then
2226400	2227400	Also very brittle
2227400	2229400	Then I will show you later
2229400	2230400	Uh, some of the current
2230400	2231400	Crystal products
2231400	2233400	Ah, there seems to be a film
2233400	2234400	Ah
2234400	2235400	Ah
2235400	2237400	Okay, how did the crystal come out?
2237400	2238400	I just talked so much
2238400	2239400	How did the crystal come out?
2239400	2240400	This is a
2240400	2241400	More traditional
2241400	2242400	The production of a crystal
2242400	2243400	Ah
2243400	2244400	A metal
2244400	2245400	The relationship of manufacturing
2245400	2246400	That generally uses
2246400	2247400	Uh
2247400	2248400	Metal steam or metal liquid
2248400	2249400	If you start with metal liquid
2249400	2250400	If you start with metal liquid
2250400	2251400	Very reasonable
2251400	2252400	Uh
2252400	2253400	Very reasonable to understand
2253400	2254400	Is like
2254400	2255400	Casting ah
2255400	2256400	Aluminum alloy ah
2256400	2257400	These methods
2257400	2258400	If we cool down quickly
2258400	2259400	Will get this
2259400	2260400	Aluminum alloy
2260400	2261400	Then we cool down slowly
2261400	2262400	Will get the crystal
2262400	2263400	In fact, thermodynamics
2263400	2264400	Stable crystal
2264400	2265400	In fact, when you cool down slowly
2265400	2267400	It can also get a crystal
2267400	2268400	Then I just talked about
2268400	2270400	Extracted from aluminum alloy
2270400	2271400	Stable crystal
2271400	2273400	It's easy to get out of the treasure box
2273400	2275400	Ah, the alloy of the treasure box
2275400	2276400	Then use the method of actual effect
2276400	2277400	Let it suck it out
2277400	2278400	This is
2278400	2279400	From
2279400	2280400	Uh
2280400	2281400	A part of the crystal to the crystal
2281400	2282400	That
2282400	2283400	From the non-crystal
2283400	2284400	There is also this thing
2284400	2285400	There will also be this thing
2285400	2286400	That is, Mr. Tsai
2286400	2287400	Why did you start
2287400	2288400	A reason for making a stable crystal
2288400	2289400	That
2289400	2290400	Like
2290400	2291400	At present, someone will also use
2291400	2292400	That
2292400	2293400	PVD
2293400	2294400	PVD way to make a stable crystal
2294400	2295400	But
2295400	2296400	Uh
2296400	2297400	In terms of the control of the treasure
2297400	2298400	Or some conditions
2298400	2300400	In fact, to make a very high quality
2300400	2301400	Uh
2301400	2302400	Stable crystal
2302400	2303400	Will be
2303400	2304400	It's still a big challenge
2304400	2305400	That
2305400	2306400	That
2306400	2307400	That
2307400	2308400	This is what I just summarized
2308400	2309400	Uh
2309400	2310400	The so-called processes just now
2310400	2311400	In fact, this side is
2311400	2312400	We are more common
2312400	2313400	Some
2313400	2314400	Some methods of manufacturing stable crystals
2314400	2315400	Including
2315400	2316400	Just the general
2316400	2317400	Traditional casting
2317400	2318400	There is also that
2318400	2319400	High-speed cooling
2319400	2320400	Uh
2320400	2321400	Beat
2321400	2322400	The cooling speed per second
2322400	2323400	It's probably more than 3000 degrees
2323400	2324400	Very fast
2324400	2325400	Then this
2325400	2326400	This is also a very fast
2326400	2327400	Cooling
2327400	2328400	Uh
2328400	2329400	The latter two are relatively rare
2329400	2330400	I just
2330400	2331400	Another one is to use mechanical alloy
2331400	2332400	Is to put a bunch of elements
2332400	2333400	Put it together
2333400	2334400	And then it's high energy
2334400	2335400	Put it together
2335400	2338400	It's like doing high-speed alloy
2338400	2339400	Someone does it
2339400	2340400	And then like that
2340400	2341400	This is the general
2341400	2342400	Uh
2342400	2343400	PVD
2343400	2344400	PVD like this
2344400	2345400	But there is a very important point
2345400	2346400	Is that
2346400	2347400	If it is not processed
2347400	2349400	It's actually very rare
2349400	2350400	Very high quality
2350400	2351400	Very high quality
2351400	2352400	Very high quality
2352400	2353400	Very high quality
2353400	2354400	Unless it is
2354400	2355400	Certain
2355400	2356400	Some very specific stable crystals
2356400	2358400	Can get a better way
2358400	2359400	Uh
2359400	2360400	A better one
2360400	2361400	Uh
2361400	2362400	Structure
2362400	2363400	Structure
2363400	2364400	Structure
2364400	2365400	That
2365400	2366400	Finally, let me introduce
2366400	2367400	We just mentioned so much
2367400	2368400	Uh
2368400	2369400	Uh
2369400	2370400	The crystal will become
2370400	2371400	Uh
2371400	2372400	The crystal can run out of the stable crystal
2372400	2373400	Uh
2373400	2374400	This is a thin one
2374400	2375400	And then
2375400	2376400	Can we
2376400	2377400	Let the crystal
2377400	2378400	Directly become a stable crystal
2378400	2379400	This is our recent
2379400	2380400	A
2380400	2381400	A new discovery is that we can
2381400	2382400	Indeed
2382400	2383400	In a special way
2383400	2384400	In a special way
2384400	2385400	Uh
2385400	2386400	Uh
2386400	2387400	Make the crystal
2387400	2388400	Make the crystal
2388400	2389400	Gradually become a stable crystal
2389400	2390400	Then we get a composite material
2390400	2391400	Then
2391400	2392400	Here is a
2392400	2393400	The one I just saw
2393400	2395400	One of the shapes of the dodecahedron
2395400	2396400	And here
2396400	2397400	The composition may not be very good
2397400	2399400	Just happened to take a pretty picture
2399400	2400400	Just happened to take a pretty picture
2400400	2401400	Ah
2401400	2402400	Ah
2402400	2403400	Next is
2403400	2404400	The one I just mentioned
2404400	2405400	Tolstien Hart
2405400	2406400	He is
2406400	2407400	He thinks
2407400	2409400	Nobel Prize should be given to him
2409400	2410400	Why didn't you give it to him
2410400	2412400	He also wrote a letter to protest
2412400	2413400	Anyway
2413400	2414400	He is still very passionate
2414400	2415400	He is
2416400	2417400	In that
2418400	2420400	In a meteorite pit in Russia
2420400	2422400	Found the so-called natural dodecahedron
2422400	2424400	This is a picture of a high-density
2424400	2426400	You can see a very beautiful one
2426400	2428400	A pattern of a dodecahedron
2428400	2429400	Uh
2429400	2432400	I just talked to Sol
2432400	2433400	He still says
2434400	2435400	We were 45
2435400	2436400	45 years ago
2436400	2438400	You can find the dodecahedron
2438400	2439400	It must be in the universe
2439400	2441400	Tell us what the message is
2441400	2442400	Is it
2442400	2443400	Dodecahedron is a
2443400	2445400	A very common state in the universe
2445400	2446400	But if you finish watching
2446400	2447400	Just introduced the dodecahedron
2447400	2449400	How did it come out
2449400	2451400	You should be able to understand
2451400	2453400	Actually in the process of falling like this in the meteorite pit
2453400	2454400	It's a little bit like
2454400	2455400	After melting quickly
2455400	2456400	Quickly cool
2456400	2458400	That is, it happens to be very likely
2458400	2459400	A substance that will produce this
2459400	2460400	I think it's pretty reasonable
2460400	2461400	But
2461400	2462400	I also think he's right
2462400	2463400	If we can
2463400	2465400	Understand whether the dodecahedron is in the universe
2465400	2466400	Very stable
2466400	2467400	Maybe for the future
2467400	2469400	Application is a great help
2470400	2472400	That may be in recent years
2472400	2473400	In the dodecahedron
2473400	2475400	A part that everyone pays more attention to
2475400	2477400	Mainly in that
2477400	2478400	In the dodecahedron
2478400	2480400	Some of its special physical properties
2480400	2481400	That includes
2481400	2483400	I have found this
2483400	2486400	Eterbium in that
2486400	2487400	Quasi-crystal
2487400	2489400	Uh, in the dodecahedron
2489400	2490400	That one
2490400	2492400	Uh
2492400	2493400	Additive ratio
2493400	2495400	Then another one is
2495400	2496400	Magnetic connection
2496400	2498400	Its magnetic and
2498400	2499400	Magnetic connection
2499400	2500400	It's also found in the dodecahedron
2500400	2502400	And then there's the so-called
2502400	2504400	The superconductive
2504400	2506400	It's usually oxidized dodecahedron
2506400	2507400	Superconductive
2507400	2509400	Then we are in a very low temperature
2509400	2510400	Someone found a simple dodecahedron
2510400	2511400	You can also find this thing
2511400	2512400	Is that in the future we can also start
2512400	2513400	The so-called
2513400	2515400	In their research
2515400	2516400	Use that so-called
2516400	2517400	The dodecahedron and the dodecahedron
2517400	2518400	Comparison together
2518400	2519400	That is a
2519400	2520400	Periodic
2520400	2521400	A comparison of periodicity and periodicity
2521400	2523400	Found this thing
2523400	2524400	That's the last one
2524400	2525400	I just talked about
2525400	2527400	A product of our dodecahedron
2527400	2529400	I'm not sure if I can see it
2529400	2530400	That's the bottom
2530400	2532400	This white part
2532400	2533400	This is what we do
2533400	2534400	A product of dodecahedron
2534400	2536400	That we didn't add any oil
2536400	2538400	I didn't add anything
2538400	2539400	Just put the eggs on top
2539400	2540400	Roasted
2540400	2541400	Look at the top
2541400	2542400	This
2542400	2544400	The part of the oil has been covered
2544400	2546400	But the bottom is completely dry
2548400	2549400	So we are doing dodecahedron now
2549400	2550400	I hope
2550400	2552400	There's no way to make a high-quality dodecahedron
2552400	2554400	And then maybe in the near future
2554400	2556400	Replace the dodecahedron as soon as possible
2556400	2558400	In the entire national market
2558400	2560400	Even in the shipping market
2562400	2564400	This is what I did this year
2564400	2565400	At the European conference
2565400	2567400	We discussed a few questions
2567400	2568400	We are not yet
2568400	2570400	To discuss these things in depth
2570400	2572400	But if you are interested in joining the dodecahedron in the future
2572400	2573400	You can continue to do this
2573400	2574400	Includes
2574400	2576400	How to make a larger
2576400	2578400	A better dodecahedron feed
2578400	2580400	And then do a partial
2580400	2582400	Electronic communication characteristics
2582400	2583400	Exploration
2583400	2584400	Because dodecahedron itself is a
2584400	2586400	A lot of things
2586400	2587400	The other is
2587400	2589400	This is the part that I didn't follow
2589400	2591400	Is it
2591400	2593400	Phenomenon or non-phenomenon
2593400	2595400	There's really a phenomenon
2595400	2596400	So we've been talking about
2596400	2597400	Dodecahedron surface
2597400	2598400	Dodecahedron surface
2598400	2599400	But he really has
2599400	2600400	This is
2600400	2602400	Because we use a lot of dodecahedron models
2602400	2604400	This thing is a
2604400	2605400	In
2605400	2606400	Mathematics may be more
2606400	2607400	Challenging thing
2607400	2608400	The last one is me
2608400	2609400	I always feel like
2609400	2611400	We should go find a
2611400	2613400	New dodecahedron
2613400	2614400	New dodecahedron
2614400	2615400	Because now the dodecahedron is actually
2615400	2616400	Relatively low melting point
2616400	2617400	Since it's so good at high temperature
2617400	2618400	We can't find
2618400	2619400	A higher temperature dodecahedron
2619400	2621400	This thing may be for the future
2621400	2623400	Whether it's on the aircraft
2623400	2624400	Or on the ship
2624400	2626400	Will be better help
2626400	2628400	Then I will make a concluding remark
2628400	2629400	Is
2629400	2632400	Yes, dodecahedron is the third kind of solid matter
2632400	2633400	Then its thermal stability
2633400	2635400	In fact, compared to the general
2635400	2636400	High entropy
2636400	2638400	Alloy or
2638400	2639400	Amorphous
2639400	2641400	It has better thermal stability
2641400	2642400	That
2643400	2644400	Dodecahedron
2644400	2646400	It can be found in many nuclei
2646400	2648400	And even in the universe
2650400	2651400	That
2651400	2652400	The following is
2652400	2653400	In fact, the most important thing is this
2653400	2654400	How are we going to
2654400	2655400	From dodecahedron
2655400	2656400	We can understand
2656400	2658400	What is the definition of a new structure
2658400	2659400	Are we going to define it in three dimensions
2659400	2660400	Or in
2660400	2661400	Causing space to define it
2661400	2662400	Or we can define it in six dimensions
2662400	2664400	This is a very worthwhile question
2664400	2665400	That's the last
2665400	2666400	Thank you for listening
2666400	2668400	Then we can take a look
2668400	2669400	The picture on the right
2669400	2670400	I chose
2670400	2671400	The picture on the left is not very good
2671400	2672400	I picked a little bit
2672400	2673400	In fact, it looks like
2673400	2674400	It looks like a dodecahedron
2674400	2675400	But if we put
2675400	2676400	After all the lines are drawn
2676400	2677400	Will find
2677400	2678400	Hey
2678400	2679400	This thing is what we just saw
2679400	2680400	That penrose pattern
2680400	2681400	Is exactly the same
2681400	2683400	So sometimes our eyes
2683400	2685400	Can't see the real situation
2685400	2686400	But electrons can be our eyes
2686400	2687400	Let us see
2687400	2688400	Hey
2688400	2690400	What does the real atom look like
2690400	2691400	That
2691400	2692400	Today
2692400	2693400	It's almost time
2693400	2694400	Thank you all
2694400	2695400	If you have any questions
2695400	2696400	Welcome to discuss
2701400	2702400	Applause
2702400	2704400	Ok
2704400	2705400	Hello everyone
2705400	2706400	Thank you
2706400	2707400	Hey
2709400	2710400	OK
2710400	2712400	Is there anything you want to ask
2712400	2713400	Any questions
2713400	2714400	For those of you
2718400	2720400	who want to know
2721400	2722400	Hi
2722400	2723400	Just
2723400	2724400	Hello
2724400	2725400	Well
2725400	2726400	I want to know
2726400	2727400	Is that you
2727400	2729400	How do you define
2729400	2731400	Its three-dimensional structure
2731400	2733400	How do you define its
2733400	2734400	Defects
2734400	2735400	For example
2735400	2736400	Dislocation
2736400	2737400	Or stacking fault
2737400	2738400	Or grain boundary
2740400	2741400	Oh
2741400	2742400	This thing
2742400	2743400	Is
2743400	2745400	In fact, we are now
2745400	2747400	I don't know how to discuss
2747400	2748400	Yes
2748400	2749400	But
2749400	2751400	This is the general whole
2751400	2753400	A situation of actual atomic array
2753400	2754400	In fact
2754400	2756400	It is difficult for us to find a complete cut
2756400	2757400	You see, it seems to be flat here
2757400	2758400	It seems to be flat
2759400	2760400	But it's broken
2761400	2762400	So we usually define
2762400	2763400	When it comes to accuracy
2763400	2764400	Let's look at that defect
2764400	2765400	Look at this
2767400	2768400	This two fat
2768400	2769400	One is fat
2770400	2771400	That rhombohedron
2771400	2773400	And the other one is flatter
2773400	2774400	That
2774400	2775400	Hey
2775400	2776400	Can I use the performance
2776400	2777400	No
2777400	2778400	Usually we
2778400	2780400	When it comes to the defect of accuracy
2780400	2782400	It's that the origin is always moving
2782400	2783400	It's always changing
2783400	2784400	But it's always
2784400	2785400	The form of stable accuracy
2785400	2786400	No matter how it alternates
2786400	2787400	It's always
2787400	2789400	A form of stable accuracy
2789400	2792400	I'll give you an example of a cluster
2792400	2793400	It's like
2793400	2795400	It's got a very strong polarity
2795400	2796400	It's a very strong polarity
2796400	2797400	It's a very strong polarity
2797400	2799400	How do we define dislocation
2799400	2800400	It's actually a bit difficult
2800400	2801400	But we can use it
2801400	2802400	If
2802400	2803400	If
2803400	2804400	Hey
2804400	2805400	Today
2805400	2807400	One of the fatter things
2808400	2809400	This
2809400	2810400	This thing
2810400	2813400	It's a relatively big thing
2813400	2814400	If it suddenly
2814400	2816400	These two yellow ones go this way
2816400	2818400	This green one goes this way
2818400	2821400	We will only define such a defect
2821400	2823400	We call it a defect of phasing
2823400	2826400	So if it's dislocation or
2826400	2827400	Uh
2827400	2829400	Stack and fold
2829400	2832400	We don't have a clear definition
2845400	2848400	Hello
2848400	2849400	Hello
2855400	2856400	Hello
2865400	2866400	Hello
2866400	2869400	Hello
2869400	2872400	Sorry, can I ask a question now?
2872400	2875400	But the first one seems to be
2880400	2882400	Hi, welcome
2882400	2885400	Okay, so my question is actually very simple
2885400	2887400	You just said
2887400	2889400	Most of the clusters are in
2889400	2890400	Intermetallic
2890400	2891400	Found in the middle
2891400	2893400	That's the reason
2893400	2895400	Is there a possibility that
2895400	2897400	Uh, for example, in oxidized materials
2897400	2898400	Or other substances
2898400	2900400	Found in clusters
2900400	2901400	Oh
2901400	2903400	In fact, this is also a very interesting topic
2903400	2904400	In fact, in 2008
2904400	2906400	A lot of people in that
2906400	2907400	In the clusters
2907400	2909400	Found the so-called seven symmetries
2909400	2911400	With some special
2911400	2912400	Inexplicable symmetries
2912400	2914400	Do you have this?
2914400	2915400	Yes
2915400	2917400	But is it really so intermediate?
2917400	2919400	We can go and see
2923400	2926400	This pentagonal intermediate array
2926400	2928400	It can be so full
2928400	2930400	It's because it happens to be able to use two
2930400	2932400	Symmetry to put it up
2932400	2933400	In fact, this
2933400	2934400	This pentagonal intermediate array
2934400	2936400	It has many ways to fight
2936400	2937400	If you say
2937400	2940400	Is it possible to happen in ceramics?
2940400	2941400	But you have to think about ceramics
2941400	2944400	It has a stronger
2944400	2946400	So it might be more
2946400	2948400	Forced to be in a certain
2948400	2950400	In an agglomerated position
2950400	2951400	So I'm not sure if it's going to form
2951400	2953400	That kind of framework
2953400	2954400	But if it's a high-density
2954400	2956400	It's true that someone found out
2958400	2959400	I don't seem to have answered the question
2959400	2960400	Thank you
2960400	2962400	Did I answer your question?
2962400	2963400	Sorry
2963400	2965400	No problem
2965400	2967400	I'm just curious about the reason
2967400	2969400	Because it's yours
2969400	2971400	Is the size of your atom the same?
2971400	2975400	Or is it related to the metal ring itself?
2975400	2977400	You mean why?
2977400	2978400	I don't quite understand what you mean
2978400	2979400	You can talk about it again
2979400	2981400	That's what you just said
2981400	2983400	Your answer is more biased
2983400	2985400	Just because your
2985400	2987400	The size of the atom must be biased
2987400	2989400	So it can fill this
2989400	2991400	That's the edge
2991400	2993400	Is that what you mean?
2993400	2995400	No, because your atom is too big
2995400	2996400	Just keep pushing it
2996400	2997400	Push, push, push
2997400	2999400	It doesn't necessarily push
2999400	3000400	What you want
3000400	3002400	But most importantly
3002400	3003400	If the atom is too big
3003400	3004400	It can't fit in at all
3004400	3005400	We're going to put it in today
3005400	3007400	In a specific space
3007400	3010400	We
3010400	3012400	In general, we have to say
3012400	3014400	Because like here
3014400	3018400	It has an atom
3018400	3019400	Atomic Size Factor
3019400	3023400	The size of the atom
3023400	3024400	If this thing
3024400	3026400	When the radius is too big
3026400	3027400	It's a little bit
3027400	3029400	It's going to form a very large force field
3029400	3030400	This force field may make it
3030400	3033400	The whole structure will collapse
3033400	3034400	I see
3034400	3035400	Like there's a fat guy
3035400	3037400	There's a fat guy going to the cinema
3037400	3038400	The people next to him were knocked over
3038400	3040400	He just didn't feel well
3040400	3041400	I see
3041400	3043400	So how did he get sick?
3043400	3045400	It's kind of like the law of physics
3045400	3046400	Oh
3048400	3049400	I see
3049400	3051400	Then you have a
3051400	3054400	What is the density of the atom
3054400	3056400	Does this have anything to do with 1 and 3?
3056400	3058400	Or
3058400	3060400	1 and 3 themselves
3060400	3061400	There is no absolute relationship
3061400	3063400	Because this is actually the third point
3063400	3065400	We got it from the experiment
3065400	3066400	A
3066400	3068400	Experienced
3068400	3069400	If you look here
3069400	3071400	It's true that we're in this kind of
3071400	3072400	Green
3072400	3073400	In the three-dimensional solution
3073400	3075400	It will meet this condition
3075400	3076400	But if you are in the second dimension
3076400	3077400	Or some
3077400	3078400	In the case of fractured orbit
3078400	3079400	Or in
3079400	3081400	It will have some
3081400	3082400	It's a separate experience
3082400	3083400	It's a separate experience
3083400	3085400	But you have to meet three at the same time
3085400	3086400	What's the second one?
3086400	3088400	The second one is that the density can't be too big
3088400	3089400	Otherwise, the atomic property will be too strong
3089400	3091400	How to quantify too much
3091400	3092400	How to quantify too much
3092400	3093400	It's really a good question
3093400	3095400	Um
3095400	3096400	In fact, we usually say
3096400	3099400	Don't exceed
3099400	3102400	Density of 20% or more
3102400	3103400	1 and 3 is also the density
3103400	3104400	No, the second one is the density
3104400	3106400	The second one is the density
3106400	3108400	I thought it was some kind of formula
3108400	3109400	In fact, I also want to say
3109400	3111400	We've been discussing it before
3111400	3113400	Right right right
3118400	3119400	Hi
3122400	3123400	Oh, I see someone
3123400	3124400	I'm here
3124400	3125400	Um
3125400	3127400	Decagonal products are less
3127400	3128400	Is there any reason?
3128400	3130400	Because I only listed it today
3130400	3132400	Um
3132400	3134400	Stable
3134400	3135400	Oxide crystal
3135400	3137400	So decagonal is less
3137400	3139400	Because most of the decagonal
3139400	3141400	It's more like
3141400	3142400	Metastable
3142400	3145400	It's a stable state
3145400	3146400	That
3146400	3148400	In fact, we have been discussing in the past few years
3148400	3149400	One of the more important points is that
3149400	3151400	We know how to make stable accuracy
3151400	3153400	We know how to make stable accuracy
3153400	3155400	But we still don't know
3155400	3157400	Why is the accuracy stable?
3157400	3159400	What is its origin?
3159400	3160400	We still can't design
3160400	3163400	A better experiment to verify
3163400	3165400	Why is the accuracy stable?
3174400	3176400	Sorry to go back to that question
3176400	3178400	You said that you still can't determine
3178400	3180400	Why is the accuracy stable?
3180400	3182400	From this point, there is no way to do
3182400	3184400	DFT or quantum chemistry
3185400	3187400	Go from the structure of the generation
3187400	3189400	Or the electrical structure to understand
3189400	3191400	Why is it stable?
3191400	3193400	Oh, I think this question is good
3193400	3194400	But usually we have to do DFT
3194400	3196400	Or when you do this
3196400	3197400	We have a very important thing
3197400	3199400	Your wave function must have periodicity
3199400	3200400	but
3200400	3203400	Yes, yes, periodic boundary conditions
3203400	3204400	Yes, yes, yes, yes
3204400	3206400	But the accuracy, it has a periodicity
3206400	3207400	This accurate periodicity
3207400	3209400	It's a magnetic fraction
3209400	3211400	So you can't do DFT
3211400	3212400	But we are also in the current stage
3212400	3213400	There are some advanced ways to do
3213400	3215400	We put the accuracy
3215400	3217400	In a specific cubic structure
3217400	3219400	It will be very similar
3219400	3221400	It has a very similar symmetry
3221400	3224400	You can do it in this case
3224400	3227400	But so why is it actually a magnetic fraction
3227400	3230400	It's easier to find than accuracy
3230400	3232400	A lot of people have been like this recently
3232400	3233400	Yes
3233400	3236400	Then if it's because like DFT
3236400	3239400	Periodic boundary conditions are very important
3239400	3242400	What if it's a quantum chemistry method?
3242400	3243400	For example, Gaussian
3243400	3246400	Or it doesn't need periodic boundary conditions
3246400	3247400	It is directly
3247400	3248400	It's not using pseudo-potential
3248400	3251400	It is directly using the real atomic orbital
3251400	3255400	Then calculate some of its
3255400	3258400	It's the electromagnetic wave function
3258400	3262400	It does not consider the periodic brogue wave
3262400	3265400	Oh
3265400	3266400	Because of this part
3266400	3267400	I didn't follow it so carefully
3267400	3269400	We can discuss it in private later
3269400	3270400	Okay, thank you
3270400	3271400	I think this is quite interesting
3271400	3273400	But I remember someone did it
3273400	3275400	But it seems like I'm not sure
3275400	3277400	I might have to go back and look at the information
3277400	3279400	Because I remember someone did it
3286400	3288400	Can I ask a question?
3288400	3290400	Please say
3290400	3291400	I want to ask
3291400	3294400	I remember
3294400	3295400	Linus Pauling
3295400	3298400	He had a big argument before
3298400	3299400	That is to say
3299400	3303400	This quantum or an approximate
3303400	3309400	Will all produce a similar electromagnetic brogue wave
3309400	3310400	Yes
3310400	3314400	How do you actually distinguish these two things?
3314400	3316400	Ta-da
3318400	3321400	In fact, the main thing is
3321400	3326400	When the quantum is in the inner circle
3326400	3327400	There must be
3327400	3331400	For example, if we see a pentagon here
3331400	3334400	There will be a negative pentagon inside
3334400	3337400	But we see a pentagon here
3337400	3341400	But it's a cubic structure inside
3341400	3346400	This is the main thing we can see on the diffraction pattern
3346400	3352400	Quasi-crystal and approximate difference
3352400	3353400	This is because now
3353400	3354400	If we can make better feed
3354400	3357400	Or better electronic microscope resolution
3357400	3358400	I can see it
3358400	3360400	After all, like the earlier
3360400	3363400	If you take this pattern
3363400	3364400	You will find that you can see it
3364400	3367400	But its spots are not so beautiful
3367400	3369400	What did he just ask you?
3369400	3371400	Quasi-crystal and approximate
3371400	3372400	Linus Pauling
3372400	3374400	He argued at that time
3374400	3379400	If I put some specific pentagons in the cubic
3379400	3381400	Then make a double gold
3381400	3384400	I will get the same 10-fold diffraction pattern
3384400	3386400	But the two structures
3386400	3390400	The folding is different
3390400	3391400	But its periodic is different
3391400	3395400	So they must have different symmetry
3395400	3398400	Or you can just look at this diffraction pattern
3398400	3400400	Yes, so these two pictures show
3400400	3402400	It's the difference on the diffraction pattern
3402400	3403400	Should be able to distinguish
3403400	3404400	Yes, yes, yes
3404400	3406400	Now it's easier to distinguish
3406400	3408400	It was harder at that time
3408400	3409400	And the most important thing is
3409400	3411400	There is no stable crystalline at that time
3411400	3414400	So it will be an argument point
3414400	3418400	Oh, there is another follow-up question
3418400	3422400	That is, has anyone tried to do it under low temperature
3422400	3424400	Similar structural analysis
3424400	3426400	Because in this case
3426400	3430400	You are less affected by the phaseon
3430400	3431400	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
3431400	3434400	This is someone doing this thing
3434400	3438400	Because I'm not following the low temperature side
3438400	3440400	Just look at its physics
3440400	3442400	So if you are interested in this
3442400	3443400	We can also discuss it in person
3443400	3445400	I didn't follow so much
3445400	3448400	But I'm sure someone is doing this part
3448400	3451400	OK, thank you
3453400	3456400	I want to know about its electricity
3456400	3459400	That's why you just said
3459400	3463400	This thing is actually more like a semiconductor
3463400	3464400	Yes
3464400	3466400	Then why is it
3466400	3468400	It looks like metal added
3468400	3469400	Why does it become a semiconductor
3469400	3471400	Generally, metal is added casually
3471400	3473400	It won't be like this if you participate in a magazine
3473400	3474400	Yes
3474400	3477400	This is also why crystalline is so interesting
3477400	3480400	Usually we can have a few points to think about
3480400	3481400	Because it's actually a bit complicated
3481400	3483400	The first one is that it contains
3483400	3485400	Posi-periodicity
3485400	3487400	Will it cause its electronic
3487400	3490400	Frequency
3490400	3492400	Let's say we consider today
3493400	3495400	In micro-spatial motion
3495400	3497400	Its posi-periodicity
3497400	3499400	It will make its wave function
3499400	3502400	There will be a lot of destructive interference
3502400	3504400	It can't transmit very well
3504400	3505400	But at high temperature
3505400	3506400	Is it because of this energy
3506400	3508400	Because of pseudo-gap C
3508400	3509400	There is a second point
3509400	3510400	This point is one of them
3510400	3512400	The second point I think is more common
3512400	3514400	Because pseudo-gap itself
3514400	3517400	It's an energy state that can only be seen by electrons
3517400	3520400	In fact, when I was doing X-ray recently
3520400	3522400	Because the resolution is not enough
3522400	3524400	You have actually found some special phenomena recently
3524400	3526400	But there is no way to see the pseudo-gap
3526400	3527400	Did it actually change
3527400	3529400	When this temperature rises
3529400	3532400	This temperature dependence will make
3532400	3534400	Electrons jump through this pseudo-gap
3534400	3535400	So it makes the oscillation better
3535400	3537400	This is also one of the main reasons
3539400	3541400	Wait a minute, can you explain
3541400	3544400	Why is there a pseudo-gap in this thing?
3544400	3546400	How did the pseudo-gap come
3547400	3551400	Is this the same thing as the pseudo-gap of superconductivity?
3552400	3554400	Sorry, let me think about it again
3555400	3557400	The word pseudo-gap
3557400	3562400	It's usually a word that appears in high-temperature superconductors
3566400	3568400	You just found a gap
3568400	3570400	So you call it pseudo-gap
3572400	3573400	You can say that
3573400	3574400	But in fact, this pseudo-gap
3574400	3576400	The most important thing is that
3576400	3578400	When we stabilize the crystallized compound
3578400	3580400	The so-called
3580400	3582400	Because we went to see the bandgap structure
3582400	3584400	In fact, it is
3588400	3590400	What is the combination?
3590400	3592400	I forgot
3592400	3594400	Anyway, its gap
3594400	3598400	The most important thing is that it has something to do with Fermi sphere
3598400	3600400	We found that the pseudo-gap
3600400	3602400	Do you think it has anything to do with high-temperature superconductivity?
3604400	3606400	I don't think it doesn't matter
3606400	3608400	Because we are now
3608400	3610400	Because I'm not doing this specifically
3610400	3612400	But the author will usually mention
3612400	3614400	I only know the reason for the pseudo-gap
3614400	3616400	But I don't know
3616400	3618400	Does it have anything to do with the pseudo-gap of high-temperature superconductivity?
3618400	3620400	Your pseudo-gap refers to
3620400	3622400	The pseudo-gap in the bandgap structure
3622400	3624400	OK
3624400	3626400	In its structure
3626400	3628400	There is a gap in the bandstructure
3630400	3632400	Yes, there is a low energy point
3634400	3636400	OK
3638400	3640400	So it actually
3646400	3648400	Anyway, you said
3648400	3650400	Anyway, the result of the calculation
3650400	3652400	There is a gap
3652400	3654400	So it looks like
3654400	3656400	It's a bit like a semiconductor
3656400	3658400	How big is the gap?
3660400	3662400	How big is the gap?
3662400	3664400	Because each is not the same
3664400	3666400	And in fact, the pseudo-gap of high-temperature superconductivity cannot be calculated
3666400	3668400	What I just said
3668400	3670400	The so-called pseudo-gap is all from the near-term solution
3670400	3672400	How much is the near-term result?
3674400	3676400	I didn't remember this
3676400	3678400	I'll send you the data later
3680400	3682400	This is quite interesting
3684400	3686400	Sorry, I just talked about
3686400	3688400	You talked about the pseudo-gap
3688400	3690400	This should be able to use
3690400	3692400	Apex to measure
3692400	3694400	You can measure the bandstructure
3696400	3698400	I really want to measure it, but I have no chance
3700400	3702400	Because
3702400	3704400	As you said, the pseudo-gap cannot be calculated
3704400	3706400	In fact, the best way is to use Apex
3706400	3708400	But
3708400	3710400	I think if there is a chance to make better data
3710400	3712400	It is indeed a point to try
3712400	3714400	Because I recently found
3714400	3716400	The pn-reverse phenomenon in the pseudo-gap
3716400	3718400	This phenomenon may be with
3718400	3720400	Because its structure has not changed at all
3720400	3722400	But its
3722400	3724400	Eoverlay has not changed
3724400	3726400	But it has a very obvious pn-transition
3726400	3728400	So
3728400	3730400	If you can use Apex, please tell me
3730400	3732400	No, no way
3732400	3734400	I really want to do it
3734400	3736400	Because I think
3736400	3738400	Because there is no way to do it directly
3740400	3742400	Apex usually can only measure
3742400	3744400	Measure the valence band, right?
3744400	3746400	You can tell me
3748400	3750400	To be honest
3750400	3752400	I have never done Apex
3752400	3754400	I saw a lot of
3754400	3756400	Data is
3756400	3758400	Bandstructure
3758400	3760400	Apex seems to be able to measure
3760400	3762400	I'm not very sure
3762400	3764400	Because I don't have it
3764400	3766400	Usually need to move
3768400	3770400	I see
3770400	3772400	So you can see this thing
3774400	3776400	Yes
3780400	3782400	But
3782400	3784400	In fact, it is not very accurate
3784400	3786400	Because of the problem of feed processing
3786400	3788400	If you don't do it very well
3788400	3790400	Just for reference
3790400	3792400	I see
3796400	3798400	Can this material be used for doping?
3800400	3802400	This question is really good
3802400	3804400	Because we thought about it before
3804400	3806400	Try to do doping
3806400	3808400	But you know
3808400	3810400	This thing is already three-dimensional
3810400	3812400	If you do doping
3812400	3814400	The structure may be broken, it will be too complicated
3814400	3816400	Someone wanted to say before
3816400	3818400	This structure looks like a lot of defects
3818400	3820400	Is it possible to put cyan in it?
3820400	3822400	It's not really doping
3822400	3824400	But it's a new material
3824400	3826400	But after entering, you will find that its structure will collapse
3826400	3828400	So now we are less
3828400	3830400	Really do doping
3830400	3832400	Is it really doping?
3832400	3834400	Is also a problem
3834400	3836400	Because you can't make it go very smoothly
3836400	3838400	There is too much difference in each place
3838400	3840400	Then the second point is
3840400	3842400	If we talk about doping
3842400	3844400	We will only use substitution at most
3844400	3846400	Maybe substitution
3846400	3848400	We assume to add a substitution
3848400	3850400	A certain element in the cluster
3850400	3852400	To change its nature
3852400	3854400	There is no way to do
3854400	3856400	Really do doping
3856400	3858400	Because the structure may collapse
3862400	3864400	Is its doping
3864400	3866400	More like BCS?
3866400	3868400	Or is it exotic?
3870400	3872400	Its doping is actually super bad
3872400	3874400	Just have that phenomenon
3874400	3876400	It just found this phenomenon
3876400	3878400	There is no breakthrough in the weather
3878400	3880400	Just because it doesn't
3880400	3882400	Interfere with anything
3882400	3884400	But I saw this phenomenon
3884400	3886400	But the temperature is super low
3886400	3888400	So there is no application value
3888400	3890400	But it's interesting to study
3890400	3892400	Why don't we use anything
3892400	3894400	It has this feature
3894400	3896400	Most of the metal
3896400	3898400	Will have BCS doping
3898400	3900400	Yes, that's right
3904400	3906400	So this thing
3906400	3908400	I'm curious about this thing
3908400	3910400	Because it's metal
3910400	3912400	So it may be a BCS doping
3912400	3914400	You said it looks like ceramic
3914400	3916400	Like semiconductor
3916400	3918400	It may not be normal doping
3920400	3922400	Yes, it's not normal
3924400	3926400	It's not normal
3926400	3928400	They don't particularly study
3928400	3930400	Does it match BCS?
3930400	3932400	They are just mentioning a phenomenon
3932400	3934400	Because if it can be mentioned
3934400	3936400	It should not only be communication
3936400	3938400	So they just test it
3938400	3940400	Because like I just said
3940400	3942400	Our final challenge
3942400	3944400	How to make a better test
3944400	3946400	For a smaller area
3948400	3950400	Because what is it
3950400	3952400	It's really a little bit difficult
3952400	3954400	Because it's not that easy to control
3956400	3958400	You have to make a big one
3958400	3960400	A lot of phasing
3960400	3962400	A lot of defects
3962400	3964400	It's easy, but you have to do it
3964400	3966400	It's a little bit difficult
3970400	3972400	Do you have any other questions?
3972400	3974400	Okay, let's thank Zong
3974400	3976400	For bringing us a wonderful speech
3976400	3978400	And a great Q&A
3978400	3980400	Thank you
3980400	3982400	Thank you
3982400	3984400	If you have any questions
3984400	3986400	If you are really interested in BCS
3986400	3988400	Because my speech is not very good
3988400	3990400	If you are interested
3990400	3992400	You can come back to me
3992400	3994400	I think
3994400	3996400	It's a little bit difficult
3996400	3998400	Because it's a little bit difficult
3998400	4000400	If you are interested
4000400	4002400	You can come back to me
4002400	4004400	I think it makes me think a lot of questions
4004400	4006400	I hope everyone
4006400	4008400	If you are interested
4008400	4010400	You can join this field
4010400	4012400	You see so many people in front
4012400	4014400	Cosmology
4014400	4016400	Actually it's ok
4016400	4018400	I will turn off the recording now
