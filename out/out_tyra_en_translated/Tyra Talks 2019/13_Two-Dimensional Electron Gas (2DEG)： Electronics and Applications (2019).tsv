0	7000	Hello, everyone. I'm Jason Hong.
7000	10000	I'm the host for today.
10000	24000	Today, we're honored to have two postdocs from the Japanese Institute of理化學研究所, RIKEN.
24000	30000	One is the founder of TAIRA, Ted Chang.
30000	35000	The other is Xu Chengxuan.
36000	45000	Ted Chang is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Emerging Sciences.
45000	55000	His research focuses on the interaction between light and light-emitting ions.
55000	59000	Chengxuan focuses on theory.
59000	76000	His research focuses on the interaction between spin-orbital interaction and Latin geoliquid effects on nanostructure.
76000	83000	We're honored to have them here today.
83000	103000	Today's topic is 2-Dimensional Electron Gas, 2DEC, Electronic and Application.
103000	118000	I'd like to ask Ted Chang to introduce 2-Dimensional Electron Gas.
118000	125000	Can you hear me?
133000	147000	Most of the audience is muted.
147000	152000	If you have any questions, please turn on the microphone.
153000	163000	There's a line on the right side of the screen, which means you're muted.
163000	172000	You can also leave a comment in the chat box on the right.
172000	179000	Hello, I'm Ted Chang.
179000	186000	Today I'm going to talk about 2DEC.
186000	189000	2DEC stands for 2-Dimensional Electron Gas.
189000	199000	We use semiconductors to generate different heterostructure materials.
199000	205000	We can also do some interesting experiments by adding some processes.
205000	228000	Later on, Ted Chang will talk about how to use 2DEC to generate heterostructure materials.
228000	237000	I'm going to talk about how to generate 2DEC.
237000	242000	We're going to talk about how to generate quantum dots.
242000	247000	In quantum dots, we can trap a single electron.
248000	259000	In this experiment, we're going to measure the direction of polarization of light.
259000	265000	The result is a single electron.
265000	270000	We can also generate entangled photons.
270000	274000	This is a technology that has been around for 20 years.
274000	282000	We can generate entangled photons and spins.
282000	288000	Let's talk about 2DEC.
288000	293000	Why do we want to enter 2DEC?
293000	306000	In fact, in 3D life, the phenomenon is different in 2D.
306000	309000	This is a very special example.
309000	319000	In 2D space, it is not possible for an animal to live in 2D space.
319000	321000	Why?
321000	326000	Because this dog will be separated by its digestive tract.
326000	334000	Dogs in 2D space are not likely to exist in 2D space.
334000	344000	Because the physical conditions in 2D space are different, there will be different phenomena.
344000	352000	What method do we use to observe 2DEC?
352000	359000	Let's talk about how 2DEC is generated.
359000	364000	We will also introduce some basic characteristics of 2DEC.
364000	380000	If we have different semiconductor materials, which phenomenon is the most important to characterize the good or bad of these materials?
381000	395000	From 2DEC, we will introduce how to control the production of electrons or even a single electron in the material.
395000	410000	How does 2DEC interact with a single electron?
410000	428000	This is a diagram of 3 different materials.
428000	435000	The left bottom corner is the material of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide.
435000	440000	The band structure of these two materials is different.
440000	463000	The band structure on the left is the material of gallium arsenide, and the band structure on the right is the material of aluminum gallium arsenide.
463000	471000	When the two materials are stacked together, a quantum well is generated.
471000	486000	In the middle of the quantum well, the Fermi energy, which occupies the highest electromagnetic field, can be adjusted.
486000	515000	The material of gallium arsenide can move freely in the 2D space.
515000	522000	At the same time, different materials can be used to make similar 2DEC.
522000	528000	Later on, we will introduce gallium arsenide.
528000	538000	In our lab, we are also working on silicon and silicon germanium, which are also heterostructures.
539000	547000	In this material, we will focus on the characteristics of gallium arsenide.
547000	553000	The main thing is that we hope that its mobility is basically the higher the better.
553000	556000	Mobility is also related to a lot of things.
556000	564000	Usually, the mean free path is very long, and the scheduling time is very short.
564000	584000	In this material, we will focus on the phase coherence lab, which is the interaction between electrons.
584000	587000	We hope that the interaction between electrons will be better and better.
587000	590000	Of course, it is different for different materials.
590000	596000	But basically, our main concern is mobility, mean free path, and scheduling time.
596000	603000	Gallium arsenide is a very mature technology.
603000	611000	Now it can grow to tens of millions, which is no problem.
612000	618000	Of course, there are many limitations in other materials.
618000	627000	The impurities in the middle of each layer may not match.
627000	631000	So in this aspect, its mobility will be reduced.
631000	639000	In contrast, its mean free path and scheduling time are not so good.
639000	665000	Next, we will talk about how to use mature manufacturing technology to make special components from 2DEC.
665000	668000	This picture looks very old.
668000	672000	Indeed, this is a paper published in 1996.
673000	686000	It uses gallium arsenide with a similar structure.
686000	693000	So it has gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide, and gallium arsenide, which are different doping materials.
693000	698000	It can add electrons up and down.
698000	710000	So it has a dot in the middle, which is a 2D artificial atom.
710000	716000	Because its electrons can only be confined to this layer,
716000	725000	we used to think that our electronic architecture has a lot of S, P, and D domain.
725000	729000	But it is S, P, D, and L in three-dimensional space.
729000	736000	But in 2D, its S, P, D, and L, its orbital angular number is different.
737000	745000	Because of the discovery of 2D artificial atom,
745000	766000	we created a periodic table for 2D artificial atoms.
767000	769000	The elements in this table are very interesting.
769000	776000	It is named after the person who discovered this phenomenon.
776000	785000	Our group, Tarucha, is in the upper left corner of the periodic table.
788000	790000	There are many famous people in this table.
790000	798000	This is one of the researchers of Mariana Fermi.
801000	809000	In addition to using the H method to describe different elements,
809000	816000	there is another method that is commonly used now.
816000	818000	It is to put an electrode on it.
818000	826000	For example, in 1988, they started to put an electrode on 2D.
826000	837000	The current from the left to the right is a quantized conductance.
837000	847000	When passing through the channel, the wave function can only be confined to these directions.
847000	851000	So the conductance is quantized.
853000	855000	This is a picture of its side.
855000	859000	When you apply voltage to the electrode below,
859000	864000	the lower the voltage, the narrower the channel below.
864000	869000	At the same time, it also controls the height of the level.
869000	879000	This is how it produces quantized conductance.
879000	884000	Sorry, sometimes it doesn't work.
884000	886000	Oh, yes, quantized conductance.
886000	892000	Next, we will slowly enter the topic.
892000	897000	Recently, everyone has been discussing quantum computing.
897000	904000	How to use quantum dot or quantum confine in the direction of quantum,
904000	909000	and how to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.
909000	917000	This paper was written by Chen Xuanhui's boss in 1998.
917000	925000	How to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.
926000	934000	Basically, the concept is that when we apply voltage to the electrode above,
934000	945000	there are some electrons below that can only stay in this area.
945000	950000	This is because it is confined to one end, so it is in quantum dot.
950000	955000	How to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.
955000	959000	Apply different voltages to the gate in the middle,
959000	962000	so that the interaction between electrons becomes stronger or weaker.
962000	969000	So that it has the effect of exchange.
972000	976000	Next, let's move on to my real experiment.
976000	982000	This is our dilution fridge.
982000	986000	Our components are placed on a chip on the dilution fridge.
986000	999000	The real size is about 1cm x 1cm.
1000000	1004000	As long as you apply voltage to the electrode above,
1004000	1009000	you can control the production of quantum dot.
1009000	1012000	For example, this is an SEM graph.
1012000	1019000	The quantum dot produced here is produced in the electrode confined here.
1019000	1024000	Its size is about 100nm.
1024000	1027000	In addition to producing double quantum dot,
1027000	1031000	the same device can also produce single quantum dot.
1031000	1038000	When the voltage in the middle is not so high,
1038000	1044000	the whole space can let the electrons stay in the middle.
1044000	1050000	In this place, we can measure its conductance.
1051000	1060000	It is like a horizontal line.
1060000	1064000	When the voltage in the middle increases,
1064000	1078000	it produces a stability diagram.
1079000	1084000	Next, I will talk about how our experiment is going.
1084000	1094000	The optical part is producing entangled photons in the left half of the graph.
1094000	1100000	Entangled photons are basically two different nonlinear crystals.
1101000	1104000	One is producing double quantum dot,
1104000	1110000	and the other is producing entangled photons.
1110000	1116000	When we measure the polarization of the photon on one side,
1116000	1121000	we measure the spin of the electron on the other side.
1121000	1124000	Is the electron spinning up or down?
1125000	1129000	This is a work from five years ago.
1129000	1133000	When a single electron is produced,
1133000	1140000	it is related to the direction of polarization of the photon.
1140000	1149000	When you produce a circular polarization with different velocities,
1149000	1159000	it produces different traces of electrons.
1159000	1168000	Next, we will talk about how to use the irradiated light
1168000	1171000	to produce a single electron.
1171000	1177000	How do we measure the direction of the electron's spin?
1177000	1190000	Next, we will measure the direction of the electron's spin from horizontal to spin up or vertical to spin down.
1190000	1198000	This is to use the electron and hole pair produced.
1198000	1204000	We use the light hole instead of the heavy hole.
1204000	1214000	This method allows us to produce different spin directions from horizontal to vertical.
1214000	1218000	How to do spin readout?
1218000	1228000	We use a method called spin-to-charge conversion.
1229000	1235000	We hope that the spin-up and spin-down are different.
1235000	1237000	How do we do this?
1237000	1242000	We use a phenomenon called Pauli Spin Blockade.
1242000	1248000	If you know the Pauli Exclusion Principle,
1248000	1254000	you will know that if the electron spins up or down on both sides,
1254000	1259000	it will not be able to move from the left to the right.
1259000	1262000	This is our basic way of doing it.
1262000	1269000	In the experiment, we let the quantum dot on the right have an electron.
1269000	1275000	The blue star represents 0 and 1.
1275000	1279000	0 and 1 represent the charge state of different quantum dots.
1279000	1290000	When another electron is produced, it will enter 1 or 0.2.
1290000	1294000	If the electron is produced in the opposite direction,
1294000	1301000	it will spin left and right.
1301000	1308000	When the electron is produced in the opposite direction,
1308000	1314000	it will spin left and right.
1314000	1320000	When the electron is produced in the opposite direction,
1320000	1328000	it will spin left and right.
1329000	1338000	This is how we measure the direction of single spin.
1338000	1345000	This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.
1345000	1348000	If it is in a different direction of spin,
1348000	1351000	its trace will be different.
1351000	1356000	This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.
1356000	1361000	This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.
1361000	1364000	How do we produce an entangled photon?
1364000	1367000	This is a very mature technology.
1367000	1370000	Because the quantum dot moves,
1370000	1380000	the light in the two circles will move in the opposite direction.
1380000	1388000	The light in the two circles will move in the opposite direction.
1388000	1392000	If you measure the polarization of the light in the two circles,
1392000	1401000	If you measure the polarization of the light in the two circles,
1401000	1405000	it will be an entangled state.
1405000	1408000	it will be an entangled state.
1408000	1414000	Next, we measure the light.
1414000	1419000	Next, we measure the light.
1419000	1427000	Next, we measure the light.
1427000	1439000	If the light receives the two signals at the same time,
1439000	1446000	it means that we have an entangled photon and an entangled spin.
1446000	1450000	This is the result of our experiment last year.
1450000	1455000	It produces an entangled photon and an entangled spin.
1455000	1460000	It produces an entangled photon and an entangled spin.
1460000	1465000	This is the end of the main experiment.
1466000	1475000	Here I explain how 2D Electron GANs is formed.
1475000	1484000	Here I explain how 2D Electron GANs is formed.
1484000	1490000	Usually, the quantum dot is produced differently.
1490000	1494000	Some products are self-assembled quantum dots,
1494000	1499000	because the structure of the golden frame
1499000	1505000	has a defect, and this defect becomes a quantum dot.
1505000	1513000	Compared to us, we use predetermined electrons
1513000	1517000	to apply different voltages to produce a single dot, a double dot.
1517000	1522000	So these are very controllable things.
1522000	1531000	Next, I will talk about how to measure the direction of the single electron.
1531000	1536000	We will also talk about how to change the direction of the light
1536000	1542000	from a different bias to a different direction of the electron.
1542000	1549000	Finally, we will talk about how to use the entangled photon
1549000	1556000	to produce different directions of the electron,
1556000	1562000	and how to produce entangled photons and spin pairs.
1562000	1569000	That's all for today.
1569000	1574000	Our lab is the Quantum Functional System Research Group
1574000	1577000	at the Institute of Physics and Chemistry.
1577000	1585000	Our main PI is Harucha,
1585000	1590000	and we have other partners,
1590000	1596000	such as Chenxuan and Loss,
1596000	1600000	and OIWA, a group from Osaka University.
1600000	1606000	Our wafers are provided by a German school and organization.
1606000	1612000	That's all for today.
1612000	1615000	Thank you.
1615000	1620000	Thank you, Ted, for the wonderful talk.
1620000	1624000	If you have any questions,
1624000	1627000	please feel free to ask.
1635000	1639000	If not, I will ask a question.
1639000	1645000	You mentioned that mobility is very important.
1646000	1654000	Where does mobility and phase coherence time affect quantum computing?
1654000	1660000	Why are these properties important?
1667000	1674000	Phase coherence time limits the size of the quantum dot.
1674000	1681000	The phase coherence length and mean free path of a quantum dot
1681000	1687000	can reach tens of microns.
1687000	1693000	The requirements for the process are less than 1 micron.
1693000	1701000	Silicon is much smaller, about 10 times smaller.
1702000	1710000	Therefore, it is more difficult for us to experiment or process.
1710000	1718000	The size of the quantum dot must be at least 100 nanometers or less.
1719000	1725000	What we are doing now is to control the electron in this area.
1725000	1731000	If there are still some phenomena in this area,
1731000	1737000	this is not ideal.
1737000	1743000	Basically, mobility, mean free path, and phase coherence length
1743000	1749000	affect the size of the component process.
1749000	1755000	Of course, there are different difficulties.
1755000	1761000	For example, if my SEM graph shows that
1761000	1767000	the size of a dot is about 200 to 300 nanometers.
1768000	1774000	So a dot is about 200 nanometers or less.
1774000	1780000	Silicon is super difficult to make, so it will be more difficult.
1780000	1786000	But the Galien Arsenide you show has a coherence length of 40 microns.
1786000	1792000	So even if you make it less than 40 microns,
1792000	1798000	you can still make it.
1798000	1804000	It doesn't matter if it's less than 1 micron.
1804000	1810000	1 micron is already very easy to make.
1810000	1816000	Basically, photolithography can be done.
1816000	1822000	Do you have any questions?
1822000	1828000	We are very informal, so you can ask as many questions as possible.
1828000	1834000	Hello, can you hear me?
1834000	1840000	Can you hear me?
1840000	1848000	I have a question.
1848000	1856000	Do you know how long the coherence time can be less?
1856000	1864000	What is the relaxation time after entanglement?
1864000	1870000	For electrons, it's very small.
1870000	1876000	Because it's in the Galien Arsenide, it's about 100 nanoseconds.
1876000	1882000	I see.
1882000	1890000	So it's still limited by the time of entanglement.
1890000	1898000	Basically, in the Galien Arsenide, there are many different nucleons.
1898000	1906000	These nucleons will interact with electrons.
1906000	1914000	So it can be about a few hundred nanoseconds.
1914000	1922000	In the Galien Arsenide, it's very short.
1922000	1930000	But in silicon, it's about 20 milliseconds.
1930000	1938000	Because silicon can be purified,
1938000	1946000	silicon can be purified, and silicon can be purified.
1946000	1952000	Thank you.
1952000	1958000	Any other questions?
1958000	1966000	If not, let's invite Chenxuan to give the next speech.
1966000	1972000	Okay, thank you.
1972000	1982000	Hello, everyone.
1982000	1988000	Can you see my slides now?
1988000	1992000	Yes.
1992000	1996000	Thank you, Jason.
1996000	2000000	Thank you, Ted, for the invitation.
2000000	2004000	My name is Chenxuan Xu.
2004000	2010000	I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.
2010000	2018000	I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.
2018000	2024000	I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.
2024000	2030000	In my research, I focus on spin-orbital coupling.
2030000	2036000	So I'll start by introducing spin-orbital coupling in nanostructure.
2036000	2044000	Then I'll talk about why we're interested in very strong spin-orbital coupling.
2044000	2050000	Then I'll talk about why we're interested in very strong spin-orbital coupling.
2050000	2054000	This is our recent theoretical research.
2054000	2058000	When you have a very strong spin-orbital coupling in nanowire,
2058000	2064000	what will happen to your charge transport, current, or inductance?
2064000	2068000	Okay, let's start our introduction.
2068000	2074000	In nanostructure, we usually have inversion symmetry breaking.
2074000	2078000	These inversion symmetry breaking are equivalent to a circuit.
2078000	2082000	When electrons move in these inversion symmetry breaking,
2082000	2086000	there is a magnetic field in its inversion symmetry breaking.
2086000	2090000	This magnetic field, of course, will be coupled with its spin coupling.
2090000	2094000	In our experimental inversion symmetry breaking,
2094000	2098000	it looks like its spin and momentum will be coupled.
2098000	2102000	Because momentum is related to its orbital motion,
2102000	2106000	we call this coupling spin-orbital coupling.
2106000	2110000	In nanostructure, there are mainly two kinds of symmetry breaking.
2110000	2114000	The first one is what Ted just introduced.
2114000	2118000	Because we're going to form two decks, we'll have some heterostructure.
2118000	2122000	So in the z-direction, there's a magnetic field.
2122000	2128000	This magnetic field will cause this spin-orbital coupling.
2128000	2132000	Then we call it rush-button coupling.
2132000	2136000	In addition to this structure,
2136000	2142000	our material is usually made up of 3-5 sets of semiconductors.
2142000	2148000	So in its crystal, there's usually inversion symmetry breaking.
2148000	2152000	This inversion symmetry breaking will give us another phase.
2152000	2156000	We call it Dresselhaus turn.
2156000	2160000	I'll give you two examples.
2160000	2164000	What kind of effect does this coupling have in nanostructure?
2164000	2168000	One of the effects is that
2168000	2172000	when we continue to confine this two-deck to a dot,
2172000	2176000	which is one of the applications Ted just talked about.
2176000	2180000	Usually, after we form a common dot,
2180000	2186000	if we want to do some further spin qubits experiments,
2186000	2188000	we usually add a magnetic field.
2188000	2192000	We found that if you have a magnetic field
2192000	2194000	coupled with spin-orbital coupling,
2194000	2198000	you'll change the G-factor in the dot.
2198000	2202000	The G-factor is important here
2202000	2204000	because it affects Zeeman splitting.
2204000	2208000	Of course, it affects the nature of the dot electron.
2208000	2212000	So we have a paper in our group
2212000	2216000	discussing this nature.
2216000	2218000	That's the effect.
2218000	2222000	The second example is related to the topic I'm going to talk about today.
2222000	2228000	If your two-deck later forms a wire,
2228000	2230000	usually your wire won't have...
2230000	2232000	your cross-section won't be zero.
2232000	2236000	So you'll have some finite width.
2236000	2240000	This is the so-called quasi-1D.
2240000	2242000	This is what I call quasi-1D.
2242000	2244000	In this case, we found that
2244000	2246000	spin-orbital coupling will form some
2246000	2248000	bend-distortion properties.
2248000	2252000	I'm going to talk a little bit more about this.
2254000	2258000	First of all, in a common experiment,
2258000	2262000	we'll add some magnetic fields.
2262000	2265000	So the situation I'm going to discuss next,
2265000	2266000	the experiment is that
2266000	2269000	the launch button is far greater than the tracer host.
2269000	2272000	So I'll just look at the launch button next.
2272000	2276000	In the case of quasi-1D,
2276000	2279000	we know that there will be kinetic energy
2279000	2281000	along the direction of the wire.
2281000	2283000	So that's the term.
2283000	2287000	In the y-direction, I'll have some confinement.
2287000	2291000	I can take this part of the energy spectrum quantized.
2291000	2295000	So it's equivalent to this kind of energy splitting.
2295000	2298000	So this is my sub-bend term.
2298000	2300000	The launch button will result in
2300000	2302000	the mixing of these two parts.
2302000	2304000	I just mentioned that
2304000	2306000	the launch button spin-orbital coupling
2306000	2308000	can have these two terms.
2308000	2310000	Let's look at the first term,
2310000	2313000	which is the term related to Kx.
2313000	2318000	It's related to the momentum along the wire.
2318000	2322000	So the effect of this term is that
2322000	2324000	in the energy spectrum,
2324000	2327000	it splits the quadratic dispersion
2327000	2329000	of the upper and lower order.
2329000	2331000	So there's this shift.
2331000	2334000	If I add the second term of
2334000	2337000	the launch button spin-orbital coupling,
2337000	2341000	this term will couple these two states
2341000	2345000	in this little green circle.
2345000	2349000	So it splits the different sub-bends
2349000	2352000	with the opposite spin-orbital coupling.
2352000	2355000	If I add these two terms,
2355000	2358000	I'll find that the energy spectrum
2358000	2361000	of my quantum wire will be distorted.
2361000	2363000	This means that
2363000	2366000	if I have a Fermi energy here,
2366000	2369000	we'll find that the energy spectrum
2369000	2371000	of branch A and branch B,
2371000	2374000	which is the red and blue energy spectrum,
2374000	2377000	the Fermi velocity will be different.
2377000	2380000	So I call this bend-distortion.
2380000	2382000	This is another effect of
2382000	2385000	the launch button spin-orbital coupling.
2385000	2388000	Another one is that it may mix
2388000	2390000	the upper and lower order.
2390000	2393000	Mainly because of the spin-orbital coupling,
2393000	2396000	your spin is no longer a good quantum number.
2396000	2401000	We have some simple calculations here.
2401000	2404000	The left side is the energy spectrum.
2404000	2407000	If I have a chemical potential,
2407000	2410000	assuming that the chemical potential
2410000	2413000	is slowly tuned from the bottom to the top,
2413000	2416000	the graph on the right is equivalent to
2416000	2419000	from left to right.
2419000	2422000	We're calculating the spin expectation value
2422000	2425000	of these four different states.
2425000	2430000	We'll find that because of the spin-orbital coupling,
2430000	2434000	the spin will change with the chemical potential.
2434000	2436000	This is one effect.
2436000	2439000	The second effect is what I just said.
2439000	2442000	Because these two energy bands
2442000	2445000	have different velocities,
2445000	2448000	we can also calculate their velocities
2448000	2451000	and find that they are also related to the chemical potential.
2451000	2454000	Here is a brief introduction
2454000	2457000	of these effects.
2458000	2461000	Now, I'd like to go back to the beginning
2461000	2464000	and ask why we're interested in
2464000	2467000	spin-orbital coupling.
2472000	2475000	This question is equivalent to asking
2475000	2479000	why spin-orbital coupling is so important.
2479000	2482000	Is it because it can be eaten?
2482000	2485000	If you're in Kalucha's group,
2485000	2488000	you'll find that they can make
2488000	2491000	a double nanowire cake.
2491000	2494000	If you're a good friend of their group,
2494000	2497000	you can eat this delicious double nanowire cake.
2497000	2500000	But apart from being edible,
2500000	2503000	the most important thing for us is
2503000	2506000	that if you have spin-orbital coupling,
2506000	2509000	you can use it to achieve Majorna bond states.
2509000	2512000	This is a relatively popular material
2513000	2516000	in the field of spin-orbital coupling.
2516000	2519000	Next, I'd like to introduce
2519000	2522000	what Majorna bond states are.
2522000	2525000	This is more than 80 years ago.
2525000	2528000	Majorana was an Italian physicist.
2528000	2531000	He proposed that
2531000	2534000	in the Dirac equation,
2534000	2537000	there is a real solution.
2537000	2540000	The solution is called Majorna fermions.
2541000	2544000	They are their own antimatter.
2544000	2547000	The reason why we're interested in
2547000	2550000	condensers and solid-state physics
2550000	2553000	is because we later found that
2553000	2556000	Majorna fermions may not be able to
2556000	2559000	or we may not be able to
2559000	2562000	verify that they are elementary particles.
2562000	2565000	But they may be able to be realized
2565000	2568000	in solid-state physics,
2569000	2572000	especially in the last 10 years.
2572000	2575000	The paper by Ulrich and Dasama
2575000	2578000	tells you that
2578000	2581000	if you want to achieve Majorna fermions,
2581000	2584000	you only need some easy-to-do setups.
2584000	2587000	You just need some spin-orbital nanowires
2587000	2590000	to achieve Majorna bond states.
2590000	2593000	Because of the appearance of these two papers,
2593000	2596000	people started to notice
2597000	2600000	that we may be able to achieve Majorna bond states.
2600000	2603000	Of course, Majorna bond states
2603000	2606000	are very popular.
2606000	2609000	The other reason is that
2609000	2612000	they are thought to provide
2612000	2615000	some topological quantum computation.
2615000	2618000	So you can use them to do quantum computing.
2618000	2621000	This is one of the reasons
2621000	2624000	why people are interested in them.
2624000	2627000	Because of this nature,
2627000	2630000	you may be able to do quantum computation.
2630000	2633000	People want to know
2633000	2636000	if they can really do it.
2636000	2639000	Let me introduce the most
2639000	2642000	well-known or
2642000	2645000	carefully studied setup,
2645000	2648000	that is, using single-wire.
2648000	2651000	As I said, if you convert an electron
2651000	2654000	into a single-wire,
2654000	2657000	and if the material has a strong spin-orbital coupling,
2657000	2660000	for example,
2660000	2663000	you can use indium arsenide or indium montmorillonide.
2663000	2666000	As you know,
2666000	2669000	these materials have a strong spin-orbital coupling.
2669000	2672000	If you have these materials,
2672000	2675000	and you add some magnetic field
2675000	2678000	along the direction of the wire,
2678000	2681000	basically,
2681000	2684000	you can have this effect.
2684000	2687000	If you have large-spin-orbital coupling,
2687000	2690000	as I said,
2690000	2693000	the dispersion will be shifted.
2693000	2696000	If you add another magnetic field,
2696000	2699000	it will open a Zeeman gap
2699000	2702000	at the zero-momentum point.
2702000	2705000	If your chemical potential
2705000	2708000	is fine-tuned to this area,
2708000	2711000	you will have helical modes.
2711000	2714000	Helical modes are the electrons
2714000	2717000	on the right and on the left
2717000	2720000	with different spin,
2720000	2723000	which is called helical modes.
2723000	2726000	If you put such a wire
2726000	2729000	on a superconductor,
2729000	2732000	you will find that
2732000	2735000	at the zero-momentum point,
2735000	2738000	the system gap is determined by two parameters.
2738000	2741000	One is the pairing gap,
2741000	2744000	and the other is the Zeeman gap.
2744000	2747000	This means that you have two gap openings
2747000	2750000	competing against each other.
2750000	2753000	Both gaps want to open,
2753000	2756000	but their opening signs are opposite.
2756000	2759000	So the system gap
2760000	2763000	means that
2763000	2766000	if I put my wire on the superconductor,
2766000	2769000	my pairing gap will be fixed.
2769000	2772000	If I slowly open my magnetic field,
2772000	2775000	the system gap,
2775000	2778000	the gap of the entire energy spectrum,
2778000	2781000	will shrink,
2781000	2784000	and it will be closed at a certain point.
2784000	2787000	If I continue to open my magnetic field,
2787000	2790000	it will be reopened.
2790000	2793000	Here we find a topological phase transition.
2793000	2796000	In this area on the right,
2796000	2799000	we find that the band is inversed.
2799000	2802000	Because of this band inversion,
2802000	2805000	we find that in this area,
2805000	2808000	you can achieve Majorna bond state.
2808000	2811000	You can see that
2811000	2814000	the elements needed here
2815000	2818000	sound quite simple.
2818000	2821000	As long as you have a magnetic field,
2821000	2824000	a superconductor,
2824000	2827000	and strong enough spin-over coupling,
2827000	2830000	you can achieve Majorna bond state.
2830000	2833000	It sounds quite convenient,
2833000	2836000	so we put a lot of effort
2836000	2839000	into studying this setup.
2839000	2842000	But there is a difficulty.
2843000	2846000	Because you need a magnetic field,
2846000	2849000	the magnetic field tends to disrupt the superconductor.
2849000	2852000	In other words,
2852000	2855000	your entire gap is usually affected by the magnetic field.
2855000	2858000	In other words,
2858000	2861000	your Majorna bond state
2861000	2864000	is usually in the middle of the gap.
2864000	2867000	The smaller the gap,
2867000	2870000	the weaker the protection.
2870000	2873000	So you don't need a magnetic field.
2873000	2876000	This makes people,
2876000	2879000	especially those who do theoretical research,
2879000	2882000	wonder if there are other mechanisms.
2882000	2885000	As mentioned earlier,
2885000	2888000	we need the so-called gap opening
2888000	2891000	to open the gap
2891000	2894000	and achieve Majorna bond state.
2894000	2897000	If we look at it the other way around,
2897000	2900000	if we look at it the other way around,
2900000	2903000	before the pairing gap,
2903000	2906000	my energy spectrum
2906000	2909000	is equivalent to
2909000	2912000	a spin-selected gap in my energy spectrum.
2912000	2915000	That is, the gap opening
2915000	2918000	between the upper and lower branches
2918000	2921000	is different in the momentum space.
2921000	2924000	Is it possible
2924000	2927000	to have a spin-selected gap?
2927000	2930000	People later found out that
2930000	2933000	if you have a wire
2933000	2936000	and feel the rotating magnetic field,
2936000	2939000	you can achieve a spin-selected gap.
2939000	2942000	you can achieve a spin-selected gap.
2942000	2945000	People later found out that
2945000	2948000	in the case of a single-wire,
2948000	2951000	the conduction electron has a so-called RKKY coupling.
2951000	2954000	This RKKY coupling
2954000	2957000	can achieve a very special spin order.
2957000	2960000	can achieve a very special spin order.
2960000	2963000	This spin will automatically
2963000	2966000	generate a rotating order.
2966000	2969000	This order can be used to achieve
2969000	2972000	the very special gap we just mentioned.
2972000	2975000	That is, if you have this RKKY system,
2975000	2978000	That is, if you have this RKKY system,
2978000	2981000	you automatically have a spin-off coupling.
2981000	2984000	you automatically have a spin-off coupling.
2984000	2987000	That is, you have a synthetic spin-off coupling.
2987000	2990000	That is, you have a synthetic spin-off coupling.
2990000	2993000	If you put such a system on the super island,
2993000	2996000	you will have different competing mechanisms.
2996000	2999000	you will have different competing mechanisms.
2999000	3002000	You can have band-inversion
3002000	3005000	and you can achieve Myrna-Brown state.
3005000	3008000	Our group also used a similar mechanism a while ago.
3008000	3011000	Our group also used a similar mechanism a while ago.
3011000	3014000	We found that if you use carbon-13,
3014000	3017000	which is different from the usual carbon-12,
3017000	3020000	which is different from the usual carbon-12,
3020000	3023000	it will have nuclear spin.
3023000	3026000	If you use carbon-13 nanotube,
3026000	3029000	you will find that it will automatically generate this helix.
3029000	3032000	If you put this nanotube on the super island,
3032000	3035000	you can achieve Myrna-Brown state.
3035000	3038000	Of course, there may also be different setups.
3038000	3041000	Of course, there may also be different setups.
3041000	3044000	What we were doing a while ago was using higher-order TI.
3044000	3047000	What we were doing a while ago was using higher-order TI.
3047000	3050000	In this case, your material will have this so-called
3050000	3053000	gapless-hinged state.
3053000	3056000	We found that if you put the super conductor on the material,
3056000	3059000	We found that if you put the super conductor on the material,
3059000	3062000	you can achieve two different pairings.
3062000	3065000	One is the so-called non-local pairing,
3065000	3068000	and the other is the local pairing.
3068000	3071000	You can achieve Myrna-Brown state
3071000	3074000	because of the competition between these two different pairings.
3074000	3077000	Today's topic is more related to
3077000	3080000	the so-called double nanowire setup.
3080000	3083000	Today's topic is more related to
3083000	3086000	the so-called double nanowire setup.
3087000	3090000	You put two nanowires on the super conductor.
3090000	3093000	You put two nanowires on the super conductor.
3093000	3096000	There are two ways for the cooper pair to enter the nanowire.
3096000	3099000	You can enter the same nanowire,
3099000	3102000	which is called local pairing.
3102000	3105000	You can also enter different nanowires.
3105000	3108000	Theoretically, you will find that
3108000	3111000	if you have non-local pairing greater than local pairing,
3111000	3114000	you can also achieve Myrna-Brown state.
3115000	3118000	This can explain our motivation.
3118000	3121000	This can explain our motivation.
3121000	3124000	Basically, we want to know
3124000	3127000	that we can have some spin-octal coupling nanowires
3127000	3130000	that we want to know that we can have some spin-octal coupling nanowires
3130000	3133000	that we can try to put on the super conductor.
3133000	3136000	How do we achieve this condition,
3136000	3139000	that is, non-local pairing greater than local pairing?
3139000	3142000	This is another theoretical study.
3142000	3145000	This is another theoretical study.
3145000	3148000	If your electronic interaction is strong enough,
3148000	3151000	you are likely to achieve this condition.
3151000	3154000	The reason is that the electronic interaction here is the coolant.
3154000	3157000	The reason is that the electronic interaction here is the coolant.
3157000	3160000	So if your coolant is very strong,
3160000	3163000	it will try to split your cooper pair into different wires.
3163000	3166000	So if your coolant interaction is strong enough,
3166000	3169000	your non-local pairing will be greater than the local pairing.
3169000	3172000	your non-local pairing will be greater than the local pairing.
3172000	3175000	Before trying to achieve these topological states,
3175000	3178000	Before trying to achieve these topological states,
3178000	3181000	we would like to know that how could we reach
3181000	3184000	strong electronic interaction.
3184000	3187000	Normal, the so-called
3187000	3190000	wired electronic interaction
3190000	3192880	is described with the Tomonaga-Latinger
3192880	3195880	or Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid.
3195880	3198880	In describing its model,
3198880	3201880	we will have a parameter called Gc.
3201880	3204880	So the point is that we want to know
3204880	3207880	how much Gc we can reach.
3207880	3210880	Let's review first.
3210880	3213880	If there is no spin-over coupling,
3213880	3216880	how do we determine the value of Gc in practice?
3216880	3219880	Here I simply write this Hamiltonian.
3219880	3222880	If there is no spin-over coupling,
3222880	3225880	the so-called Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid
3225880	3228880	will look like this.
3228880	3231880	There will be some bosonic fields
3231880	3234880	to describe the physics of low energy.
3234880	3237880	The most important thing is this Gnu.
3237880	3240880	Gnu is C or S,
3240880	3243880	which is the charge or spin sector.
3243880	3246880	The most important thing is that because of the coolant interaction,
3246880	3249880	there is no spin-over coupling.
3249880	3252880	The smaller the Gc, the stronger the spin-over coupling.
3252880	3255880	So we want to know
3255880	3258880	the value of Gc in this material.
3258880	3261880	How do we know?
3261880	3264880	As you can see in the document,
3264880	3267880	if you have a Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid,
3267880	3270880	your IV curve will look like this.
3270880	3273880	This IV curve
3273880	3276880	has a so-called universal scaling behavior.
3276880	3279880	What does it mean?
3279880	3282880	If you divide both sides
3282880	3285880	by the power load of the temperature,
3285880	3288880	you will find that the right side
3288880	3291880	is only related to V divided by T.
3291880	3294880	This V is the bias voltage,
3294880	3297880	and T is the temperature.
3297880	3300880	In other words, if you draw this picture,
3300880	3303880	you will find that all the bias and all the temperature
3303880	3306880	data points are all concentrated on the same line.
3306880	3309880	This is called universal scaling.
3309880	3312880	Because this scaling is related to this α,
3312880	3315880	and this α is related to this Gc,
3315880	3318880	so if you can fit this data,
3318880	3321880	you can find out how much Gc should be.
3321880	3324880	In this way, you can know
3324880	3327880	how strong the interaction of electrons in the guide line is.
3328880	3331880	Here's an example.
3331880	3334880	Tarucha's group
3334880	3337880	uses indium arsenide as a wire.
3337880	3340880	They first get a two-deck wafer,
3340880	3343880	and then continue to convert it into a wire.
3343880	3346880	This is what Ted mentioned earlier.
3346880	3349880	If you have these wires,
3349880	3352880	they continue to measure this IV curve
3352880	3355880	with the current to the bias voltage.
3356880	3359880	Different colors represent different temperatures,
3359880	3362880	and you find that the low data is like this.
3362880	3365880	But you can rescale it.
3365880	3368880	After rescaling, you will find that all the data points
3368880	3371880	are concentrated on this line.
3371880	3374880	So this tells us that there really is
3374880	3377880	the phenomenon of the so-called Tomonaga-Rattinger liquid in this guide line.
3377880	3380880	You can get this α from this fitting.
3380880	3383880	They continue to tune
3384880	3387880	different top gate voltages.
3387880	3390880	That is, it can adjust the charge density in the guide line.
3390880	3393880	You find different densities.
3393880	3396880	The low data you get is like this.
3396880	3399880	Then you can go to fit
3399880	3402880	and find the phenomenon of universal scaling.
3402880	3405880	Their data is very beautiful.
3405880	3408880	In other words,
3408880	3411880	not only do you know that
3411880	3414880	there is universal scaling in this line,
3414880	3417880	there is Tomonaga-Rattinger liquid,
3417880	3420880	you also know that you can tune
3420880	3423880	the strength of the electron interaction.
3423880	3426880	Here is the value of their fit α
3426880	3429880	and the top gate voltage.
3429880	3432880	So the first conclusion here is that
3432880	3435880	you can have a tunable electron interaction.
3435880	3438880	The second is that your α
3438880	3441880	is about 2.5.
3441880	3444880	How do we know
3444880	3447880	what the value is when it is converted to Gc?
3447880	3450880	The most important question here is
3450880	3453880	because we know that the spin-over coupling of indium arsenide is very strong.
3453880	3456880	What we found in the file before
3456880	3459880	is that there is no spin-over coupling formula.
3459880	3462880	So we want to know that if you add spin-over coupling,
3462880	3465880	this formula will be changed.
3465880	3468880	So how do we know
3468880	3471880	what our real Gc is?
3471880	3474880	So this brings us to our research this time.
3474880	3477880	Because of the time,
3477880	3480880	I will briefly introduce it.
3480880	3483880	In the case of Bostonization,
3483880	3486880	the introduction mentioned that
3486880	3489880	you have the phenomenon of band distortion,
3489880	3492880	which is ΔV.
3492880	3495880	If you have a Hamiltonian,
3495880	3498880	it will produce a new term.
3498880	3501880	This new term is quadratic,
3501880	3504880	so you can still diagonalize it.
3504880	3507880	Then you can get the full Hamiltonian.
3507880	3510880	Because this full Hamiltonian
3510880	3513880	can still be directly solved,
3513880	3516880	we can still use it to calculate
3516880	3519880	our current or inductance.
3520880	3523880	Then we will consider two extremes.
3523880	3526880	That is, impurity,
3526880	3529880	that is, there will be different impurities in this inductance.
3529880	3532880	These impurities will cause
3532880	3535880	your electron to backscatter.
3535880	3538880	So this will affect your current or inductance.
3538880	3541880	We consider two extremes.
3541880	3544880	One is when this impurity is very strong.
3544880	3547880	If it is very strong,
3547880	3550880	there will be a tunnel barrier.
3550880	3553880	Then we find that if your tunnel barrier
3553880	3556880	is in the end of the inductance and the middle of the inductance,
3556880	3559880	you will have different scaling exponents.
3559880	3562880	So in these two different situations,
3562880	3565880	we find that
3565880	3568880	you can still get a similar form,
3568880	3571880	which is this IV curve.
3571880	3574880	It looks the same as the formula
3575880	3578880	The only difference is that this α will be changed.
3578880	3581880	Then we find that this α will be related to
3581880	3584880	where your impurity is.
3584880	3587880	Then it is also related to the bend distortion
3587880	3590880	caused by spin-orbital coupling.
3590880	3593880	This is its formula.
3593880	3596880	Let's summarize the results in this picture.
3596880	3599880	Let's summarize the results in this picture.
3599880	3602880	In this picture,
3602880	3605880	I first draw the whole exponent
3605880	3608880	without spin-orbital coupling.
3608880	3611880	It looks like this.
3611880	3614880	That is to say, the stronger your electromagnetic interaction force,
3614880	3617880	that is, Gc is close to zero,
3617880	3620880	the greater your exponent.
3620880	3623880	On the contrary, if Gc is 1,
3623880	3626880	that is, if there is no electromagnetic interaction force,
3626880	3629880	your α will become zero.
3630880	3633880	This is the effect of spin-orbital coupling.
3633880	3636880	We find that it affects
3636880	3639880	the strong electromagnetic interaction force.
3639880	3642880	In fact, this effect is very small
3642880	3645880	because it is very small compared to the original exponent.
3645880	3648880	That is to say, if there is a strong electromagnetic interaction force
3648880	3651880	in your導線,
3651880	3654880	you don't have to worry about whether spin-orbital coupling is strong or not.
3654880	3657880	Because it doesn't really affect
3658880	3661880	the opposite area.
3661880	3664880	If your electromagnetic interaction force is weak,
3664880	3667880	you will indeed see some changes.
3667880	3670880	We found that the changes here are negative.
3670880	3673880	That is to say, your exponent looks
3673880	3676880	smaller than it was without spin-orbital coupling.
3676880	3679880	So these features tell us
3679880	3682880	that when your experiment has measured
3682880	3685880	that your α is quite high value,
3685880	3688880	it can be said that your electron-electron
3688880	3691880	display is very strong.
3691880	3694880	This is our main conclusion.
3694880	3697880	Of course, we just said that we can consider different limits.
3697880	3700880	Your impurity can be very strong.
3700880	3703880	This is the conclusion we just got.
3703880	3706880	Your impurity can also be very weak.
3706880	3709880	If it is very weak, we are not tunnel barrier.
3709880	3712880	In this case, we consider a lot of
3712880	3715880	weak impurities.
3715880	3718880	Then we get a similar formula.
3718880	3721880	The difference is that the exponent will be different.
3721880	3724880	We found that if we take this exponent
3724880	3727880	to draw this picture,
3727880	3730880	we will find that the big difference
3730880	3733880	is that the exponent will only go to 1 at most.
3733880	3736880	That is, it will be limited between 0 and 1.
3736880	3739880	So the 2.5 we saw in the experiment
3739880	3742880	cannot be explained by this weak impurity.
3742880	3745880	So we can rule it out.
3745880	3748880	So we know that the exponent we saw in the experiment
3748880	3751880	is 2.5 because
3751880	3754880	there are some very strong impurities in the導線.
3754880	3757880	So we can get our conclusion here.
3757880	3760880	So let's make a summary here.
3760880	3763880	First, what we said in the introduction
3763880	3766880	is that if you have a導線
3766880	3769880	and you have a very strong spin-over coupling,
3769880	3772880	you can use it to achieve some
3772880	3775880	topological states.
3775880	3778880	The second point is that
3778880	3781880	our research shows that
3781880	3784880	you can still use the IV curve to measure the導線.
3784880	3787880	From here, you can deduce
3787880	3790880	how strong the electromagnetic interaction force
3790880	3793880	in the導線 is.
3793880	3796880	Our analysis shows that
3796880	3799880	the IV curve in the experiment
3799880	3802880	of indium arsenide
3802880	3805880	allows us to deduce that Gc is about 0.2.
3805880	3808880	So this means that the spin-over coupling
3808880	3811880	in the導線 is very strong.
3811880	3814880	We know that indium arsenide
3814880	3817880	has a very strong spin-over coupling.
3817880	3820880	Now we know that it can achieve
3820880	3823880	a very strong electromagnetic interaction force.
3823880	3826880	So if you add these two factors together,
3826880	3829880	it tells us that indium arsenide
3829880	3832880	can be used to achieve Majorna bond state.
3832880	3835880	Then you don't need to use magnetic field
3835880	3838880	to achieve Majorna bond state.
3838880	3841880	This is my speech today.
3841880	3844880	I'll pause here now
3844880	3847880	to see if you have any questions.
3851880	3854880	Do you have any questions?
3859880	3862880	Let me ask you a question first.
3862880	3865880	When you talk about α,
3865880	3868880	is it the gate voltage
3868880	3871880	of the conductance
3871880	3874880	or the source voltage?
3874880	3877880	Is it the gate voltage
3877880	3880880	or the source voltage?
3880880	3883880	Is that right?
3883880	3886880	Yes, the V in the IV curve
3886880	3889880	is the source voltage.
3889880	3892880	Can you explain a little bit?
3892880	3895880	Is there a more straightforward idea?
3895880	3898880	When α is equal to 0,
3898880	3901880	does it mean that this is a straight line?
3901880	3904880	What does α equal to 0 mean?
3904880	3907880	0 is the value of the current
3907880	3910880	in this IV curve.
3910880	3913880	Is it a straight line?
3913880	3916880	Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.
3916880	3919880	Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.
3919880	3922880	Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.
3922880	3925880	I think this is understandable.
3925880	3928880	When there is no electron-electron interaction,
3928880	3931880	you are a little bit like...
3931880	3934880	If you are an ohmic contact,
3934880	3937880	If you are an ohmic contact,
3937880	3940880	you should get an ohmic line.
3940880	3943880	you should get an ohmic line.
3943880	3946880	When there is electron-electron interaction,
3946880	3949880	what does α mean?
3949880	3952880	When your source current is high,
3952880	3955880	When your source current is high,
3955880	3958880	you will get more current.
3958880	3961880	When your source current is high,
3961880	3964880	you will get more current.
3964880	3967880	Let me see if there is a similar formula.
3967880	3970880	Let me see if there is a similar formula.
3970880	3973880	You can think like this.
3973880	3976880	Maybe I can use this.
3976880	3979880	Is there a simpler physical image?
3979880	3982880	We can think like this.
3982880	3985880	When you have an impurity at a point,
3985880	3988880	When you have an impurity at a point,
3988880	3991880	we say this is a strong impurity.
3991880	3994880	It means that your impurity is very strong,
3994880	3997880	so your conduction channel is interrupted.
3997880	4000880	so your conduction channel is interrupted.
4000880	4003880	So when you want to have current,
4003880	4006880	you have to pass this tunneling.
4006880	4009880	So you will have current.
4009880	4012880	This tunneling is equivalent to
4012880	4015880	density of states.
4015880	4018880	There will be density of states
4018880	4021880	in your conduction channel or lead.
4021880	4024880	When you have a strong interaction force,
4024880	4027880	when α is stronger,
4027880	4030880	it means that your density of states will be suppressed.
4030880	4033880	Because your density of states
4033880	4036880	can be thought of as the α-quantity of epsilon.
4036880	4039880	It is also a power law.
4039880	4042880	What is epsilon?
4042880	4045880	Epsilon is energy.
4045880	4048880	So your density of states will be written as the rho of epsilon.
4048880	4051880	So it is equivalent to
4051880	4054880	how many density of states you have
4054880	4057880	near the Fermi energy.
4057880	4060880	If there is no interaction,
4060880	4063880	this α is 0,
4063880	4066880	which means that its density of states is constant.
4066880	4069880	Because it is constant.
4069880	4072880	So you will have some density of states
4072880	4075880	to allow you to tunnel.
4075880	4078880	When your interaction force is getting stronger and stronger,
4078880	4081880	α will get bigger and bigger,
4081880	4084880	which means that the density of states
4084880	4087880	near the Fermi level will be suppressed.
4087880	4090880	Because the α-quantity of epsilon,
4090880	4093880	which means that epsilon is getting closer to 0,
4093880	4096880	its density of states will be getting smaller and smaller.
4096880	4099880	Because of this,
4099880	4102880	if you want to tunnel into
4102880	4105880	the liquid state,
4105880	4108880	it will be more and more impossible.
4108880	4111880	You can think of it this way.
4111880	4114880	So you need a higher voltage
4114880	4117880	to generate a certain current.
4117880	4120880	Yes, you can say that.
4120880	4123880	Wait, what about the experiment?
4123880	4126880	Did I read it wrong?
4138880	4141880	Ok, I think I understand what you mean.
4141880	4144880	When your voltage is high,
4144880	4147880	your differential conductance
4147880	4150880	will increase.
4150880	4153880	Yes, it will increase.
4153880	4156880	Ok, I understand.
4156880	4159880	So,
4159880	4162880	I think I wrote differential conductance
4162880	4165880	at the end.
4165880	4168880	Here, here.
4168880	4171880	Ok, so this is the definition of α.
4171880	4174880	Yes.
4174880	4177880	So the higher your V,
4177880	4180880	the higher your differential conductance.
4180880	4183880	Of course, if you have a linear response region,
4183880	4186880	your voltage will be lower.
4186880	4189880	Your power load is determined by the temperature.
4189880	4192880	Yes.
4195880	4198880	Does anyone have any questions?
4198880	4201880	Ok.
4201880	4204880	If there are no further questions,
4204880	4207880	I will turn off the recording.
4207880	4210880	You can continue to discuss
4210880	4213880	in the conference room.
4213880	4216880	Let's turn on the microphone
4216880	4219880	and give a warm round of applause
4219880	4222880	to the speakers.
4222880	4225880	Thank you for your wonderful speech.
4225880	4228880	Thank you for your wonderful speech.
4228880	4231880	Are you ready?
4231880	4234880	Please turn on your microphone
4234880	4237880	so that the speakers can hear you.
4241880	4244880	Thank you.
4244880	4247880	Thank you for your speech.
4247880	4250880	Thank you for your wonderful speech.
4250880	4253880	I will turn off the recording.
