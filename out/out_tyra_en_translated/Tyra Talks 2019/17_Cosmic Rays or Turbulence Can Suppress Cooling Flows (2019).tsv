0	6000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TaroTalk.
6000	9000	Today, we have Dr. Su Gongyi with us.
9000	11000	This is the first time I've called him that.
11000	17000	He's going to talk to us about his research in Caltech.
17000	22000	Today's topic is Cosmic Rays or Turbulence Can Suppress Cooling Flow
22000	26000	Where Thermal Heating, Momentum Injection, or Non-HGN Solutions Fail.
26000	29000	Let's get started.
30000	33000	Hello, everyone.
33000	38000	I'm going to talk about Cosmic Rays or Turbulence Can Suppress Cooling Flow.
38000	42000	This is my research in Caltech.
42000	44000	This is my co-author.
44000	46000	I'll start with the cooling flow problem.
46000	50000	In a large galaxy or galaxy cluster,
50000	55000	we usually observe very strong X-ray luminosity.
55000	58000	This means there's a lot of gas emitting a lot of energy.
58000	63000	This means there's a lot of gas emitting a lot of energy.
63000	65000	So a lot of gas is getting colder.
65000	73000	So we should expect to find a lot of cold gas in the middle of the galaxy.
73000	79000	But in fact, we can't find that much cold gas.
79000	81000	So where does that gas go?
81000	87000	The gas may be getting colder and colder.
87000	90000	And then there's a lot of stars.
90000	92000	There's a lot of star formation.
92000	94000	But on the other hand, we find that
94000	98000	these big galaxies or galaxy clusters
98000	102000	have very low star formation rates.
102000	105000	They're basically all been crunched.
105000	108000	So this tells us
108000	112000	that there must be something
112000	114000	that generates heat
114000	117000	to re-heat these gases.
117000	119000	Otherwise, based on so many
119000	123000	inferred cooling flow rates,
123000	126000	we can't consistently find
126000	130000	so little cold gas or stars.
130000	134000	So this is the problem.
134000	137000	We've observed so much cold gas,
137000	142000	but we can't find the same amount of cold gas.
142000	145000	So this tells us that there must be something
145000	147000	that can re-heat the gas.
147000	149000	In the simulation,
149000	152000	this problem is called the cooling flow problem.
152000	155000	In the simulation, the cooling flow problem
155000	158000	is most likely to generate too much star formation.
158000	162000	If you don't have any other mechanism
162000	164000	to suppress cooling flow,
164000	169000	the gases will keep cooling down
169000	172000	and accrete into the center of the galaxy
172000	175000	and generate too much star formation.
175000	177000	So you can see that this is a galaxy
177000	180000	with 14 times the solar mass
180000	182000	and has a cooling flow problem.
182000	184000	You can see that in Redshift-0,
184000	186000	the star formation rate is probably
186000	189000	more than 2 times the observed magnitude.
194000	197000	Can you hear me? Hello?
197000	200000	The cooling flow problem is typical.
200000	202000	As I said earlier,
202000	205000	it occurs in relatively heavy galaxies.
205000	209000	So you can see that this plot is stellar mass
209000	211000	versus halo mass.
211000	214000	Halo mass is the mass of dark matter.
214000	219000	The horizontal axis is the mass of stars in the galaxy.
219000	222000	If you assume that all the baryons,
222000	225000	all the gases and all the substances
225000	227000	follow the dark matter,
227000	230000	the flow follows the dark matter
230000	232000	and all of them become stars,
232000	234000	then you can predict the virtual line.
234000	236000	You can see that
236000	239000	after a very high-quality galaxy,
239000	243000	the green lines below are observed.
243000	245000	You can see that
245000	247000	in a large-scale galaxy,
247000	249000	there will be a very large deviation.
249000	252000	The larger the deviation, the more obvious it is.
252000	255000	This is where the cooling flow problem begins.
255000	258000	Usually, the scale occurs in L-star galaxies,
258000	261000	which is probably above the Milky Way-sized galaxy.
261000	264000	The cooling flow problem will become more and more serious.
264000	266000	In the literature,
266000	270000	there are some ideas that everyone proposes,
270000	276000	which can possibly suppress the cooling flow
276000	278000	and solve the cooling flow problem.
278000	280000	These proposals include
280000	282000	Stata Feedback,
282000	284000	Fully Microphysics,
284000	286000	Cosmic Ray,
286000	288000	which is the cosmic ray from the supernova,
288000	293000	which is the cosmic ray from the supernova,
293000	295000	or Morphological Quenching,
295000	296000	or AGM Feedback.
296000	298000	AGM Feedback is the feedback
298000	300000	generated by the supermassive black hole
300000	302000	in the middle of the galaxy.
302000	306000	To be more specific,
306000	308000	Stata Feedback,
308000	312000	which is more likely to be related to the cooling flow problem,
312000	315000	is Type Ionized Supernova, or AGB Wings.
315000	317000	AGB Wings is a Stata Wing,
317000	320000	which is the continuous energy generated by the galaxy.
320000	325000	It will heat up or provide momentum to the surrounding gas.
325000	327000	Type Ionized Supernova,
327000	334000	which is the supernova explosion of older stars,
335000	337000	is usually Type Ionized Supernova.
337000	339000	We care more about AGB Wings
339000	341000	or Type Ionized Supernova
341000	343000	because these galaxies,
343000	344000	as I just said,
344000	346000	these massive galaxies are usually quenched,
346000	348000	so their star formation rate is very low.
348000	354000	So very few stars are just produced.
354000	356000	Most of the stars are very old stars.
356000	357000	These older stars,
357000	360000	their Stata Wings are usually AGB Wings.
360000	365000	Type Ionized Supernova is usually Type Ionized Supernova.
365000	369000	These things can provide energy to the surrounding gas,
369000	373000	and either kick them to a place
373000	375000	that is farther away from the center of the galaxy,
375000	378000	or re-heat them.
378000	381000	Another possibility is Fluid Microphysics.
381000	385000	This includes magnetic field, conduction,
385000	388000	especially magnetic field and conduction.
388000	394000	Magnetic field can provide additional energy
394000	397000	and provide additional pressure
397000	403000	to suppress the cooling flow.
403000	406000	This is another possibility.
406000	408000	Indeed, in some parts of the galaxy,
408000	412000	we can see that the magnetic field's energy density
412000	414000	is similar to the thermal energy density
414000	416000	in Equipartition.
416000	418000	So the magnetic field is very important.
418000	420000	Another possibility is Conduction.
420000	425000	If the conduction is very strong,
425000	427000	usually the picture looks like this.
427000	432000	When gas starts to move from the universe
432000	436000	to a place where the potential of the galaxy is affected,
436000	439000	it will be shocked to a higher temperature.
439000	443000	So the higher the quality of the star,
443000	446000	the higher the temperature will be.
446000	449000	So if the conduction is very strong,
449000	454000	it can transfer the heat from the hot part
454000	457000	to the cold part in the middle,
457000	461000	and then re-heat the gas that has been cooled to the middle.
461000	465000	So conduction is also a proposed idea in the literature.
465000	469000	It is possible to solve the cooling flow problem.
469000	472000	The third one is Cosmic Current Supernova.
472000	475000	Cosmic Current is usually generated by shock.
475000	477000	Because Supernova provides a lot of energy,
477000	479000	it will shock the gas next to it,
479000	481000	and then there will be a lot of protons
481000	485000	being added at a higher speed.
485000	489000	What we are talking about here is mainly related to
489000	493000	the Cosmic Current Proton of GEV.
493000	496000	Usually 10% of Supernova Energy
496000	499000	may be generated in the form of Cosmic Current.
499000	504000	On the one hand, Cosmic Current can heat the surrounding gas.
504000	507000	There may be Streaming in the channel.
507000	510000	Streaming is when the Cosmic Current and gas
510000	513000	are not completely synchronized,
513000	516000	it will generate all kinds of instability,
516000	518000	and then through this instability,
518000	521000	it will dissipate energy and heat the surrounding gas.
521000	523000	On the other hand, there is the Hadron Collider.
523000	526000	That is, the Cosmic Current will collide with the gas,
526000	528000	and energy will be generated in this respect.
528000	530000	Then there is Pressure Support.
530000	535000	Cosmic Ray also provides extra pressure.
535000	539000	It can also suppress the cooling flow,
539000	545000	preventing the gas from moving in the middle of the star system.
545000	550000	Another proposed idea is Morphological Clutching.
550000	552000	On the one hand, we observe that
552000	560000	when the distribution of stars is relatively round,
560000	562000	the star formation rate is usually lower,
562000	565000	and the star formation rate is higher when the distribution is more disc-like.
565000	567000	But someone also proposed that
567000	570000	maybe we just need to change the distribution of the star system,
570000	572000	so that the gas can be stabilized,
572000	575000	and then it will not move in the middle of the star system,
575000	579000	and it can suppress the cooling flow,
579000	582000	suppress the speed of star formation,
582000	584000	and then solve this problem.
584000	589000	The part on the left is non-AGM feedback,
589000	597000	which is the mechanism that has nothing to do with the huge black hole in the middle of the star system.
597000	599000	On the other hand,
599000	603000	the most popular idea is AGM feedback.
604000	613000	AGM feedback is the feedback generated by the huge black hole in the middle of the star system to the surrounding gas.
613000	616000	This picture is like this.
616000	620000	When the gas continues to accrete into the black hole in the middle,
620000	628000	some of the energy will be fed back to the surrounding gas.
628000	631000	On the one hand, it may provide momentum,
631000	633000	or gas around the heating,
633000	634000	or gas around the shock,
634000	636000	and produce a lot of cosmic rays.
636000	639000	On the other hand, it may also stir those gases,
639000	642000	and then produce more turbulence,
642000	647000	and then it may also suppress the cooling flow.
647000	649000	In my next talk,
649000	656000	I will gradually say why these on the left are not important.
656000	661000	The feedback on the right is related to AGM feedback,
661000	666000	which is the feedback related to the huge black hole in the middle of the star system.
666000	668000	It may be more important,
668000	673000	especially the two aspects of cosmic rays and turbulence.
673000	676000	This is my next talk outline.
676000	679000	I will first talk about how we set up these simulations.
679000	681000	Then I will talk one by one,
681000	683000	such as Stata Feedback,
683000	684000	Fluid Microphysics,
684000	685000	Cosmic Ray,
685000	686000	Morphological Quenching,
686000	687000	and AGM Feedback.
687000	688000	I will talk one by one,
688000	691000	why each one is important or not.
691000	693000	This is the setup of the simulation.
693000	695000	We study this problem.
695000	697000	As I just said,
697000	704000	this problem is usually more important in galaxies with a quality higher than L-star galaxy.
704000	709000	L-star galaxy is probably the Milky Way-sized galaxy.
709000	712000	Its solar mass is about 10 to 12 quadrilaterals.
712000	714000	We have tried three cases,
714000	715000	10 to 12 quadrilaterals,
715000	716000	10 to 13 quadrilaterals,
716000	717000	and 10 to 14 quadrilaterals.
717000	720000	We use Idealized Isolated Galaxy Simulation.
720000	723000	We made our own galaxy,
723000	725000	and then we started from an initial condition.
725000	728000	Then we add different feedback,
728000	730000	or as I just said,
730000	731000	those physics go in,
731000	736000	and then our initial condition is the initial condition based on observation.
736000	740000	If you don't have any mechanism to suppress the cooling flow problem,
740000	743000	the cooling flow problem will occur.
743000	746000	As shown in the previous picture,
746000	748000	there will be too much star formation.
748000	751000	So if you let the initial condition evolve,
751000	754000	it will soon be inconsistent with the observation.
754000	756000	We use this initial condition,
756000	760000	and then we add the static feedback,
760000	761000	free microphysics,
761000	762000	and AGM feedback.
762000	767000	We try to see if there is any way to maintain it in the simulation,
767000	770000	to maintain it in line with the observation.
770000	773000	The cooling flow will not be too strong,
773000	776000	and there will not be too many stars.
776000	778000	In our initial condition,
778000	780000	we have pre-set,
780000	781000	and based on the observation,
781000	784000	we manually set the Dark Matter Halo,
784000	785000	the star,
785000	786000	the Static Disk,
786000	787000	the Static Bulge,
787000	788000	and the Gas Disk.
789000	793000	This is the gas around the star,
793000	796000	and we have a pressure-supported Hot Halo,
796000	799000	which is the entire star,
799000	802000	this huge amount of star,
802000	806000	there will be a gas Halo covering the entire galaxy,
806000	808000	the entire galaxy.
808000	812000	Basically, it should be pressure-supported,
813000	818000	the pressure compensates the gravitational force,
818000	821000	and it should be a pressure-supported Hot Halo,
821000	822000	this is our initial condition.
822000	824000	The picture on the right shows that
824000	827000	the axis on the left is X-ray Luminosity,
827000	829000	and the axis on the right is Halo Mass.
829000	835000	These three black dots are our initial conditions.
835000	836000	You can see that
836000	845000	the X-ray Luminosity is based on the observed data.
850000	851000	In our simulation,
851000	852000	we use Gizmo,
852000	854000	which has gravity,
854000	857000	and all kinds of feedback are already in there,
857000	861000	and there will be a Hydro Code.
861000	864000	As for the Star Feedback,
864000	866000	we use the FIRE Star Feedback Model,
866000	872000	which is a very good Star Feedback Model.
872000	876000	It includes Supernova,
876000	877000	Star Winds,
877000	878000	Photonization,
878000	879000	Photoelectric Heating,
879000	881000	and Radiational Pressure.
881000	884000	For the cooling of the gas,
884000	888000	we follow it from 10K to 12-14K,
888000	892000	so the gas can cool from 12-14K to 10K.
893000	896000	We use different cooling methods to cool the gas.
896000	898000	As for the Star Formation,
898000	901000	when the gas cools and becomes dense,
901000	902000	it can produce stars.
902000	907000	We only allow the gas to meet the following conditions.
907000	912000	The gas must be self-gravitating and molecular,
912000	918000	and its density must be greater than 100 particles per cubic centimeter,
918000	922000	so that it can produce stars.
922000	924000	As for Cosmic Ray,
924000	930000	we model it as an extra fluid,
930000	935000	assuming that it is in line with the flow of the Hydro Code,
935000	938000	and we try to model it as GEV Cosmic Ray.
938000	940000	Cosmic Ray can do some things,
940000	942000	such as PDP work,
943000	945000	which means that it will have pressure
945000	948000	and will make contact with other gases.
948000	955000	It will diffuse to the surroundings,
955000	958000	and it will have a relative movement with the gas,
958000	961000	which will produce various kinds of stability,
961000	963000	and will lose some energy,
963000	965000	and heat up these gases.
965000	968000	Similarly, it will collide with the gas,
969000	971000	and it will heat up those gases,
971000	973000	and it will lose Cosmic Ray energy,
973000	977000	but it will provide heat energy to the gas.
977000	980000	First, let's talk about Static Feedback.
980000	983000	Is Static Feedback useful for cooling flow problems?
983000	987000	As we said, we have 12 quadrants, 13 quadrants, 14 quadrants,
987000	989000	and three different runs.
989000	994000	We usually enable M12, M13, and M14.
995000	999000	We have two different simulations for M12 and M13.
999000	1001000	The first one is Default Run,
1001000	1003000	which has FIRE Static Feedback,
1003000	1005000	which also includes Static Feedback.
1005000	1007000	The other one is No Feedback Run,
1007000	1009000	which has no Static Feedback.
1009000	1014000	As we said, in Static Feedback,
1014000	1016000	we believe that Type Ionized Supernova
1016000	1018000	and AGB Wink are more important,
1018000	1019000	so we added more.
1019000	1020000	In addition to Default Run,
1020000	1022000	which has Static Feedback and No Feedback Run,
1022000	1024000	we also have Type Ionized Supernova Run.
1024000	1027000	We only enable Type Ionized Supernova.
1027000	1031000	Static Feedback has various channels,
1031000	1034000	so we only enable Type Ionized Supernova in this run.
1034000	1037000	In the other run, we only enable AGB Wink.
1037000	1042000	Then we start running from Initial Condition
1042000	1045000	based on the relative situation.
1045000	1047000	Let's see what the result is.
1047000	1048000	This is the result.
1048000	1053000	This is the result based on the situation mentioned above.
1053000	1055000	The result is the star formation rate,
1055000	1057000	which is the speed of the star formation.
1057000	1061000	You can see that the biggest difference is the black line.
1061000	1066000	The black line is the run with all Static Feedback.
1066000	1069000	The red line has no Static Feedback,
1069000	1072000	which means there is no Static Feedback at all.
1072000	1075000	The difference between the two is mainly in the beginning.
1075000	1077000	Without Static Feedback,
1077000	1080000	the gas stored in the center of the star will cool down very quickly
1080000	1084000	and then explore the center of the star
1084000	1086000	and produce too many stars.
1086000	1091000	You can see that there is a very high star formation rate at the beginning.
1091000	1094000	After the gas in the middle is gradually used up,
1094000	1098000	the remaining star formation is
1098000	1102000	then from the gas at a further distance from the beginning
1102000	1104000	to the cooling flow
1104000	1108000	and then cool down to the center of the gas to produce stars.
1108000	1111000	You can see that even though Static Feedback
1111000	1114000	suppressed the star formation rate at the beginning,
1114000	1116000	but later, at the end of the simulation,
1116000	1118000	you can see that in all the runs,
1118000	1121000	the star formation rate is still very high,
1121000	1126000	from several solar max per year to dozens of solar max per year.
1126000	1129000	It can't completely solve the cooling flow problem.
1129000	1132000	It still produces too many stars.
1132000	1139000	Can you talk about the nominal observational rate you want to get?
1139000	1146000	Generally, a crunched galaxy can be suppressed to 10 to 0,
1146000	1149000	which is less than one solar max per year,
1149000	1154000	especially a 14-dimensional or larger galaxy.
1154000	1159000	But dozens of solar max per year is definitely too high.
1163000	1165000	Okay, go ahead.
1167000	1172000	So Static Feedback can't solve the cooling flow problem.
1172000	1175000	In all the runs, you can see that
1175000	1178000	at the end of the simulation,
1178000	1184000	the star formation rate of Static Feedback is getting smaller and smaller.
1184000	1188000	And no matter what, it still produces more than 10,
1188000	1190000	especially in more massive galaxies,
1190000	1195000	which are more than 10 to 14 solar max per year.
1195000	1197000	On the other hand, you can see that
1197000	1199000	only the run of Type Ion and Supernova
1199000	1201000	and only the run of AGB Wind,
1201000	1204000	which is the red line and the light blue line,
1204000	1207000	in the case of 14 dimensions,
1207000	1209000	the star formation history,
1209000	1211000	the process of star formation,
1211000	1213000	is basically the same as without feedback.
1213000	1217000	In other words, the contribution of Type Ion, Supernova, and AGB Wind is very small.
1217000	1219000	Why is that?
1219000	1221000	On the other hand,
1221000	1223000	we are trying to quantify
1223000	1225000	how many variables,
1225000	1227000	which are not documented,
1227000	1231000	are in the middle of the galaxy.
1231000	1234000	So the first line is quantified,
1234000	1237000	which is the Baryonic mass in the middle of the galaxy,
1237000	1240000	and its evolution over time.
1240000	1242000	You can see that
1242000	1244000	all the Baryonic mass changes over time
1244000	1246000	in the 30-kpc sphere,
1246000	1252000	in the 30-kpc sphere in the middle of the galaxy.
1252000	1254000	You can see that it goes up, of course.
1254000	1256000	If there is no stellar feedback,
1256000	1258000	you can see that the Baryonic mass
1258000	1260000	basically has no change in its evolution.
1260000	1262000	There are still so many gas,
1262000	1264000	so many baryons,
1264000	1266000	floating in the middle of the galaxy,
1266000	1268000	which is constantly rising.
1268000	1270000	Its rate of rise has not changed,
1270000	1272000	regardless of whether you have stellar feedback.
1272000	1274000	On the other hand,
1274000	1276000	we can see that the second line is quantified,
1276000	1278000	which is the hot gas,
1278000	1280000	which is the hotter gas,
1280000	1282000	over all the Baryonic mass.
1282000	1284000	What is the ratio?
1284000	1286000	You can see that
1286000	1288000	there is no stellar feedback,
1288000	1290000	and its hot gas
1290000	1292000	basically has no change.
1292000	1294000	The third line is changed.
1294000	1296000	The third line is cold gas or Baryonic mass,
1296000	1298000	which is the cold gas
1298000	1300000	in the Baryonic mass.
1300000	1302000	You can see that
1302000	1304000	there is no stellar feedback.
1304000	1306000	Basically, very little gas
1306000	1308000	is in the cold gas phase.
1308000	1310000	Its ratio is very low.
1310000	1312000	What happens?
1312000	1314000	When the gas cools down,
1314000	1316000	if there is no stellar feedback,
1316000	1318000	it will quickly turn into a star.
1318000	1320000	Then you will have too many stars.
1320000	1322000	But this also shows that
1322000	1324000	your stellar feedback
1324000	1326000	basically changes
1326000	1328000	how much cold gas
1328000	1330000	turns into a star,
1330000	1332000	but it does not change
1332000	1334000	how much hot gas,
1334000	1336000	and it does not change
1336000	1338000	the total Baryons
1338000	1340000	in the middle of the galaxy.
1340000	1342000	So you didn't solve the cooling flow problem.
1342000	1344000	You just changed
1344000	1346000	the ratio between the cold gas
1346000	1348000	and the stars.
1348000	1350000	You didn't change
1350000	1352000	the Baryons
1352000	1354000	in the middle of the galaxy.
1354000	1356000	So you didn't solve the cooling flow problem.
1356000	1358000	Why is
1358000	1360000	the cooling stellar feedback
1360000	1362000	not efficient?
1362000	1364000	Here we use
1364000	1366000	the M14 galaxy
1366000	1368000	to explain.
1368000	1370000	In the upper left corner,
1370000	1372000	we plot the
1372000	1374000	total cooling rate
1374000	1376000	as a function of time.
1376000	1378000	In the upper right corner,
1378000	1380000	we plot the total energy input,
1380000	1382000	which is the energy provided by stellar feedback.
1382000	1384000	You can see that
1384000	1386000	all the energy provided by stellar feedback
1386000	1388000	is not enough
1388000	1390000	to compensate for the cooling.
1390000	1392000	The stellar feedback
1392000	1394000	is to provide energy
1394000	1396000	to either move the gas farther away,
1396000	1398000	or provide the surrounding gas
1398000	1400000	in the form of motion or heat.
1400000	1402000	But the gas loses energy
1402000	1404000	with a greater rate,
1404000	1406000	and the cooling rate is always higher.
1406000	1408000	So in this situation,
1408000	1410000	stellar feedback cannot provide
1410000	1412000	enough energy to compensate
1412000	1414000	for the cooling.
1414000	1416000	So the cooling flow problem will continue to occur.
1416000	1418000	But if you try to quantify
1418000	1420000	how much energy
1420000	1422000	all kinds of stellar feedback contribute,
1422000	1424000	in the lower panel,
1424000	1426000	the lower left corner is the energy
1426000	1428000	contributed by Supernova,
1428000	1430000	and the lower right corner is the energy
1430000	1432000	contributed by Stellar Wind.
1432000	1434000	The first line corresponds to
1434000	1436000	the energy produced by younger stars.
1436000	1438000	The second line corresponds to
1438000	1440000	the energy produced by older stars.
1440000	1442000	As you can see,
1442000	1444000	because stellar feedback
1444000	1446000	does not fundamentally solve
1446000	1448000	the cooling flow problem,
1448000	1450000	the star condition is still very high.
1450000	1452000	So the most energy
1452000	1454000	in this simulation
1454000	1456000	is still the energy
1456000	1458000	generated by the supernova explosion
1458000	1460000	of younger stars.
1460000	1462000	So this is still the maximum energy.
1462000	1464000	But even if you have
1464000	1466000	so many young supernova explosions,
1466000	1468000	the energy generated
1468000	1470000	is still far less than the cooling rate.
1470000	1472000	Because
1472000	1474000	the energy generated by
1474000	1476000	those older stars is
1476000	1478000	not only Type Ia Supernova,
1478000	1480000	but also AgV Wind.
1480000	1482000	So it is impossible
1482000	1484000	for Type Ia Supernova
1484000	1486000	and AgV Wind
1486000	1488000	to have too much influence
1488000	1490000	on the cooling flow.
1490000	1492000	This also explains why
1492000	1494000	we only run Type Ia Supernova
1494000	1496000	and AgV Wind.
1496000	1498000	The star condition history
1498000	1500000	is basically the same
1500000	1502000	without any feedback.
1502000	1504000	I have a question.
1516000	1518000	Hello?
1518000	1520000	Hello?
1520000	1522000	Hello?
1522000	1524000	I can't hear you.
1524000	1526000	What's wrong?
1528000	1530000	Hello?
1530000	1532000	Hello?
1532000	1534000	I can hear you.
1534000	1536000	How are you?
1536000	1538000	Hello?
1538000	1540000	I just cut off.
1540000	1542000	Sorry. Can you hear me?
1542000	1544000	I can hear you.
1544000	1546000	There are some spikes on the two curves.
1546000	1548000	The spikes are actually very large.
1548000	1550000	The spikes on the log scale are bulging like this.
1550000	1552000	What is that?
1552000	1554000	Do you know the other three lines below?
1554000	1556000	Which spikes are you talking about?
1556000	1558000	The two lines
1558000	1560000	in the upper left panel
1560000	1562000	are the default
1562000	1564000	and low metallicity.
1564000	1566000	Default
1566000	1568000	and low metallicity.
1568000	1570000	So the cooling rate is...
1570000	1572000	I'm talking about those
1572000	1574000	small edges.
1574000	1576000	It's not that large.
1576000	1578000	It's just that
1578000	1580000	there are some fluctuations
1580000	1582000	based on the gas
1582000	1584000	at that time.
1584000	1586000	So it's not a special event.
1586000	1588000	You think it's just
1588000	1590000	a normal fluctuation.
1590000	1592000	Yeah, I think it's normal.
1592000	1594000	I didn't look closely.
1594000	1596000	It's probably the same as my average time scale.
1596000	1598000	But yeah, it's probably just...
1598000	1600000	Oh, okay.
1600000	1602000	I thought it was a special event.
1602000	1604000	And the other three are not.
1604000	1606000	No, I think it's okay.
1606000	1608000	Okay, okay.
1608000	1610000	Okay, thank you.
1610000	1612000	Yeah, those two
1612000	1614000	have a complete set of feedback.
1614000	1616000	Maybe it's just that time.
1616000	1618000	The set of feedback is a little stronger.
1618000	1620000	Or there's some gas
1620000	1622000	that's denser, and the cooling rate is stronger.
1622000	1624000	I didn't look closely.
1624000	1626000	But I think it's okay.
1626000	1628000	It's not that big.
1628000	1630000	Usually, there are some fluctuations at the scene.
1630000	1632000	That's another question.
1632000	1634000	The set of feedback is another question.
1634000	1636000	It may actually provide energy
1636000	1638000	to the Galaxy
1638000	1640000	to reheat the gas.
1640000	1642000	But in fact,
1642000	1644000	it also produces a lot of metal.
1644000	1646000	In astronomy, when we say metal,
1646000	1648000	we mean any element
1648000	1650000	greater than helium.
1650000	1652000	Any element greater than helium.
1652000	1654000	Because the set of feedback
1654000	1656000	produces a lot of heavier elements.
1656000	1658000	These heavier elements
1658000	1660000	can make the cooling rate
1660000	1662000	cooler.
1662000	1664000	It makes the gas easier to cool.
1664000	1666000	On the left,
1666000	1668000	we see two lines.
1668000	1670000	One line is the default run.
1670000	1672000	It's a normal run.
1672000	1674000	The other line is where we deliberately
1674000	1676000	put its heavier elements
1676000	1678000	in the Galaxy.
1678000	1680000	It's very, very low.
1680000	1682000	You can see if there's any of these metals.
1682000	1684000	Its star formation rate
1684000	1686000	can actually be quite different.
1686000	1688000	So,
1688000	1690000	these metals are basically
1690000	1692000	consistently from the set of feedback.
1692000	1694000	So, we can say that
1694000	1696000	the set of feedback
1696000	1698000	is basically possible to
1698000	1700000	make the cooling flow problem
1700000	1702000	worse.
1702000	1704000	Because these heavier elements
1704000	1706000	induce the gas to cool down.
1706000	1708000	So, the set of feedback doesn't work.
1708000	1710000	Let's look at magnetic field conduction
1710000	1712000	in Cosmic Graviton Supernova.
1712000	1714000	So,
1714000	1716000	let's look at these heavy elements one by one.
1716000	1718000	In the case of 10, 12, and 13,
1718000	1720000	we have a default run.
1720000	1722000	It has a fire set of feedback.
1722000	1724000	It only has a fire set of feedback.
1724000	1726000	It doesn't have any other fully microphysics.
1726000	1728000	We also have another all-microphysics run.
1728000	1730000	It has a fire set of feedback,
1730000	1732000	magnetic field, conduction, and viscosity.
1732000	1734000	In the Galaxy of 10, 12, and 14,
1734000	1736000	in addition to the default
1736000	1738000	and all-microphysics run,
1738000	1740000	we have another run,
1740000	1742000	which is all-microphysics plus Supernova.
1742000	1744000	In addition to the all-microphysics run,
1744000	1746000	we have a fire set of feedback,
1746000	1748000	magnetic field, conduction,
1748000	1750000	and viscosity.
1750000	1752000	We also have 10% of Supernova energy
1752000	1754000	in Cosmic Graviton.
1758000	1760000	I have a question about
1760000	1762000	Supernova.
1762000	1764000	I'm actually very surprised
1764000	1766000	that this is a hypothesis.
1766000	1768000	Because this can be estimated,
1768000	1770000	right?
1770000	1772000	If you observe the rate,
1772000	1774000	you can estimate the energy budget.
1774000	1776000	You can see the luminosity
1776000	1778000	and know the rate.
1778000	1780000	Can you estimate the energy budget
1780000	1782000	to solve this problem?
1782000	1784000	Or is it just a qualitative
1784000	1786000	possibility?
1786000	1788000	When we were doing this project,
1788000	1790000	we basically believed
1790000	1792000	that this was impossible to solve.
1792000	1794000	Some papers
1794000	1796000	tried to propose
1796000	1798000	that Supernova
1798000	1800000	had enough energy.
1800000	1802000	Their approach was
1802000	1804000	to compare the total cooling rate
1804000	1806000	in the center of the star
1806000	1808000	with the energy input
1808000	1810000	of the stellar feedback.
1810000	1812000	They found that
1812000	1814000	the stellar feedback
1814000	1816000	had enough energy.
1816000	1818000	But our point is
1818000	1820000	that even in the very,
1820000	1822000	very middle part,
1822000	1824000	it's possible that it's enough.
1824000	1826000	In fact, the gas
1826000	1828000	next to it is very, very large.
1828000	1830000	In the outer part,
1830000	1832000	the gas will continue to cool
1832000	1834000	and go to the center of the star.
1834000	1836000	But your star is only
1836000	1838000	in the center of the halo.
1838000	1840000	So you should calculate
1840000	1842000	the entire cooling rate
1842000	1844000	of the entire halo,
1844000	1846000	not the cooling rate
1846000	1848000	where the star is distributed.
1848000	1850000	Because you are
1850000	1852000	highly biased to
1852000	1854000	this kind of very, very localized
1854000	1856000	calculation.
1856000	1858000	Their estimate
1858000	1860000	is that
1860000	1862000	the energy input
1862000	1864000	and cooling rate
1864000	1866000	in the center of the star
1866000	1868000	will continue to cool
1868000	1870000	and go to the center of the star.
1870000	1872000	So you should compare
1872000	1874000	the entire cooling gas.
1874000	1876000	We think that
1876000	1878000	this is not enough.
1878000	1880000	And our simulation
1880000	1882000	can't solve this problem.
1882000	1884000	Okay, you go on.
1884000	1886000	It depends on how you solve it.
1886000	1888000	Thank you.
1888000	1890000	So here we have
1890000	1892000	magnetic field conduction
1892000	1894000	with viscosity and cosmic ray.
1894000	1896000	This is the star
1896000	1898000	we simulated.
1898000	1900000	Is there any magnetic field?
1900000	1902000	The black line
1902000	1904000	has no magnetic field conduction,
1904000	1906000	and the blue line
1906000	1908000	has magnetic field conduction.
1908000	1910000	In the smaller galaxy,
1910000	1912000	there is magnetic field
1912000	1914000	conduction.
1914000	1916000	You can see that
1916000	1918000	the star condition
1918000	1920000	is a little less,
1920000	1922000	but only a little.
1922000	1924000	With cosmic ray,
1924000	1926000	the star condition
1926000	1928000	is slightly reduced,
1928000	1930000	but it is the same.
1930000	1932000	As time goes by,
1932000	1934000	you can see that
1934000	1936000	in the later time,
1936000	1938000	the star condition
1938000	1940000	is basically the same
1940000	1942000	as without cosmic ray.
1944000	1946000	If you continue to quantify
1946000	1948000	how much gas
1948000	1950000	is in the middle of the galaxy,
1950000	1952000	the bottom line is
1952000	1954000	total baryonic mass as a function of time,
1954000	1956000	and the top line is
1956000	1958000	hot gas mass over baryonic mass.
1958000	1960000	You can see that
1960000	1962000	with magnetic field conduction,
1962000	1964000	it is possible that
1964000	1966000	the total baryonic mass
1966000	1968000	in the middle of the galaxy
1968000	1970000	may be slightly suppressed
1970000	1972000	by magnetic field conduction,
1972000	1974000	but it is not
1974000	1976000	the difference between
1976000	1978000	the two.
1978000	1980000	There is no way to
1980000	1982000	solve this problem.
1982000	1984000	With cosmic ray,
1984000	1986000	you can see that
1986000	1988000	the gas in the middle
1988000	1990000	is slightly heated,
1990000	1992000	but it is not
1992000	1994000	the difference between
1994000	1996000	baryonic mass and
1996000	1998000	baryonic mass.
1998000	2000000	Basically,
2000000	2002000	you can't solve
2002000	2004000	this problem.
2004000	2006000	Why can't we solve
2006000	2008000	this problem?
2008000	2010000	We have seen the
2010000	2012000	results of the simulator.
2012000	2014000	The energy per unit mass
2014000	2016000	is in different energies.
2016000	2018000	The red line is thermal energy,
2018000	2020000	the blue line is magnetic energy,
2020000	2022000	the black line is turbulent energy,
2022000	2024000	and the blue line is
2024000	2026000	the energy distribution
2026000	2028000	as a function of radius,
2028000	2030000	which is how far
2030000	2032000	the energy distribution
2032000	2034000	is from the center of the galaxy.
2034000	2036000	The first line is the energy distribution,
2036000	2038000	and the second line is
2038000	2040000	the energy distribution
2040000	2042000	over thermal energy,
2042000	2044000	which is how important
2044000	2046000	it is compared to thermal energy.
2046000	2048000	You can see that
2048000	2050000	in most of the radius,
2050000	2052000	the energy distribution
2052000	2054000	is much smaller than
2054000	2056000	thermal energy.
2056000	2058000	The energy distribution
2058000	2060000	in the middle
2060000	2062000	is not so different,
2062000	2064000	but in the cooling flow
2064000	2066000	area,
2066000	2068000	the energy distribution
2068000	2070000	is much smaller
2070000	2072000	than thermal energy.
2072000	2074000	This limit
2074000	2076000	can't affect
2076000	2078000	the cooling flow
2078000	2080000	in the cooling area.
2080000	2082000	Why doesn't conduction
2082000	2084000	affect the cooling flow?
2084000	2086000	On the one hand,
2086000	2088000	some of the reasons are
2088000	2090000	that conduction
2090000	2092000	is heat transfer
2092000	2094000	and it depends on
2094000	2096000	the direction of
2096000	2098000	the temperature gradient.
2098000	2100000	But basically,
2100000	2102000	the particles with heat
2102000	2104000	are all charged particles,
2104000	2106000	so they are trapped
2106000	2108000	in the direction of the magnetic field.
2108000	2110000	So basically,
2110000	2112000	if you want the thermal gradient
2112000	2114000	to be in one direction
2114000	2116000	and the magnetic field
2116000	2118000	to be in the other direction,
2118000	2120000	the direction of the conduction
2120000	2122000	will be projected
2122000	2124000	to the direction of the magnetic field.
2124000	2126000	This projection
2126000	2128000	will reduce
2128000	2130000	the effective conductivity.
2130000	2132000	Let's estimate
2132000	2134000	how much this reduction
2134000	2136000	is.
2136000	2138000	The middle part
2138000	2140000	reduces the effective conductivity
2140000	2142000	by at least half,
2142000	2144000	and the outer part
2144000	2146000	reduces it by 1 or more thirds.
2146000	2148000	So this is one way
2148000	2150000	to explain why
2150000	2152000	the conduction
2152000	2154000	is not very important
2154000	2156000	in our simulation.
2156000	2158000	Let's talk about
2158000	2160000	the morphological environment.
2160000	2162000	For some people,
2162000	2164000	the distribution from
2164000	2166000	a disc to a boat
2166000	2168000	is a more elliptical distribution,
2168000	2170000	so the gas is stabilized
2170000	2172000	and you don't have
2172000	2174000	too many stars.
2174000	2176000	In our simulation,
2176000	2178000	we directly change
2178000	2180000	the distribution of stars
2180000	2182000	in the initial condition.
2182000	2184000	The black line and the gray line
2184000	2186000	have feedback run,
2186000	2188000	and the black line is
2188000	2190000	the normal distribution.
2190000	2192000	The gray line is
2192000	2194000	the elliptical distribution.
2194000	2196000	We also try
2196000	2198000	the no feedback run,
2198000	2200000	which is the red line
2200000	2202000	and the peach red line.
2202000	2204000	We also change the distribution
2204000	2206000	of stars.
2206000	2208000	You can see that
2208000	2210000	if you slightly change the distribution of stars,
2210000	2212000	you can slightly change
2212000	2214000	the initial
2214000	2216000	start of the simulation.
2216000	2218000	But at the end of the simulation,
2218000	2220000	all the run
2220000	2222000	are saturated
2222000	2224000	to a very high level.
2224000	2226000	Basically, you just change
2226000	2228000	the distribution of stars
2228000	2230000	without changing the
2230000	2232000	final start of the simulation.
2232000	2234000	But why is this
2234000	2236000	not important?
2236000	2238000	There is no way to solve this problem.
2238000	2240000	Basically,
2240000	2242000	it depends on whether
2242000	2244000	your gas is stabilized
2244000	2246000	or it will continue to
2246000	2248000	become denser
2248000	2250000	and generate stars.
2250000	2252000	Basically, we often estimate
2252000	2254000	a rotationally supported gas.
2254000	2256000	We estimate its thermal Q.
2256000	2258000	This is Scale S.
2258000	2260000	Omega is its angular velocity,
2260000	2262000	and the sigma of the mole
2262000	2264000	is its surface density,
2264000	2266000	which is the density of the unit area.
2266000	2268000	Usually, if this number
2268000	2270000	is less than 1,
2270000	2272000	it means that
2272000	2274000	its density is relatively zero.
2274000	2276000	If this number is greater than 1,
2276000	2278000	it means that
2278000	2280000	it will continue to expand
2280000	2282000	and generate more density
2282000	2284000	and generate stars.
2284000	2286000	If this number is greater than 1,
2286000	2288000	it means that
2288000	2290000	it is a relatively stable situation.
2290000	2292000	You can see that
2292000	2294000	if you keep changing the distribution
2294000	2296000	of stars,
2296000	2298000	if you change the shape
2298000	2300000	of the same quality star
2300000	2302000	slightly,
2302000	2304000	the result is that
2304000	2306000	you slightly change its angular velocity.
2306000	2308000	You can imagine that some stars are
2308000	2310000	distributed in the shape of a circle or a disk.
2310000	2312000	The gravitational potential will change slightly,
2312000	2314000	but you only slightly change
2314000	2316000	the effect of
2316000	2318000	the order of unity.
2318000	2320000	However, your cooling flow
2320000	2322000	provides more gas
2322000	2324000	to the center of the star.
2324000	2326000	Basically, you can do
2326000	2328000	the surface density,
2328000	2330000	which is the density of the unit area.
2330000	2332000	If you keep changing the distribution of stars,
2332000	2334000	it means that
2334000	2336000	you will change the order of unity,
2336000	2338000	because your cooling flow
2338000	2340000	will continue to put more gas
2340000	2342000	into the center of the star.
2342000	2344000	So eventually,
2344000	2346000	although you can slightly reduce
2346000	2348000	the distribution of stars,
2348000	2350000	your cooling flow will
2350000	2352000	make the distribution of stars
2352000	2354000	bigger and bigger.
2354000	2356000	So eventually,
2356000	2358000	the total Q is always less than 1.
2358000	2360000	I have a question.
2360000	2362000	In these two simulations,
2362000	2364000	you only changed the distribution
2364000	2366000	of baryonic stars, right?
2366000	2368000	Yes, I only changed the distribution
2368000	2370000	of stars.
2370000	2372000	So you didn't change
2372000	2374000	the dark matter halo, right?
2374000	2376000	No, I didn't change the dark matter.
2376000	2378000	But for example,
2378000	2380000	the disk galaxy and the circular one,
2380000	2382000	the reason why they become like this,
2382000	2384000	their mechanism...
2384000	2386000	But this is a proposed idea.
2386000	2388000	He said that
2388000	2390000	the difference in the distribution of stars
2390000	2392000	causes the cooling flow problem.
2392000	2394000	But I tell you that
2394000	2396000	although you observe
2396000	2398000	the disk galaxy,
2398000	2400000	its star formation rate is higher,
2400000	2402000	its bulge galaxy,
2402000	2404000	its star formation rate is lower,
2404000	2406000	but this correlation
2406000	2408000	is not causal.
2408000	2410000	It's not that you just have to change
2410000	2412000	the distribution of stars,
2412000	2414000	you can change the star formation.
2414000	2416000	Oh, okay.
2416000	2418000	So logically, I can accept it.
2418000	2420000	But this is what I think.
2420000	2422000	If the galaxy morphology
2422000	2424000	is different today
2424000	2426000	because its dark matter halo is different,
2426000	2428000	if you want to study
2428000	2430000	such a mechanism,
2430000	2432000	shouldn't you also change the halo?
2432000	2434000	Although I don't know what the halo looks like,
2434000	2436000	is it possible?
2436000	2438000	It's possible because of the halo.
2438000	2440000	Or even because, for example,
2440000	2442000	your AGM feedback,
2442000	2444000	the K-dome around you,
2444000	2446000	the feedback generated by the surrounding gas
2446000	2448000	caused the change,
2448000	2450000	or the merger,
2450000	2452000	or the change caused by two stars
2452000	2454000	together.
2454000	2456000	Now, no matter why
2456000	2458000	the distribution of stars
2458000	2460000	is like this,
2460000	2462000	we can't directly solve
2462000	2464000	the distribution of stars,
2464000	2466000	and we can't change
2466000	2468000	the star formation rate.
2468000	2470000	We have to prove that this logic is not true.
2470000	2472000	I agree with this conclusion.
2472000	2474000	Okay, thank you.
2474000	2476000	If you directly put in
2476000	2478000	some numbers,
2478000	2480000	you only need
2480000	2482000	about 3 x 10 to the power of 14 solar mass
2482000	2484000	in the middle of 10 kVc.
2484000	2486000	The gas surface density
2486000	2488000	will be high enough
2488000	2490000	to self-shield.
2490000	2492000	The surrounding gas will not be affected
2492000	2494000	by other radiation,
2494000	2496000	and it can cool down to a very low temperature
2496000	2498000	of 10 to the power of 14 kVc.
2498000	2500000	If you put these numbers in,
2500000	2502000	you can get a much lower temperature
2502000	2504000	of 10 to the power of 14 kVc.
2504000	2506000	These numbers are very easy to achieve,
2506000	2508000	so eventually your gas
2508000	2510000	will become very dense
2510000	2512000	and continue to flow
2512000	2514000	into the middle of the galaxy
2514000	2516000	without solving any problems.
2516000	2518000	Okay, so we've talked about
2518000	2520000	all the mechanisms
2520000	2522000	that are not AGM feedback
2522000	2524000	proposed in the literature.
2524000	2526000	In this regard, we talked about
2526000	2528000	Static Feedback, Magnetic Field Conduction,
2528000	2530000	Cosmic Reverse Supernova,
2530000	2532000	and Nucleophage Quenching.
2532000	2534000	I believe I just
2534000	2536000	tried to convince everyone that
2536000	2538000	none of them can work.
2538000	2540000	They all still have cooling flow problems.
2540000	2542000	Their gas transformation rates are still too high.
2542000	2544000	Eventually,
2544000	2546000	they are still the same
2546000	2548000	and not the same as observations.
2548000	2550000	So none of them work.
2550000	2552000	Next, let's move on to AGM feedback.
2552000	2554000	AGM feedback is
2554000	2556000	the feedback of a huge black hole
2556000	2558000	in the middle of the galaxy
2558000	2560000	to the gas around it.
2560000	2562000	A complete AGM feedback model
2562000	2564000	should be able to consistently
2564000	2566000	model how much gas
2566000	2568000	runs to the black hole
2568000	2570000	in the middle,
2570000	2572000	and how much energy
2572000	2574000	is fed to the gas around it.
2574000	2576000	But it is very
2576000	2578000	model-dependent.
2578000	2580000	Instead of
2580000	2582000	jumping directly
2582000	2584000	into a model
2584000	2586000	we believe in,
2586000	2588000	we try to do a bigger
2588000	2590000	parameter search.
2590000	2592000	We don't care
2592000	2594000	how much gas
2594000	2596000	or stars
2596000	2598000	run to the black hole
2598000	2600000	in the middle of the galaxy.
2600000	2602000	We only care about
2602000	2604000	the gas around the black hole.
2604000	2606000	For example,
2606000	2608000	if we add different
2608000	2610000	types of energy
2610000	2612000	to the black hole,
2612000	2614000	what will happen to the gas
2614000	2616000	around the black hole?
2616000	2618000	Basically,
2618000	2620000	we inject energy
2620000	2622000	from the black hole
2622000	2624000	in different forms
2624000	2626000	and intensities
2626000	2628000	to different radii
2628000	2630000	to see if there is
2630000	2632000	a scenario
2632000	2634000	where we can
2634000	2636000	suppress the star formation rate
2636000	2638000	and quench the galaxy.
2638000	2640000	If the galaxy is successfully quenched,
2640000	2642000	does it mean that
2642000	2644000	the energy produced
2644000	2646000	in the galaxy
2646000	2648000	is equivalent to
2648000	2650000	the energy produced
2650000	2652000	in the black hole?
2652000	2654000	Is the energy
2654000	2656000	we need
2656000	2658000	in the black hole
2658000	2660000	a reasonable amount
2660000	2662000	of energy
2662000	2664000	to produce
2664000	2666000	four different types
2666000	2668000	of energy
2668000	2670000	in the black hole?
2670000	2672000	The first is momentum,
2672000	2674000	which can provide
2674000	2676000	a lot of kinetic energy
2676000	2678000	to the gas around the black hole
2678000	2680000	and then kick it
2680000	2682000	to a far away place.
2682000	2684000	The other form is
2684000	2686000	thermal energy,
2686000	2688000	which can heat
2688000	2690000	the gas around the black hole
2690000	2692000	in various ways
2692000	2694000	such as radiational heating.
2694000	2696000	It can heat the gas
2696000	2698000	around the black hole
2698000	2700000	to a higher temperature.
2700000	2702000	The other form is
2702000	2704000	turbulent stirring,
2704000	2706000	which can stir the gas
2706000	2708000	around the black hole
2708000	2710000	to produce currents
2710000	2712000	in the black hole.
2712000	2714000	It can also
2714000	2716000	make the gas
2716000	2718000	around the black hole
2718000	2720000	more turbulent
2720000	2722000	and more difficult to collapse.
2722000	2724000	This is another possible form.
2724000	2726000	The other form is
2726000	2728000	cosmic ray,
2728000	2730000	which can
2730000	2732000	shock the gas
2732000	2734000	around the black hole
2734000	2736000	to produce
2736000	2738000	cosmic rays.
2738000	2740000	This is another
2740000	2742000	possible form
2742000	2744000	of energy.
2744000	2746000	If it is momentum,
2746000	2748000	it can heat
2748000	2750000	the gas around the black hole
2750000	2752000	to a higher temperature.
2752000	2754000	There are three possible forms
2754000	2756000	of thermal heating.
2756000	2758000	The first one is
2758000	2760000	uniformly heating
2760000	2762000	all the gas
2762000	2764000	in the galaxy.
2764000	2766000	The other one is
2766000	2768000	only heating
2768000	2770000	the gas
2770000	2772000	around the black hole
2772000	2774000	to a higher temperature.
2774000	2776000	The third one
2776000	2778000	is
2778000	2780000	heating
2780000	2782000	all the gas
2782000	2784000	in the galaxy
2784000	2786000	to a higher temperature.
2786000	2788000	The fourth one
2788000	2790000	is
2790000	2792000	heating
2792000	2794000	all the gas
2794000	2796000	around the black hole
2796000	2798000	to a higher temperature.
2798000	2800000	The fifth one
2800000	2802000	is
2802000	2804000	heating
2804000	2806000	all the gas
2806000	2808000	around the black hole
2808000	2810000	to a higher temperature.
2810000	2812000	The sixth one
2812000	2814000	is
2814000	2816000	heating
2816000	2818000	all the gas
2818000	2820000	around the black hole
2820000	2822000	to a higher temperature.
2822000	2824000	The seventh one
2824000	2826000	is
2826000	2828000	heating
2828000	2830000	all the gas
2830000	2832000	around the black hole
2832000	2834000	to a higher temperature.
2834000	2836000	The eighth one
2836000	2838000	is
2838000	2840000	heating
2840000	2842000	all the gas
2842000	2844000	around the black hole
2844000	2846000	to a higher temperature.
2846000	2848000	The ninth one
2848000	2850000	is
2850000	2852000	heating
2852000	2854000	all the
2854000	2856000	gas
2856000	2858000	around the black hole
2858000	2860000	to a higher temperature.
2860000	2862000	This is because
2862000	2864000	the diffusion coefficient
2864000	2866000	determines
2866000	2868000	how much
2868000	2870000	cosmic ray
2870000	2872000	stays in the middle
2872000	2874000	of the galaxy.
2874000	2876000	So how much cosmic ray
2876000	2878000	stays in the middle
2878000	2880000	determines how much chance
2880000	2882000	the cosmic ray will
2882000	2884000	collide with other gas
2884000	2886000	and produce gamma ray.
2886000	2888000	Since the total flux of
2888000	2890000	the gamma ray in the galaxy
2890000	2892000	has a limit,
2892000	2894000	the diffusion coefficient
2894000	2896000	determines how much
2896000	2898000	the cosmic ray will
2898000	2900000	stay in the middle
2900000	2902000	of the galaxy.
2902000	2904000	Based on the speed of the
2904000	2906000	earthquake,
2906000	2908000	you can calculate
2908000	2910000	the radius of
2910000	2912000	the cosmic ray
2912000	2914000	which will
2914000	2916000	be around
2916000	2918000	20-30 kpc.
2918000	2920000	It will start to thermalize.
2920000	2922000	The cosmic ray energy
2922000	2924000	will gradually heat up.
2924000	2926000	First, let's look at
2926000	2928000	the momentum injection.
2928000	2930000	This is the flux
2930000	2932000	of 36 quadrillion
2932000	2934000	CGS.
2934000	2936000	This is the result of
2936000	2938000	sharp motion ray.
2938000	2940000	When the momentum is not very strong,
2940000	2942000	it does not affect
2942000	2944000	the galaxy at all.
2944000	2946000	However, when the momentum
2946000	2948000	flux reaches 36 quadrillion
2948000	2950000	CGS,
2950000	2952000	it turns off
2952000	2954000	all sharp motion rays.
2954000	2956000	You can see that
2956000	2958000	the green line is not
2958000	2960000	on the plot at all.
2960000	2962000	However,
2962000	2964000	the gas in the middle
2964000	2966000	of the galaxy is blown away.
2966000	2968000	You can see that
2968000	2970000	there is no gas
2970000	2972000	in the middle of the galaxy.
2972000	2974000	You can see that
2974000	2976000	there is no gas in the middle of the galaxy.
2976000	2978000	You can stop the cooling flow
2978000	2980000	and stop the sharp motion ray.
2980000	2982000	You can stop the sharp motion ray.
2982000	2984000	You can also blow away
2984000	2986000	all the surrounding gas.
2986000	2988000	It is not consistent with observation.
2988000	2990000	Next, thermal heating.
2990000	2992000	We have
2992000	2994000	uniform heat up gas.
2994000	2996000	By gas heating,
2996000	2998000	it is confined to
2998000	3000000	30 kpc or only heating
3000000	3002000	the particles around the black hole.
3002000	3004000	The energy flux of the four of us
3004000	3006000	is about 10 to the power of
3006000	3008000	43 to the power of
3008000	3010000	45.
3010000	3012000	The first one you see
3012000	3014000	is the produced
3014000	3016000	sharp motion ray
3016000	3018000	based on the energy flux and the different kernel size.
3018000	3020000	The first one you see is the produced sharp motion ray based on the energy flux and the different kernel size.
3020000	3022000	If you heat up these gases uniformly,
3022000	3024000	you basically have no effect.
3024000	3026000	Even if you have a very high energy,
3026000	3028000	it doesn't affect the sharp motion ray.
3028000	3030000	But if you put the same energy
3030000	3032000	in the middle,
3032000	3034000	heat up to 30 kpc
3034000	3036000	or
3036000	3038000	put all the energy
3038000	3040000	in the middle of the black hole,
3040000	3042000	you can have a very big effect on the sharp motion ray.
3042000	3044000	You can see that
3044000	3046000	the more energy you put in the middle,
3046000	3048000	the stronger the
3048000	3050000	sharp motion ray suppression
3050000	3052000	you can produce
3052000	3054000	with the same energy.
3054000	3056000	For example, in the black hole neighborhood,
3056000	3058000	you can suppress the sharp motion ray
3058000	3060000	with very little energy.
3060000	3062000	In fact, there are some results
3062000	3064000	that are inconsistent
3064000	3066000	with observation.
3066000	3068000	In the first column,
3068000	3070000	we draw the density profile.
3070000	3072000	In the second column, we draw the temperature profile.
3072000	3074000	In the third column, we draw the turbulent velocity
3074000	3076000	as a function of radius.
3076000	3078000	At the end, you see that uniformly
3078000	3080000	heat up the gas,
3080000	3082000	all the lines are still the same as the black curve.
3082000	3084000	In fact, there is no change
3084000	3086000	in the energy input.
3090000	3092000	But if you put all the energy
3092000	3094000	in the gas next to the black hole,
3094000	3096000	the effect is very explosive.
3096000	3098000	For example, in the second column,
3098000	3100000	you can see that
3100000	3102000	the temperature in the middle
3102000	3104000	can be added to a very high level.
3104000	3106000	In addition,
3106000	3108000	the gas is also added
3108000	3110000	to a very high level.
3110000	3112000	In other words,
3112000	3114000	the gas temperature is too high
3114000	3116000	and the speed is too fast.
3116000	3118000	In fact,
3118000	3120000	if you take
3120000	3122000	a medium-value kernel
3122000	3124000	and distribute the thermal heating energy
3124000	3126000	to about 30 kpc,
3126000	3128000	you can make it
3128000	3130000	a little more stable.
3130000	3132000	Your energy will not be so high
3132000	3134000	or your speed will not be so fast.
3134000	3136000	But you will still produce
3136000	3138000	a negative temperature gradient.
3138000	3140000	The middle is hotter and the outside is colder.
3140000	3142000	Basically, this is not the same as observation.
3142000	3144000	Basically, the observation is
3144000	3146000	that the middle is colder and the outside is hotter.
3146000	3148000	The temperature gradient
3148000	3150000	is not the same as observation.
3152000	3154000	If you really look at
3154000	3156000	your energy,
3156000	3158000	we draw this picture
3158000	3160000	that you integrate
3160000	3162000	your cooling rate
3162000	3164000	from the middle to a certain radius
3164000	3166000	and your heating rate
3166000	3168000	from the middle to a certain radius.
3168000	3170000	The heating rate is the red line
3170000	3172000	and the cooling rate is the blue line.
3172000	3174000	The first thing you can compare
3174000	3176000	is that if you uniformly heat up the gas
3176000	3178000	from the top two lines,
3178000	3180000	basically
3180000	3182000	most of your heating
3182000	3184000	is at the
3184000	3186000	outermost gas.
3186000	3188000	But if you put all
3188000	3190000	the heating in the middle of the galaxy,
3190000	3192000	the heating rate in the middle
3192000	3194000	will be much larger than the cooling rate.
3194000	3196000	Basically, this is why
3196000	3198000	you will have a very explosive result.
3198000	3200000	If you use
3200000	3202000	a kernel like 30kpc,
3202000	3204000	you can distribute
3204000	3206000	these heating to about 30kpc.
3206000	3208000	Indeed, in some situations,
3208000	3210000	you can make your heating rate
3210000	3212000	slightly
3212000	3214000	similar to your cooling rate
3214000	3216000	in a larger radius,
3216000	3218000	but the result is very fine-tuned.
3218000	3220000	And even if you are very fine-tuned,
3220000	3222000	you will still have problems
3222000	3224000	with your cooling rate.
3224000	3226000	So basically,
3226000	3228000	if you just want to use thermal heating
3228000	3230000	to compensate the cooling flow,
3230000	3232000	you don't need to be very fine-tuned.
3232000	3234000	You just need to make sure
3234000	3236000	that your heating rate
3236000	3238000	is exactly the same as the cooling rate
3238000	3240000	in each location of the galaxy.
3240000	3242000	Otherwise, you will easily heat up
3242000	3244000	some parts of the galaxy
3244000	3246000	or produce a very explosive result.
3246000	3248000	So it's very fine-tuned.
3248000	3250000	Although it may work,
3250000	3252000	it may not work.
3252000	3254000	Next, let's talk about
3254000	3256000	Cosmic Ray Injection.
3256000	3258000	Cosmic Ray has
3258000	3260000	streaming instability
3260000	3262000	and heats up the gas.
3262000	3264000	It also collides with the surrounding gas
3264000	3266000	and produces hydronic and coulomb heating.
3266000	3268000	Diffusion is set to 12.9 quadrillion
3268000	3270000	units of CGS.
3270000	3272000	Energy input is
3272000	3274000	between 12.4 quadrillion
3274000	3276000	and 12.4 quadrillion.
3276000	3278000	These are
3278000	3280000	very efficient
3280000	3282000	to suppress shock measurement.
3282000	3284000	You can see that
3284000	3286000	if you add energy
3286000	3288000	in the form of Cosmic Ray
3288000	3290000	to the surrounding gas,
3290000	3292000	you can still
3292000	3294000	efficiently suppress
3294000	3296000	shock measurement.
3296000	3298000	If you look at
3298000	3300000	the density profile
3300000	3302000	and temperature profile,
3302000	3304000	the reason why
3304000	3306000	shock measurement is suppressed
3306000	3308000	is because the temperature
3308000	3310000	is a little higher than
3310000	3312000	the surrounding gas.
3312000	3314000	If you add the same amount
3314000	3316000	of energy
3316000	3318000	to the surrounding gas,
3318000	3320000	one side is
3320000	3322000	in the form of
3322000	3324000	Cosmic Ray,
3324000	3326000	and the other side
3326000	3328000	is in the form of
3328000	3330000	hydronic,
3330000	3332000	you can see that
3332000	3334000	in the form of Cosmic Ray,
3334000	3336000	it reduces
3336000	3338000	the density
3338000	3340000	in the middle of the galaxy.
3340000	3342000	Basically,
3342000	3344000	in the form of Cosmic Ray,
3344000	3346000	it suppresses
3346000	3348000	shock measurement
3348000	3350000	more efficiently than
3350000	3352000	in the form of hydronic.
3352000	3354000	This range is still
3354000	3356000	acceptable.
3356000	3358000	I want to clarify
3358000	3360000	something.
3360000	3362000	What do you mean by hydronic?
3362000	3364000	Hydronic means that
3364000	3366000	the particle in that place
3366000	3368000	is now bigger than
3368000	3370000	V2,
3370000	3372000	but it is basically
3372000	3374000	a thermalized movement.
3374000	3376000	Do you have anything
3376000	3378000	that can transfer energy
3378000	3380000	from one to another,
3380000	3382000	such as thermal radiation?
3382000	3384000	No.
3384000	3386000	We just say that
3386000	3388000	the heat energy
3388000	3390000	of the particle
3390000	3392000	does not generate
3392000	3394000	an average momentum
3394000	3396000	in a specific direction.
3396000	3398000	No.
3398000	3400000	Another extreme
3400000	3402000	is Cosmic Ray,
3402000	3404000	because all your energy
3404000	3406000	has a very clear
3406000	3408000	momentum direction.
3408000	3410000	No.
3410000	3412000	Our model is
3412000	3414000	Lagrangian-based code,
3414000	3416000	so each particle
3416000	3418000	may be thousands of solar mass
3418000	3420000	or 10,000 solar mass.
3420000	3422000	We model
3422000	3424000	Cosmic Ray in the fluid limit,
3424000	3426000	so it has a field
3426000	3428000	that is heat energy,
3428000	3430000	and it has a field that is Cosmic Ray.
3430000	3432000	We directly add its energy
3432000	3434000	to Cosmic Ray's field.
3434000	3436000	Cosmic Ray
3436000	3438000	is the same as
3438000	3440000	general heat energy.
3440000	3442000	It has a couple of hydrodynamic equations.
3442000	3444000	Cosmic Ray
3444000	3446000	will do PDV work on gas.
3446000	3448000	It also has energy loss.
3448000	3450000	Cosmic Ray energy loss
3450000	3452000	in the channel,
3452000	3454000	such as collision heating
3454000	3456000	or streaming instability.
3456000	3458000	It will reduce
3458000	3460000	Cosmic Ray's energy
3460000	3462000	and turn it into heat energy.
3462000	3464000	Oh, I see.
3464000	3466000	Thank you.
3468000	3470000	Why can Cosmic Ray
3470000	3472000	do this?
3472000	3474000	On the one hand,
3474000	3476000	there is a possibility
3476000	3478000	that Cosmic Ray
3478000	3480000	directly heats the gas.
3480000	3482000	Cosmic Ray
3482000	3484000	may be streaming heating
3484000	3486000	or collision
3486000	3488000	and heat the gas.
3490000	3492000	However,
3492000	3494000	the panel below
3494000	3496000	is accumulative heating.
3496000	3498000	We directly integrate
3498000	3500000	various channels
3500000	3502000	of Cosmic Ray's possible heating gas
3502000	3504000	from streaming
3504000	3506000	to collision
3506000	3508000	or loss.
3516000	3518000	The black line
3518000	3520000	is the input of
3520000	3522000	all Cosmic Ray's energy.
3522000	3524000	As you can see,
3524000	3526000	there are not many Cosmic Ray
3526000	3528000	that turn into heat energy.
3528000	3530000	Especially in
3530000	3532000	the case of
3532000	3534000	Star Formation,
3534000	3536000	which has been suppressed
3536000	3538000	and Quench.
3538000	3540000	You can see that
3540000	3542000	less than 10% of Cosmic Ray
3542000	3544000	turns into heat energy.
3544000	3546000	If you try to compare
3546000	3548000	the heat generated
3548000	3550000	by Cosmic Ray
3550000	3552000	from the middle to a certain radius
3552000	3554000	and the cooling rate
3554000	3556000	from the middle to a certain radius,
3556000	3558000	you can see that
3558000	3560000	the energy input
3560000	3562000	from Cosmic Ray
3562000	3564000	is less than the cooling rate.
3564000	3566000	This tells us that
3566000	3568000	Cosmic Ray's heating
3568000	3570000	is not the main reason
3570000	3572000	for suppressing
3572000	3574000	Star Formation or Cooling Flow.
3574000	3576000	The heat provided
3576000	3578000	is not enough.
3578000	3580000	Cosmic Ray also provides
3580000	3582000	pressure support.
3582000	3584000	It provides another form
3584000	3586000	of pressure
3586000	3588000	that pushes the gas
3588000	3590000	to the middle.
3590000	3592000	We found that
3592000	3594000	this is important.
3594000	3596000	If you try to calculate
3596000	3598000	two forces,
3598000	3600000	the first force is
3600000	3602000	the gravitational force.
3602000	3604000	The other force is
3604000	3606000	the pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray.
3606000	3608000	If there is a pressure gradient,
3608000	3610000	you will produce something like a buoyancy
3610000	3612000	that pushes the gas outward.
3612000	3614000	If you try to see
3614000	3616000	the difference between
3616000	3618000	the buoyancy of Cosmic Ray
3618000	3620000	and the gravitational force,
3620000	3622000	you can see that
3622000	3624000	under such a coefficient,
3624000	3626000	the energy input
3626000	3628000	is about four to three times
3628000	3630000	greater than the
3630000	3632000	pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray.
3632000	3634000	You can see that
3634000	3636000	the red line below
3636000	3638000	is the gravitational force
3638000	3640000	per unit mass,
3640000	3642000	and the black line
3642000	3644000	is the energy input.
3644000	3646000	You can see that
3646000	3648000	under such a coefficient,
3648000	3650000	the energy input
3650000	3652000	is about four to three times
3652000	3654000	greater than the
3654000	3656000	gravitational force
3656000	3658000	per unit mass.
3658000	3660000	In this case,
3660000	3662000	you can prevent the gas
3662000	3664000	from moving to the middle
3664000	3666000	of the galaxy.
3666000	3668000	The pressure gradient
3668000	3670000	of Cosmic Ray
3670000	3672000	can suppress star formation
3672000	3674000	because of the
3674000	3676000	pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray,
3676000	3678000	not because Cosmic Ray
3678000	3680000	heats up the gas
3680000	3682000	around it.
3682000	3684000	Finally,
3684000	3686000	let's talk about
3686000	3688000	turbulence.
3688000	3690000	Let's not ask where the
3690000	3692000	source of turbulence comes from.
3692000	3694000	Of course, it may be HMDB,
3694000	3696000	or it may be for other reasons.
3696000	3698000	Anyway, let's stir the gas externally
3698000	3700000	in a 100 kV mode.
3702000	3704000	We have uniformly stirred
3704000	3706000	the gas run.
3706000	3708000	There is no space difference
3708000	3710000	between the first two runs.
3710000	3712000	We have a core-turbulent
3712000	3714000	core run,
3714000	3716000	which is the gas in the center of the galaxy.
3716000	3718000	We try to make
3718000	3720000	the energy input greater
3720000	3722000	than 100 kV
3722000	3724000	in the form of turbulence.
3724000	3726000	From 1 to 4,
3726000	3728000	the gas in the center of the galaxy
3728000	3730000	is getting stronger and stronger.
3730000	3732000	The energy is getting higher and higher.
3732000	3734000	From 1 to 4,
3734000	3736000	the gas in the center of the galaxy
3736000	3738000	is getting stronger and stronger.
3740000	3742000	This is the result of
3742000	3744000	star formation history.
3744000	3746000	The upper panel is uniformly stirred
3746000	3748000	the gas case.
3748000	3750000	The lower panel is the case
3750000	3752000	in the center of the galaxy.
3752000	3754000	As you can see,
3754000	3756000	the gas in the center of the galaxy
3756000	3758000	is getting stronger and stronger.
3758000	3760000	This is the result of
3760000	3762000	star formation history.
3762000	3764000	In fact,
3764000	3766000	there are some things
3766000	3768000	that are different from observation.
3768000	3770000	For example,
3770000	3772000	if you uniformly stir the gas,
3772000	3774000	there is no space difference
3774000	3776000	between the first two runs.
3776000	3778000	It is very easy for you
3778000	3780000	to put too much energy
3780000	3782000	into the outer part of the galaxy.
3782000	3784000	The actual luminosity
3784000	3786000	is much lower.
3786000	3788000	This is not the same as observation.
3788000	3790000	On the other hand,
3790000	3792000	if you stir the gas
3792000	3794000	too hard,
3794000	3796000	you will also
3796000	3798000	increase the speed
3798000	3800000	of the gas.
3802000	3804000	Mach number is
3804000	3806000	the speed over
3806000	3808000	the sound speed.
3808000	3810000	Sound speed is
3810000	3812000	the speed
3812000	3814000	corresponding to the temperature.
3814000	3816000	If you stir too hard,
3816000	3818000	the Mach number
3818000	3820000	will be out of unity.
3820000	3822000	Of course, this is not the same as observation.
3822000	3824000	However, in addition to these extreme situations,
3824000	3826000	there is still some space
3826000	3828000	to suppress
3828000	3830000	star formation history.
3830000	3832000	On the one hand,
3832000	3834000	you still maintain the state
3834000	3836000	that is basically the same as observation,
3836000	3838000	and you can also
3838000	3840000	suppress star formation rate
3840000	3842000	and cooling flow.
3842000	3844000	So why does turbulent stirring
3844000	3846000	work?
3846000	3848000	There are several possible reasons.
3848000	3850000	The first one we might think of
3850000	3852000	is that you stir the gas
3852000	3854000	and it produces some currents.
3854000	3856000	Those currents
3856000	3858000	may eventually dissipate into heat.
3858000	3860000	These things
3860000	3862000	may eventually turn into heat
3862000	3864000	and the temperature of the gas
3864000	3866000	will increase.
3866000	3868000	On the other hand,
3868000	3870000	when we stir the gas externally,
3870000	3872000	the input energy
3872000	3874000	is much less than
3874000	3876000	the energy dissipation energy
3876000	3878000	of the gas,
3878000	3880000	at least less than 1%.
3880000	3882000	So the energy produced
3882000	3884000	by the channels
3884000	3886000	that turn the currents into heat
3886000	3888000	is far less than
3888000	3890000	the cooling flow.
3890000	3892000	We found that the more important reason
3892000	3894000	is mixing.
3894000	3896000	When you mix gas,
3896000	3898000	on the one hand,
3898000	3900000	you mix the cooled gas
3900000	3902000	into the CGM,
3902000	3904000	into the gas
3904000	3906000	with lower density.
3906000	3908000	If you check
3908000	3910000	the gas,
3910000	3912000	the gas with high density
3912000	3914000	at first,
3914000	3916000	and check
3916000	3918000	how much of it
3918000	3920000	is dense
3920000	3922000	and the temperature is low,
3922000	3924000	and how much of it
3924000	3926000	is hot,
3926000	3928000	you can see that
3928000	3930000	half of the gas
3930000	3932000	is stirred externally.
3932000	3934000	You stir
3934000	3936000	the gas
3936000	3938000	to a higher radius
3938000	3940000	or to the gas
3940000	3942000	with lower density.
3942000	3944000	So mixing
3944000	3946000	is mixing
3946000	3948000	the cooler gas
3948000	3950000	with the denser gas
3950000	3952000	with lower density.
3952000	3954000	We found that this is the more important reason
3954000	3956000	why it can suppress the cooling flow
3956000	3958000	and suppress star formation rate.
3958000	3960000	On the other hand,
3960000	3962000	because you stirred these gases
3962000	3964000	and you provided
3964000	3966000	the extra turbulent pressure,
3966000	3968000	the gas density
3968000	3970000	in the middle of the galaxy
3970000	3972000	is also reduced.
3972000	3974000	So you reduce the gas density
3974000	3976000	and also reduce the cooling rate.
3976000	3978000	Because the cooling rate
3978000	3980000	is equal to the square of the gas density,
3980000	3982000	the gas density is reduced
3982000	3984000	and the cooling rate is also reduced.
3984000	3986000	The cooling rate is also reduced
3986000	3988000	and the cooling time is also longer.
3988000	3990000	So this is another very important reason
3990000	3992000	because the density
3992000	3994000	in the middle of the galaxy is reduced.
3996000	3998000	So we just talked about
3998000	4000000	turbulent and cosmic ray
4000000	4002000	can be more stabilized,
4002000	4004000	stably suppressed.
4004000	4006000	Cooling flow and star formation rate
4006000	4008000	are also in the case of 12 and 14 square.
4008000	4010000	We also try to
4010000	4012000	simulate thermal heating
4012000	4014000	if you confine it in a
4014000	4016000	more open space.
4016000	4018000	It seems that the thermal energy can also work.
4018000	4020000	We try to put these three runs
4020000	4022000	in a smaller galaxy,
4022000	4024000	12 square, 12 square, 13 square,
4024000	4026000	see if it can work.
4026000	4028000	These three runs are the ones we just said
4028000	4030000	are the slightly more successful runs in 12 and 14 square.
4030000	4032000	Let's try to see if these three models
4032000	4034000	can work in a smaller galaxy.
4036000	4038000	Let's see if these three models can work.
4038000	4040000	For the thermal heating part,
4040000	4042000	we scale
4042000	4044000	its total energy input
4044000	4046000	according to the
4046000	4048000	cooling rate of all its
4048000	4050000	gases.
4050000	4052000	We scale our energy input
4052000	4054000	to a smaller galaxy.
4054000	4056000	We also make the kernel size
4056000	4058000	correspond to the size of the galaxy
4058000	4060000	and make the corresponding reduction.
4060000	4062000	For the Cosmic Ray Injection run,
4062000	4064000	we directly put
4064000	4066000	the thermal energy input
4066000	4068000	corresponding to the
4068000	4070000	cooling rate of the
4070000	4072000	corresponding galaxy.
4072000	4074000	For the Turbulent Stirring run,
4074000	4076000	we first put
4076000	4078000	the scale of the stirring mode
4078000	4080000	and the kernel size
4080000	4082000	corresponding to the size of the galaxy
4082000	4084000	and make the corresponding scale.
4084000	4086000	We also put the force of your foot
4086000	4088000	corresponding to the circular velocity
4088000	4090000	above your foot's scale
4090000	4092000	and make the corresponding scale.
4092000	4094000	Because the size of the galaxy is different,
4094000	4096000	the energy input and the scale input
4096000	4098000	are different.
4098000	4100000	This is how we scale.
4100000	4102000	As you can see,
4102000	4104000	this is the star formation history
4104000	4106000	of the 10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.
4106000	4108000	As you can see,
4108000	4110000	the Cosmic Ray Injection
4110000	4112000	can crunch the galaxy
4112000	4114000	in all cases
4114000	4116000	and the star formation rate
4116000	4118000	is very low.
4118000	4120000	As for the thermal heating,
4120000	4122000	it only works for the
4122000	4124000	10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.
4124000	4126000	It doesn't affect
4126000	4128000	the 10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.
4128000	4130000	The star formation rate
4130000	4132000	is still very high.
4132000	4134000	As for the Turbulent Stirring,
4134000	4136000	it can only suppress
4136000	4138000	the star formation rate
4138000	4140000	in the 10th, 12th,
4140000	4142000	13th, and 14th galaxies.
4142000	4144000	It doesn't affect
4144000	4146000	the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.
4146000	4148000	It just makes the star formation rate
4148000	4150000	jump up and down.
4150000	4152000	Why is that?
4152000	4154000	Why doesn't the
4154000	4156000	10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies
4156000	4158000	have the same effect
4158000	4160000	as the Turbulent Stirring and
4160000	4162000	Thermal Heating?
4162000	4164000	First, let's look at Thermal Heating.
4164000	4166000	In the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies,
4166000	4168000	many gases
4168000	4170000	don't have high temperatures.
4170000	4172000	The temperature
4172000	4174000	of the 10th, 12th,
4174000	4176000	and 14th galaxies
4176000	4178000	is around
4178000	4180000	12°C to 12°C.
4180000	4182000	These gases
4182000	4184000	are the main
4184000	4186000	cooling rate of
4186000	4188000	gases.
4188000	4190000	Thermal Heating
4190000	4192000	also provides
4192000	4194000	energy input,
4194000	4196000	but it also
4196000	4198000	heats up
4198000	4200000	more heavy elements
4200000	4202000	and denser gases
4202000	4204000	to this temperature.
4204000	4206000	The gases
4206000	4208000	in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies
4208000	4210000	cool down very quickly.
4210000	4212000	Many gases
4212000	4214000	are placed in the same position,
4214000	4216000	which increases
4216000	4218000	the cooling rate.
4220000	4222000	The picture on the right
4222000	4224000	shows the cooling rate
4224000	4226000	of the radio-integrated gases.
4226000	4228000	The cooling rate
4228000	4230000	is from the center of the galaxy
4230000	4232000	to the outer part of the galaxy.
4232000	4234000	The black line shows
4234000	4236000	no energy input.
4236000	4238000	The red line shows
4238000	4240000	thermal heating.
4240000	4242000	The thermal heating
4242000	4244000	provides energy,
4244000	4246000	but it also increases
4246000	4248000	the cooling rate
4248000	4250000	in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.
4250000	4252000	The cooling rate
4252000	4254000	increases
4254000	4256000	the cooling rate
4256000	4258000	in the 10th, 12th,
4258000	4260000	and 14th galaxies.
4260000	4262000	The cooling rate
4262000	4264000	is not that much higher
4264000	4266000	in the 10th, 12th,
4266000	4268000	and 14th galaxies.
4268000	4270000	The cooling rate
4270000	4272000	in the 10th, 12th,
4272000	4274000	and 14th galaxies
4274000	4276000	is not so much higher
4276000	4278000	in the 10th, 12th,
4278000	4280000	and 14th galaxies.
4280000	4282000	The movie on the left
4282000	4283820	shows the
4284000	4286000	cooling rate
4286000	4288000	in the 10th, 12th,
4288000	4290000	and 14th galaxies.
4290000	4292000	The upper left corner
4292000	4294000	shows the temperature
4294000	4296000	in the 10th, 12th,
4296000	4298000	and 14th galaxies.
4298000	4300000	At the end of the simulation,
4300000	4302000	you can see
4302000	4304000	a lot of gas
4304000	4306000	being heated
4306000	4308000	and rising
4308000	4310000	to a higher position.
4310000	4312000	However,
4312000	4314000	when it reaches a higher position,
4314000	4316000	it cools down
4316000	4318000	and starts to
4318000	4320000	rise again.
4320000	4322000	This is a demonstration
4322000	4324000	of the cooling rate
4324000	4326000	in the 10th, 12th,
4326000	4328000	and 14th galaxies.
4328000	4330000	The cooling rate
4330000	4332000	in the 10th, 12th,
4332000	4334000	and 14th galaxies
4334000	4336000	is not that much higher
4336000	4338000	in the 10th, 12th,
4338000	4340000	and 14th galaxies.
4340000	4342000	The cooling rate
4342000	4344000	in the 10th, 12th,
4344000	4346000	and 14th galaxies
4346000	4348000	is not that much higher
4348000	4350000	in the 10th, 12th,
4350000	4352000	and 14th galaxies.
4352000	4354000	and the cooling rate
4354000	4356000	in the 10th, 12th,
4356000	4358000	and 14th galaxies
4358000	4360000	is not so high
4360000	4362000	in the 10th, 12th,
4362000	4364000	and 14th galaxies.
4364000	4366000	the cooling rate
4366000	4368000	in the 10th, 12th,
4368000	4370000	and 14th galaxies
4370000	4372000	is not so high
4372000	4374000	in the 10th, 12th,
4374000	4376000	and 14th galaxies.
4376000	4378000	the cooling rate
4378000	4380000	in the 10th, 12th,
4380000	4382000	and 14th galaxies
4382000	4384000	is not so high
4384000	4386000	in the 10th, 12th,
4386000	4388000	and 14th galaxies.
4388000	4390000	and the cooling rate
4390000	4392000	in the 10th, 12th.
4392000	4394000	galaxies
4394000	4396000	has a 때도
4396000	4398000	which means
4398000	4400000	just applying
4400000	4402000	as long as your kernel size
4402000	4404000	is not so low
4404000	4406000	around 50 kbz
4406000	4408000	turbulent stream can still work
4408000	4410000	in the 12th and 14th galaxies
4410000	4412000	star formation rate can still work
4412000	4414000	in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.
4414000	4416000	this is my conclusion
4416000	4418000	the first part we said
4418000	4420000	the nitrogen feedback type solution
4420000	4422000	does not work
4422000	4424000	it only has a very small impact
4424000	4426000	the reason for the stator feedback
4426000	4428000	is that it only changes
4428000	4430000	the temperature
4430000	4432000	the main reason is that
4432000	4434000	the total energy input
4434000	4436000	is much smaller than the cooling rate
4436000	4438000	the magnetic field cosmic ground supernova
4438000	4440000	is also the same
4440000	4442000	the energy is not enough
4442000	4444000	the conduction
4444000	4446000	the big reason
4446000	4448000	is that it is suppressed
4448000	4450000	by the magnetic field line
4450000	4452000	because the direction of the temperature
4452000	4454000	and the direction of the stator
4454000	4456000	is different
4456000	4458000	let me show you
4466000	4468000	so
4468000	4470000	the thermal conduction
4470000	4472000	will be projected to the direction of the stator
4472000	4474000	so it is suppressed
4474000	4476000	we also said
4476000	4478000	the morphology of star formation
4478000	4480000	basically
4480000	4482000	the impact of star formation
4482000	4484000	does not affect the cooling rate
4484000	4486000	we also talked about
4486000	4488000	the AGM feedback
4488000	4490000	we tried four different toy models
4490000	4492000	one is
4492000	4494000	momentum
4494000	4496000	one is thermal conduction
4496000	4498000	one is stator
4498000	4500000	one is cosmic ray
4500000	4502000	only add momentum
4502000	4504000	in the direction of R
4504000	4506000	basically
4506000	4508000	if the energy is not enough
4508000	4510000	you did not do anything
4510000	4512000	if the energy is enough
4512000	4514000	you did not do anything
4514000	4516000	it is not the same as the observation
4516000	4518000	if you
4518000	4520000	increase the temperature of the gas
4520000	4522000	it may work
4522000	4524000	it may reduce the star formation rate
4524000	4526000	and the cooling flow
4526000	4528000	but you have to fine tune
4528000	4530000	you have to
4530000	4532000	let the heat
4532000	4534000	locally fit
4534000	4536000	the cooling speed of the gas
4536000	4538000	otherwise
4538000	4540000	it will overheat
4540000	4542000	thermal heating
4542000	4544000	is not efficient
4544000	4546000	if you add more energy
4546000	4548000	the cooling speed
4548000	4550000	will be faster
4550000	4552000	so it is not efficient
4552000	4554000	next is turbulent stirring
4554000	4556000	if you stir the gas
4556000	4558000	you can suppress the star formation rate
4558000	4560000	effectively
4560000	4562000	because you can
4562000	4564000	mix the gas
4564000	4566000	on the other hand
4566000	4568000	you can reduce the density
4568000	4570000	these are the two reasons
4570000	4572000	if you
4572000	4574000	control the stirring
4574000	4576000	within 100 kpc
4576000	4578000	you will not throw a lot of gas
4578000	4580000	into the galaxy
4580000	4582000	and suppress the
4582000	4584000	extra luminosity
4584000	4586000	next is cosmic ray
4586000	4588000	this can also work
4588000	4590000	because of the pressure support
4590000	4592000	suppress the density
4592000	4594000	basically
4594000	4596000	I did not talk about rejuvenation
4596000	4598000	basically
4598000	4600000	the result is
4600000	4602000	turbulent stirring and cosmic ray
4602000	4604000	are very important
4604000	4606000	to solve the cooling flow problem
4606000	4608000	and control the galaxy
4608000	4610000	thank you
