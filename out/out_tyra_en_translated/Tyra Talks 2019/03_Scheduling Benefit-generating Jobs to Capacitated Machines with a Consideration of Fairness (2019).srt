00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to today's Taira Talk.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today is February 16, 2019.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our speaker is Professor Kong Lingjie.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Professor Kong Lingjie is a Vice-Professor of Information Management at National Taiwan University.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He was a Ph.D. student at Berkley University in the U.S.,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and a master's and master's student at National Taiwan University.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
His research focuses on competition theory and professional research,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and discusses decision-making in the business sector.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We are delighted to welcome Professor Kong Lingjie.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's welcome Professor Kong Lingjie.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Professor Kong Lingjie.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank you all.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can I start now?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, you can.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you all for coming to this talk.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is a rare opportunity for me.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When I was a Ph.D. student or when I started teaching,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I would like to listen to all kinds of strange talks.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The so-called strange talk is different from my own field.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
From a certain perspective, it is very necessary for people like us.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Because we study information management.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me briefly introduce information management.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We study information technology at the Department of Management.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We want to use information technology to see if we can do something in the field of management.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Basically, it is a cross-field field.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So we often listen to all kinds of other talks,

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and we can get a lot of inspiration.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sometimes it doesn't inspire at all, but it doesn't matter.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Just treat it as a broad text.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So when I was a Ph.D. student,

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Jason often introduced me to some physics-related knowledge.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Although I almost forgot everything,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I still feel very happy about this exchange.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Today, I will use this opportunity to introduce my research field to you.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is of course one of the studies, but I personally quite like it.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It was done by a student of my previous master's class named Liu Qiwei.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is actually his master's thesis.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Of course, we did it together in the process.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As a result, I think this study is still quite good in terms of academic results.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So a Ph.D. student from NTU or a Ph.D. student who is serious can really achieve quite good results.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, what is this study about?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The theme of this study is called Job Allocation with a Consideration of Fairness.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It is a work allocation problem that considers fairness.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's take a look at what this is about.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Today, when we want to do job allocation, we usually have to consider a lot of issues.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
For example, let's assume that the job is a toy car.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In general, I am a worker.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I make a toy car.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If I make a toy car that takes two hours,

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I sell it to the buyer, the consumer.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The buyer will pay me.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So the job is to spend time to make something, sell it, and change the money.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's that simple.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Today, the reason why we started to discuss this topic was probably the year I came back to Taiwan.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
At that time, I met a company in Zhukou.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There are five or six supply factories.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There are many factories in Nankou and China.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sorry, it's not a supply factory.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's a company that makes LED chips.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The problem with this company is that its customers will place orders with it.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
For example, this order says I want 100 toy cars.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Or how many LED chips do I want?

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The company's owner is responsible for allocating work to each factory.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
When allocating work, there will be a so-called fairness issue.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Every factory wants to fight for the so-called better order.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Some orders have a work load.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That is, you have to spend a lot of time.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Benefit is that the cost-effectiveness or the degree of easy-to-earn money is very low.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
For example, some relatively traditional things are produced.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This kind of profit is small and time-consuming to do.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Everyone doesn't like this.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Or, for example, the yield rate is very low when doing it.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's difficult and everyone doesn't like it.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So these factory managers are all going to be reviewed in the end.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then they will really happen.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They will go to the head of the company and scold him.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why is this order divided to others and not to me?

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So from that time on, I realized that when this work allocation happened between people.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He did encounter some interesting issues.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It is not encountered in traditional work allocation.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Traditional work allocation is usually at the beginning.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Whether it's an employee or a public person.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They are talking about this work allocation.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's more often that I assign the work to the machine or the CPU.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then they naturally don't have any fair or unfair questions.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Does everyone listen to you?

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When you assign work to people, people will definitely care about fairness.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In addition to caring about their own workload and their own revenge.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I care about how I compare with others.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's probably like this.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's why everybody wants to earn more money.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So in the food problem just now.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Motivate us to do this study.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
After that, we slowly simplified it into the following topics.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In other words, we will have a lot of work.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Every work will have the time it takes.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And how much money can be made after this work.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For example, it takes two hours to make this small car.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then you can make so much money.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It takes 2.5 hours to make this medium car.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can make more money.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The big car is the most advanced.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It takes 4.5 hours to make the most money.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So there are all kinds of work.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Some are more difficult to do.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Some make more money.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then we have a lot of so-called factories.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Their capacity is limited.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You can't give all the work to the same factory.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So in this problem.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We want to do work allocation.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Then you might think.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is there any other situation?

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I also want to do this kind of work allocation.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In fact, there are quite a few.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Here are a few examples.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
These examples were later seen one after another.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The first example is Kaohsiung Port.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Kaohsiung Port is a project we are discussing now.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Kaohsiung Port is probably like this.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We are talking about the so-called flood.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you don't know much about flood.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If you are interested, you can google it.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is to find out what the flood is doing.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Probably like this.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Suppose there is a boat here today.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This boat wants to come to Kaohsiung Port.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then stop like this.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The route I am drawing now is Port 2.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This place is Port 1.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Port 1 is closer to the north.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So this is near Shanduoshang Circle.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This place is probably like this.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This one here.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is a miracle that everyone may have been to.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In short.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
When this boat wants to come in now.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He can't come in directly.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He must be in this place.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Waiting for the flood people to go up.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Flood people are those who live near the pier.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The senior captain.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They used to have many years of boat.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The experience of running around everywhere.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then later.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
After turning into a flood person.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They will live near the port.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When there is a boat coming in.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Flood people will be in the open sea.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Will take a small boat to the open sea.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Temporarily take over this boat.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
With the captain of that boat.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Drive the boat in.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The reason for the need for flood people.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course it is because of a port.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Local people know better.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So these people in Kaohsiung Port.

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or flood people.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They know more about the situation in Kaohsiung Port.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then inside Kaohsiung Port.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The setting of this port.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And so on.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So he can bring the boat in like this.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's the same to take it out.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Then the boat moves between the pier.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's the same.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All need flood people.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
In terms of the size of Kaohsiung Port.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Kaohsiung Port has about 40,000 boats a year.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Then there are 40 flood people.

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Then they are obviously.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
All the work in this year.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's going to be divided to these 40 flood people.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There are more than 100 boats on average every day.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then there are more than 100 boats.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Come in and out.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Scattered within 24 hours.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Then these flood people.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm going to finish them one by one.

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's it.

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why is there a so-called fairness problem here?

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A boat comes in.

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
A flood person to bring.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Some boats are difficult to bring.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
For example, a boat carrying oil.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Boat carrying dangerous goods.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Or a super big boat.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This kind of boat is difficult to bring.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Some boats are very simple.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then it's more troublesome to get to the port.

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's easy to get out of the port.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Everyone imagines parking on the side of the road.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Of course, parking on the side of the road is easy to drive out of the road.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's hard to park.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So it's obvious that your work is simple and difficult.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So there are different bonuses.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What about the flood people?

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He gets some bonuses every time he brings a boat.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's tens of thousands of dollars less.

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hundreds of thousands of dollars more.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This amount is amazing.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a lot worse.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So for the flood people.

204
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If they want to allocate their work.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What they care about most is not the degree of overtime.

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Or the relationship between me and the merchant.

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They all consider these.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But what they care about most.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or something that can't be ignored.

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is it fair to divide these jobs?

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can't do some races every time I go.

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then do something that is difficult to do.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The salary is relatively low.

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then give it to him every time it's done.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That won't work.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So this is an example of job allocation.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I divide the work.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Everyone has to be able to eat and play.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Can't risk driving.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
At the same time, we have to consider everyone's so-called money.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Can't be too different.

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Or can't be too different from his job.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
A similar example is a massage shop.

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There will be a lot on the side of the road.

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Whether he is a blind man or not.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Or this is a special massage for you to relax.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then you can relax after work.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This kind of massage shop.

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Massage shop is generally you go in.

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's quite a job.

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then there are a bunch of massage masters inside.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Usually there are a few people in turn.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So they have to be divided.

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Some shops will use the way of turning around.

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The way of turning around may be good or bad.

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But it's the same.

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He will definitely encounter a problem of fairness.

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can't do the same job every time.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Then give it to another person.

240
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Finally, there is the so-called social enterprise.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The meaning of the word social enterprise is probably to say.

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The purpose of the establishment of this company.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is to promote social welfare.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Instead of his own company to make the most money.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For Taiwan.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Just give an example.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There is a company called Dazhi Culture.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He basically sells the so-called Dazhi magazine.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is called Big Issue.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is not unique to Taiwan.

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
His feature is.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He put the newspaper magazine.

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is the Dazhi magazine.

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He handed it to the tourist.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let the tourist sell it.

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This mechanism itself is not the point.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The point is.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Since you are giving these jobs to the so-called tourist.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Of course, your goal is to hope that every tourist can make a certain amount of money.

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Instead of maximizing the company's total profits.

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So in many of these examples.

262
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We can all see.

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Basically there is a person.

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He is a central control unit.

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He is responsible for the distribution of work.

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The traditional distribution of work is.

267
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have some subordinates.

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I will divide the work.

269
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They will be obedient.

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then they will finish their work after they have finished listening.

271
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then we have profits.

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There is a revenge, etc.

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Then I maximize my personal total profits.

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It used to be like this.

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But in some topics.

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
For example, in this topic we consider.

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can also see that a lot of time.

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The distribution of work is not actually concerned about overall efficiency.

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In fact, it is fairness.

280
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If that's the case.

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Maybe you need a new way.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Or you need to adjust the old way.

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's probably like this.

284
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So, uh.

285
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In terms of this question.

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Job this thing can be said to be a love and hate.

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
On the one hand, it is that you have to spend time doing your job.

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But it is also a precious resource.

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Because doing the job is making money.

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So, we have to use a good way.

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Divide the job to our work units.

292
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Then we are on the word.

293
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I will still call these work units machine.

294
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Because in this schedule.

295
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Scheduling in this field.

296
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's what everyone calls it.

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Just call him a machine.

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But we know ourselves.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Our so-called machine is here.

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
More like an agent or an employee.

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like this.

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, we don't just consider.

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We don't just want to maximize the total profit.

304
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The main thing is to consider fairness.

305
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So, our machine will have the so-called limited capacity.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's just you.

307
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
One day's work is limited.

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So you can't do more than your load.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Work.

310
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So, we.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The setting in this place is.

312
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
As long as you have enough capacity.

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then you will want to do more work.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Just like a masseur or a waterman.

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So, you are on duty today.

316
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Then, as long as your workload can be replenished.

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You want to do a little more.

318
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Make more money.

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's probably what it means.

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Then, we assume that the work cannot be split.

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That depends on the situation.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But in the example we just talked about.

323
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Massage master usually.

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
His work will not be divided.

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You go in.

326
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Someone will give you a foot massage.

327
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Or someone will help you relax your shoulders.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He won't relax his shoulders until two-thirds.

329
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Suddenly change the next person.

330
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Right?

331
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's usually like this.

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's not to mention Kaohsiung Port.

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He helped you bring the boat in from the sea.

334
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Stop well.

335
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He won't change a waterman halfway.

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This is a waste of time.

337
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So, we assume here.

338
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Job can't be divided.

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In some cases, of course.

340
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For example, there is a customer who orders with me.

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He wants 100 toy cars.

342
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Of course, I can give it to factory A and factory B.

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Each makes 40 and 60.

344
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Right?

345
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But in terms of food.

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Sometimes the company doesn't want to split the order like this.

347
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Because it's obvious that it's going to cause some homework.

348
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Difficulties and troubles.

349
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
In addition to the academic.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We can easily prove.

351
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If the work of this problem can be freely distributed.

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And if there is no cost.

353
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then this problem will be very.

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The existing method can be easily solved.

355
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So whether from the perspective of food or from the perspective of theory.

356
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Support us to do this setting.

357
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In some cases, work can't be divided.

358
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Then we will also discuss this point.

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So the overall goal of our question is.

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I want to maximize this so-called minimum benefit.

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Among machines.

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This thing is a core setting of our topic.

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So let's talk about it.

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Why are we doing this?

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Uh, basically.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I have a question.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You can come.

368
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Uh, I can't split that assumption.

369
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It will lead to that.

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because you just said that if you can split it.

371
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It can be easily solved.

372
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So what you mean is.

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
For example, if you can split it to infinity.

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Basically, it's a concept of division.

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You divide it by how many agents in total.

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then that's it.

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Is it like this?

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
A little bit more complicated than that.

379
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Uh, that's what we're doing today.

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
First, from a technical point of view.

382
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Uh, we'll show you the mathematical model later.

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So you'll see that we're going to have a whole number of planning problems.

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So if the work can be divided today.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It will become a linear planning problem.

386
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That linear planning problem already has.

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Uh, everyone can accept it.

388
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
A good way to solve it.

389
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Uh, so this is.

390
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
A more academic answer.

391
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So what you just said is.

392
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So-called it's all gone.

393
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Similar similar.

394
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Uh, although it's not a very.

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's not always possible to get the best solution.

396
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But it's almost the same concept.

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So that's it.

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If today's job can be.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Any partition.

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then to infinity.

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then there's no cost.

402
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
If you want to divide it by a few points.

403
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Indeed, this problem does not need to be studied.

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Like this.

405
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is that okay?

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Did I turn it on?

407
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh, I turned it on.

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Hey, can you hear me now?

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There is.

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh, okay.

411
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So good.

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Then I have another small problem.

413
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I just got that.

414
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The other small problem is.

415
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If you have this assumption.

416
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It sounds like it's still you.

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You're still going to use it next.

418
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Right?

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Or will you say.

420
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's going to be like throwing some.

421
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
For example, like.

422
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Material simulation.

423
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And then run some.

424
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What kind of simulation?

425
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And then look at some.

426
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The results of the statistical distribution.

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Still.

428
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You will still tend to.

429
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is to calculate the result.

430
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

431
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
OK.

432
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah, because you just said.

433
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
OK, good.

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's it.

435
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Thank you.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Thank you.

437
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's right.

438
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's what we're going to do.

439
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This study is basically.

440
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
A study of homework.

441
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That is, as you will see later.

442
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The main task is.

443
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Write a mathematical model to describe this problem.

444
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And help him write a algorithm.

445
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, uh, you just mentioned Monte Carlo.

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ah, this value simulation and so on.

447
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Because of our problem.

448
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You'll see it later.

449
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We are a deterministic problem.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So, uh, you don't need to use these.

451
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Uh, statistical distribution, and so on.

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's basically a standard algorithm problem.

453
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh, but we'll talk about it later.

454
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Then we'll see you later.

455
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's above this line.

456
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Basically, it's about the setting of our topic.

457
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We have a bunch of jobs.

458
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We have a bunch of so-called machine or agent.

459
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And then, uh, we think about the so-called fairness that agent cares about.

460
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That fairness needs a measurement.

461
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That is, after we distribute the work, they make money.

462
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
After that, we need to measure the so-called fairness.

463
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There are many ways to measure fairness.

464
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
For example, there are people in academia who do this.

465
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That is, everyone makes money.

466
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The person who makes the most money.

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't make the most.

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't make too much.

469
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Or the person who makes the most and the person who makes the least.

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't be too different.

471
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Or the money everyone makes.

472
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Don't be too big.

473
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, and so on.

474
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So you can write a lot of goals.

475
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
For example, I minimized.

476
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Maximum benefit.

477
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It means that I have ten people.

478
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And then everyone makes money.

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That ten people make the most money.

480
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
See how much money he makes.

481
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm going to minimize the money he makes.

482
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Or I minimized.

483
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Maximum benefit.

484
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Minimum benefit.

485
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Like this.

486
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, there's one person who makes the most.

487
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's one person who makes the least.

488
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And then we're going to minimize this gap.

489
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Or I'm going to minimize.

490
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Variance of benefit.

491
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, that's fine.

492
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
These things are OK.

493
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But in our topic.

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If we choose these goals.

495
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Then we have to deal with benefit at the same time.

496
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We have to deal with fairness and efficiency at the same time.

498
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's going to be a lot of trouble.

499
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Why?

500
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because if we use these goals.

501
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Then the best solution will become very natural.

502
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't do all the work.

503
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't do it all.

504
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Everyone makes $0.

505
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This is also the best.

506
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is also the best.

507
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This is also the best.

508
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
All the goals are optimized by you.

509
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Can't be optimized anymore.

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But efficiency is 0.

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It will become that.

512
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We have to use other ways to limit.

513
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We can't give up our overall efficiency completely.

514
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So, in the end, we use this.

515
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The goal is this.

516
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This is my job for everyone.

517
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Everyone makes money.

518
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I see which unlucky guy makes the least.

519
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm going to maximize that unlucky guy.

520
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I make money.

521
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If that's the case.

522
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
First of all, the poorest person will not be too poor.

523
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The worst person will not be too bad.

524
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is quite in line with our fair intuition.

525
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The second is if you want to maximize as much as possible.

526
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The money of the person who makes the least money.

527
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Naturally, other people will not make much more than him.

528
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Because in this case, this goal will not be satisfied.

529
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's the end.

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If my goal is to maximize the minimum benefit.

531
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
In fact, we will show it to you at the end.

532
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The overall efficiency will not be too different.

533
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We can ask the same question.

534
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I maximize efficiency or maximize fairness.

535
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If we use this setting to maximize fairness.

536
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That efficiency will not go anywhere.

537
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's about it.

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So we will start with this goal.

539
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Then we are today.

540
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Uh, because, uh, most of us.

541
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This friend is not doing the so-called research in this field.

542
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So, of course, we choose the gold.

543
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
How do you say it?

544
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's easier to understand.

545
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So I'll do a few more things later.

546
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm going to write down the formulation of this problem.

547
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You mean to use simple mathematical formulas.

548
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's define exactly what I just said.

549
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
After that, there is a model.

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It will allow us to prove that it is NP-hard.

551
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That NP-hard is a CS.

552
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Or, uh, it's the word used by people in the field of computer science or research.

553
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's probably what I mean.

554
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I want to prove that this problem is very difficult.

555
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, is it that we can't look forward to it?

556
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You can get the best result within a reasonable time frame.

557
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So we're going to design a so-called heuristic.

558
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That is to say, oh, this problem is so difficult that we can't find the best solution.

559
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So let's find a feasible solution.

560
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And then we'll take a look at this feasible solution.

561
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's analyze its performance.

562
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's probably like this.

563
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That analysis of performance is, uh, how do you say it?

564
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's also very difficult.

565
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So we're just going to pick one of the little parts of our whole study.

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's the easiest part to understand, but it's also the most essential part to share with you.

567
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That is to say, the same problem.

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You can also design a heuristic.

569
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I can also design a heuristic.

570
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
He can also design a heuristic.

571
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's easy to design a heuristic.

572
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But what we want to do is to find the theoretical nature of our heuristic.

573
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
See how good it can be or how bad it can be.

574
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hopefully, this will give us a better understanding of the heuristic.

575
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's about it.

576
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Okay.

577
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So let's formulate this problem.

578
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Uh, our field is called homework research.

579
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Operations research.

580
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
At the beginning, it was.

581
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Linear programming that everyone learned when they were young.

582
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
If you have no impression of linear programming, you probably did something like this when you were a kid.

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You have x and y.

584
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And then they're limited.

585
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That is, for example, x plus 2y.

586
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Uh, sorry, this is 2x plus y.

587
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And then x plus 2y, and then x plus 2y, and then x plus 4, and so on.

588
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So you're going to have a feasible region, x is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and so on.

589
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And then you're supposed to have a goal, like I want to maximize x plus y.

590
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, well, then you're going to have a line, and then you're going to push it this way, and then you're going to get the best solution.

591
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This thing is linear programming.

592
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Generally speaking, the homework research method is that I try to write the problem into linear programming, non-linear programming, and so on.

593
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And then we use all kinds of methods to solve it.

594
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So now we're going to do something similar.

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm going to define my decision problem.

596
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The goal is limited and there are character variables.

597
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So let's go back to the topic we just talked about.

598
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I have a group of people, agents or machines.

599
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's my work unit.

600
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And then I have a group of jobs that I'm going to divide.

601
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And then, today, I have a few jobs.

602
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I have a few machines.

603
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So m is machine, and the other symbol n is job, like this.

604
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And then I have a limit on every machine.

605
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I work eight hours a day, this kind of thing.

606
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So I have a limit on my work time.

607
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This is called K, called Capacity.

608
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Every job has the work time it needs.

609
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So it's called CJ.

610
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
This is usually called Processing Time in Scheduling Literature.

611
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
How long does this job take to finish?

612
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And then JobJ.

613
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
JobJ has its benefit, which is how much money I can get after I'm done.

614
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So our task is to determine the so-called XIJ.

615
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
XIJ is a so-called 0-1 variable.

616
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It's for every job and every machine.

617
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I ask myself if I'm going to let machine I do JobJ.

618
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
If so, that means I'm going to assign J to I.

619
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Then I'm going to set its value to 1.

620
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Otherwise, I'm going to set it to 0.

621
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Something like this.

622
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Now that we have this role variable,

623
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Let's see how we're going to describe what we just talked about.

624
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The target room, the limit room, and so on.

625
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This problem is very simple to describe.

626
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Let's look at the bottom here.

627
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The first thing is that for every machine or every agent.

628
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The total workload I assign to it cannot exceed its work time.

629
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
How do you say that?

630
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
XIJ is equal to 1, which means I assign J to I.

631
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So I ask every job,

632
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Did I assign J to this I?

633
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
If so, then this work time has to be added up.

634
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So the total work time I get cannot exceed the amount I can recover.

635
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This is the limit room 1.

636
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The limit room 2 is that every job is assigned to at most one machine.

637
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So I look at all the machines that I may be assigned.

638
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
XIJ can only have one person at most.

639
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Here, XIJ, we set it to be either 0 or 1.

640
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It can't be 0.3 or 0.8 or something like that.

641
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This means that this work cannot be divided.

642
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The final goal is here.

643
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I want to maximize the so-called minimum benefit.

644
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
How do you say that?

645
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
For every I, for every machine,

646
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm going to calculate how much benefit I get.

647
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
If XIJ is 1, it means I got that job.

648
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I got that job, I did it, and then I got this benefit.

649
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So XIJ is the benefit I get.

650
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You earn $8, I earn $5, he earns $16.

651
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
The unluckiest of us is $5.

652
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The goal value is 5.

653
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I want to maximize the money earned by the least amount of money.

654
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It's probably like this.

655
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So this place.

656
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
There are a few values.

657
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's here.

658
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's review it.

659
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I basically maximize the minimum total benefit among machines.

660
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Then the first one is capacity constraint.

661
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That is, my work time is limited.

662
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The second one is job can be done only once.

663
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So it's a job that can only be done once.

664
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
It can only be distributed to one person.

665
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And then finally, the job can't be split.

666
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's probably like this.

667
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's jump out here and talk about a few things.

668
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We have a few settings here.

669
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
BJ, CJ and K.

670
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
This is equivalent to assuming that each machine is exactly the same.

671
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So their work time constraints are the same.

672
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And then every job is, uh, every job is assigned to you or assigned to me.

673
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The profit is the same.

674
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And then how long does each job take?

675
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's the same.

676
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
These settings are sometimes established and sometimes not.

677
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
For example, K.

678
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What about K?

679
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If I'm talking about a massage master today, it's not necessarily.

680
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Some people might be able to do it for eight hours a day.

681
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Some people can only do it for four hours a day, right?

682
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
BJ is doing a job today.

683
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
How much can you charge the customer?

684
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
This may be the same.

685
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Massage master.

686
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But this one person comes in.

687
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Then you press, you are 400 yuan, I press, you are 400 yuan.

688
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
OK.

689
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That CJ is not necessarily the same.

690
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Not necessarily the same or not the same.

691
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
For example, a massage master is usually a job.

692
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
30 minutes, 20 minutes, and so on.

693
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So that CJ will naturally be the same.

694
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But if today is, for example, a drinker, a drinker.

695
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Some people have better skills, some people are faster, some people are slower.

696
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
This is possible.

697
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But in the end, in fact, we have done it before.

698
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
K, you can make it different for everyone.

699
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
This is OK.

700
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
CJ, you can become C.I.J.

701
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
BJ, you can become B.I.J.

702
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
As long as you meet some reasonable settings, this problem can still be dealt with.

703
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But today, because of the time limit, we don't talk so much.

704
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We just assume that BJ is the same for everyone.

705
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
CJ is the same for everyone.

706
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The so-called everyone is the same.

707
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's divided for you or for me.

708
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We make the same money.

709
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's what it means.

710
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And then finally, K, everyone is the same.

711
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Let's assume this thing.

712
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Then, uh, I just mentioned that if this job can be divided.

713
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Then this place will become X.I.J.

714
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Between 0 to 1.

715
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
At this time, this problem is that you can move a little bit more.

716
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It will become a linear program.

717
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It becomes a linear program.

718
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That linear program will be the general commercial server.

719
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It can be solved.

720
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, there's nothing to study about this problem.

721
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Okay, so today, uh, I'm going to skip it.

722
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So today, after that question, in our field, first of all, we have to prove that this question is NP-hard.

723
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The meaning of NP-hard, of course, I'm not going to talk about the details here.

724
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But what it means is that if you can prove that a problem is NP-hard.

725
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It means that people in the academic world basically recognize that this problem is not the best solution within a reasonable time range.

726
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You mean that the complexity of this problem is very high.

727
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That's probably what it means.

728
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay, so the question just now, if you're not in this field, it's probably hard to imagine why it's so complicated.

729
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay, why is it so difficult to get the best solution?

730
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So let's just describe this proof a little bit.

731
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So here's the problem.

732
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm going to assume that my question just now is a little bit simpler.

733
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
A special case.

734
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There are actually only two machines in this special case.

735
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And these two machines are uncapacitated, which means that their workload is infinitely large.

736
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Or far larger than all the workload.

737
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So in this case, our problem will become the so-called partition problem.

738
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What does it mean?

739
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
My workload is already limitless.

740
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So the workload limit no longer exists.

741
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I only care about how many benefits these jobs will get.

742
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Work 1 can earn $3, work 2 can earn $4, and so on.

743
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And then my fairness issue is that I'm going to divide this pile of benefits as evenly as possible to two people, right?

744
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's best to stack it up like this.

745
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
This problem is called partition problem in mathematics or computer science.

746
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I give you a bunch of integers and you divide it into two piles.

747
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Try to make these two piles the same size.

748
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
In fact, this problem is NP-hard.

749
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
As long as you have enough numbers, you can't find a good answer to this problem.

750
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You divide it, you divide it, but you can't tell.

751
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And then you can't even tell if they can be divided into two piles of the same size.

752
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It can't be done in a reasonable amount of time.

753
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So even partition can't do it.

754
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Our problem is more difficult than partition.

755
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's just that we can't do it any more.

756
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That's about it.

757
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Well, in that case, let's find a heuristic algorithm.

758
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This thing is what I'm doing now.

759
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Hey, I have a question.

760
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Can you go back to the last page?

761
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But the problem you have to deal with is that you just have to maximize the minimum benefit.

762
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You don't have to be partition.

763
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
In this case, it's still NP-hard.

764
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Can you fully correspond to this partition problem?

765
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Hey, that's a good question.

766
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We're maximizing the minimum benefit.

767
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So we're doing this thing in general.

768
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But when we only have two machines.

769
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
We're going to want to make them as big as possible, right?

770
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah, if we can't make it the same size.

771
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Then this thing is not fair in some sense.

772
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Or the way we can maximize the minimum benefit is to make them the same size.

773
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That's a good answer.

774
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But you might have that thing.

775
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Okay, I know.

776
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

777
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Let me correct this partition problem.

778
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It has two versions.

779
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Version one is that I give you a bunch of numbers.

780
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Ask you if you can divide them into a pile of the same size.

781
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Version two is that I give you a pile of numbers.

782
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You help me minimize the difference between these two numbers.

783
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Like this.

784
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
OK.

785
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And then these two questions are all in the same place.

786
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

787
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
In fact, version one is relatively simple.

788
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Version one is the decision problem.

789
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's a yes or no.

790
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Version two is the optimization problem.

791
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You have to find a set of distribution methods.

792
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So our question is version two of the expansion version.

793
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Like this.

794
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
OK, good.

795
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Thank you.

796
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
OK, and then it's here.

797
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So today we're basically not going to look for the best solution.

798
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So we're going to look for the so-called feasible solution.

799
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Use heuristic algorithm.

800
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Heuristic is an inspiration algorithm in Chinese.

801
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's actually an experience law.

802
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
There's a lot of numbers here.

803
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
How do you divide it better?

804
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Well, I don't know.

805
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But why don't you just divide it like this?

806
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's usually pretty good.

807
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's probably what it feels like.

808
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Heuristic algorithm sounds like a waste from an academic point of view.

809
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's just that if it's a very, very simple rule-based algorithm,

810
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
People think it sounds like it's very simple.

811
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Is that really okay?

812
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But in fact, it's almost always done that.

813
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Uh, for the example of Kaohsiung Port.

814
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
When we were discussing with them, we said, oh, that sounds like a job allocation problem.

815
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So let's design the algorithm.

816
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And after a while, they found out that they were very worried that the algorithm would be blacked out.

817
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That is to say, someone wrote a software to do the job allocation.

818
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
What if the person who wrote the software colluded with a few of them?

819
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And then it's a lot of favoritism.

820
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What do you do with those inspirations?

821
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah, there's no way to solve it.

822
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So that's to say, if this algorithm is implemented into the job allocation between the drinkers,

823
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The algorithm must be very simple and easy to explain.

824
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Everybody can understand.

825
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So today, when a job is assigned to A instead of B,

826
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The file with the history record and the algorithm must be able to explain why it is assigned to A instead of B.

827
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
There is such a requirement.

828
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So in this case, it becomes that you can't use a complicated algorithm.

829
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You have to use a relatively simple but effective algorithm.

830
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So you can't use that kind of neural network.

831
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You just have to use a relatively simple algorithm.

832
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then it can get a certain effect.

833
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay, so let's find a simple algorithm.

834
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But what if you want to design an algorithm for that question?

835
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Look at the file.

836
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So look at the file.

837
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
In 1966, someone studied a very similar problem.

838
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You have a bunch of machines.

839
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
They all look the same.

840
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But you have to minimize and make span.

841
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
What does that mean?

842
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That is, you have a bunch of jobs.

843
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
These jobs all have the so-called CJ, which is workload.

844
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So every job has to spend a certain amount of time.

845
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
At that time, there was no benefit in that problem.

846
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You just divide a bunch of work into a bunch of machines.

847
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And then hope to minimize the total time of the machine that takes the longest.

848
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So this problem is on the academic side.

849
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's kind of like this kind of problem.

850
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And then there was a man.

851
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
He did a similar problem in 1982.

852
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He's the same.

853
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
There's only workload at work.

854
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But he's the one who maximizes the satisfaction of that person.

855
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
That is to say, after the job is done, there is a person who does the least.

856
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm going to maximize his work.

857
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So.

858
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
These two questions are very similar, right?

859
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's a bunch of work.

860
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It takes time.

861
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Graham, he's the one who minimizes the longest.

862
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Dual Mayor is the one who maximizes the shortest time.

863
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But in short, it's all about fairness as far as possible.

864
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So the way they use it is very simple.

865
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That is to say, uh, what we use today is called LPT.

866
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This algorithm is that I arrange the work from large to small.

867
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
According to the formula.

868
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And then after the sequence, we start to divide the big work.

869
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Every time you want to divide it, you divide it to the most comfortable and relaxed person at the moment.

870
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's probably like this.

871
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And then it's over.

872
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This algorithm is very intuitive.

873
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
If you divide it to the most comfortable person every time.

874
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Then his current total work is the smallest.

875
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Of course, you'll be the most balanced.

876
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And then the work has to be arranged from large to small.

877
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That makes sense, too.

878
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Because small work can finally insert air.

879
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So let's take a look at the example.

880
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Suppose I have four jobs and two machines.

881
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The four jobs are 7542.

882
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And then I have two empty machines.

883
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That 7542 has been arranged, right?

884
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So the workload is 7.

885
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm going to give it to the machine.

886
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
At this time, I'm going to give it to the machine.

887
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Because the machine is more comfortable now.

888
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
He just didn't work.

889
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And then the next thing is work 3.

890
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Work 3 is going to be given to the machine.

891
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Because the current workload of the machine is relatively small.

892
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And then the last job 2.

893
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Of course, the job 2 is given to the machine.

894
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So that's how simple the algorithm is.

895
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So based on their longest processing time.

896
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Then we'll fix it a little bit.

897
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We'll change it to Capacitated Highest Benefit Job First.

898
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It's called CHBF.

899
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
This method is to say.

900
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We have the so-called benefit today.

901
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And then there's no, uh, sorry.

902
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And then our goal is to balance the benefit.

903
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So when we arrange the jobs from large to small.

904
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's in the order of benefit.

905
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
OK.

906
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
After we're done, every time we're going to divide the job.

907
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Just divide it to the current accumulated benefit.

908
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The smallest job.

909
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We'll give it to him.

910
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So when you divide it, you have to see if it has capacity.

911
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
If the capacity is not enough.

912
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Then we'll give it to the second順位.

913
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And then we'll give it to the third順位.

914
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And so on.

915
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Well, you've been doing this thing over and over again.

916
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Until we finish the job.

917
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The so-called division is also possible.

918
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's not finished.

919
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Because every machine has a capacity limit.

920
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So there are some jobs that can't be done in the end.

921
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It's also very possible.

922
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Well, if a job can't be given to any machine.

923
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Then we'll throw it away.

924
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.

925
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's probably like this.

926
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So.

927
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Uh, in academia, we can easily analyze the complexity of this problem.

928
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But even if you don't write that formula to analyze.

929
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's okay.

930
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It looks very simple.

931
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Job sequence.

932
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And then we divide the divide divide divide divide divide divide.

933
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So this method is very easy to implement.

934
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Well, suppose we have this today.

935
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The same.

936
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We have two jobs and, uh, sorry, four jobs and two machines.

937
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So let's try it.

938
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The capacity of these two machines is eight.

939
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Uh, at most, you can only do eight hours of work.

940
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And then, four jobs, nine dollars each.

941
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Nine dollars, five hours, six dollars, six hours, three dollars, three hours, two dollars, two hours.

942
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Two.

943
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So we're going to start with this nine-dollar job.

944
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Take it first.

945
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Okay, so he'll give it to the machine first.

946
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And then the six-dollar one is given to the machine.

947
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And then there's the three-dollar one, right?

948
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The three-dollar one is supposed to be given to the machine.

949
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because the machine only makes six dollars at the moment.

950
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
But I can't divide it when I want to.

951
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Because he can't eat it.

952
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Then he had to give it to the machine.

953
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And then the last one was given to the machine.

954
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So this algorithm is probably running like this.

955
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Okay, so that's what today's questions are.

956
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It's just a random question for you.

957
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's easy for you to design algorithms.

958
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
But it's very difficult for you to show him good.

959
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So what's good?

960
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
There are usually two kinds of measured indicators.

961
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm going to finish these two pages.

962
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
That's about it.

963
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That is to say, I randomly give you 10 million jobs.

964
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And then you just, uh, I randomly produce these jobs.

965
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You just give me a row.

966
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And after that, we can calculate the target market value.

967
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
How much is it, right?

968
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
At the same time, we can also find some benchmark algorithms.

969
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Let's compare it with everyone.

970
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So we have 100 people.

971
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
100 people each propose 100 algorithms.

972
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So we just throw it down every time.

973
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And then it depends on whose algorithm usually performs better.

974
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Okay, so that's the first plan.

975
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The second plan is that we use a more theoretical proof.

976
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The method is to find the worst case performance of the algorithm.

977
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
What he means is probably that for your proposed algorithm.

978
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Can you prove that no matter what strange instance is thrown to you.

979
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Your performance can be good to a certain extent.

980
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That is to say, I know that my algorithm will not find the best solution.

981
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But no matter how bad it is, it can't be bad to a certain extent.

982
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's probably what it means.

983
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
What about us?

984
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
This so-called worst case performance guarantee.

985
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
If you can find it.

986
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It can give us some psychological confidence when we use algorithms.

987
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
In other words, I also know that the algorithm I found is not the best solution.

988
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But it's not too far from the best solution.

989
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's probably what it means.

990
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Okay, so.

991
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We used to have Graham, this dual mayor.

992
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
They all found the so-called performance guarantee.

993
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
In Graham's case, I'm going to do my job today.

994
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I'm going to minimize make spend.

995
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Minimize the total cost of the person who does the longest.

996
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
At that time, he can prove that his algorithm's performance guarantee is 4.4.

997
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
133% means that if the best solution is 100.

998
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
He will find at least 133 or less.

999
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Because it's a minimization problem.

1000
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So the smaller your target market value, the better.

1001
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
He can guarantee that his solution is at most one-third of the best solution.

1002
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
That dual mayor.

1003
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Sorry.

1004
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The dual mayor is that his problem is the other way around.

1005
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So it becomes three quarters.

1006
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
In other words, if the best solution is 100.

1007
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Your mayor's solution is at least 75 or more.

1008
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
That's probably what it looks like.

1009
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And then there were some other people who did some refinement.

1010
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So our goal is the same.

1011
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We want to help our algorithm find a performance guarantee like this.

1012
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
As a result, of course there is.

1013
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We have this performance guarantee in all kinds of situations.

1014
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So let's just talk about one.

1015
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That is to say, if today our job benefit.

1016
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
With workload is a linear relationship.

1017
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
That is to say, a car is 5 yuan, two cars are 10 yuan, three cars are 15 yuan.

1018
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
If you do a few hours, you will get various benefits at the bottom of the line.

1019
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Oh, if it's this situation.

1020
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Then our algorithm.

1021
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
We can guarantee one-third.

1022
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That is to say, if the best solution is 100.

1023
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Then we can do at least 50 or more.

1024
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That's probably what it looks like.

1025
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Then there is a vote here.

1026
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Then I'll skip this one.

1027
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Then we want to emphasize one thing.

1028
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That is.

1029
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
The best solution is 100.

1030
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Then you guarantee more than 50.

1031
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It sounds pretty good, right?

1032
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh, at this time.

1033
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
We have to explain one thing.

1034
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That is, 50 is actually the most ideal situation.

1035
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That is to say, one-third of the guarantee is the limit of our algorithm.

1036
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, what do you mean?

1037
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Suppose I have a lot of machines today.

1038
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Then these machines, they are basically.

1039
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Uh, he.

1040
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Suppose I have several machines.

1041
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
M machine.

1042
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Then I have two M plus one job.

1043
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Among them.

1044
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
A lot of work.

1045
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
2M work is just half the capacity.

1046
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Only a little bit bigger.

1047
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Then if today is.

1048
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
To do this allocation.

1049
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Then I use my algorithm.

1050
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I'll put the biggest one in first.

1051
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Then this one will just fit.

1052
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Can't fit any other work.

1053
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The other machines will just fit two.

1054
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Two.

1055
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Oh, so my solution.

1056
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It's probably half of the best solution.

1057
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's what it means.

1058
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We just found 1 in 2.

1059
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
This solution, this performance guarantee.

1060
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
There's no way to improve it any more.

1061
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, this is the limit.

1062
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But there's still no way to answer.

1063
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Some of the other people's questions.

1064
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's just that you might think.

1065
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
One-half is still very small.

1066
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The maximum solution is 100.

1067
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You can only find 50.

1068
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Does that really work?

1069
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
At this time, we can do some later.

1070
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Value experiment.

1071
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
To prove that he is actually.

1072
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
In average, it's usually not too bad.

1073
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh, so like this kind of research.

1074
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm going to do a numerical study later.

1075
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
That is, then we will randomly produce a pile of instances.

1076
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Throw it to this algorithm.

1077
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And then, after the algorithm spit out the solution.

1078
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
We're going to throw this pile of instances into a server.

1079
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Let the server run for three days and three nights.

1080
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Find the best solution.

1081
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And then let's take a look at my algorithm.

1082
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
0.2 seconds out.

1083
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
With the server running for three days and three nights.

1084
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The best solution that came out.

1085
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
How much difference is there?

1086
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
That's basically through all kinds of research.

1087
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's probably all about this relationship.

1088
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh, here.

1089
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That is to say.

1090
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Our algorithm.

1091
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The fairness index found.

1092
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
With the fairness index found by the best solution.

1093
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's usually two percent.

1094
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Four percent, eight percent, and so on.

1095
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And then?

1096
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Uh, in some particularly.

1097
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
In a tight situation.

1098
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Our algorithm.

1099
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The worst of the worst is probably to find 90 percent.

1100
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Around the solution.

1101
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That is to say, the best solution is 100.

1102
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
He found 90.

1103
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It's probably like this.

1104
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And then in a relatively easy-to-handle situation.

1105
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
He can find 98 percent, 97 percent, and so on.

1106
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh, that's because the time is up.

1107
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So I'm not going to go into the details.

1108
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But generally speaking, what we do in this type of research.

1109
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's just like that.

1110
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You have a problem.

1111
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The old man didn't solve it.

1112
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Then you solve it.

1113
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
After you design a algorithm.

1114
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
From a theoretical point of view.

1115
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Make sure he's not too bad.

1116
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And then use a numerical experiment to say that he's actually pretty good.

1117
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's probably like this.

1118
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Okay, so to sum up.

1119
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Oh, sorry.

1120
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Hey.

1121
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Oh, the speaker said his computer was out of power.

1122
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Let's wait for him now.

1123
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Let's take this time to think about any questions you have.

1124
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Hey, I just had one that I didn't quite understand.

1125
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Let me discuss it with you.

1126
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
If I'm not mistaken.

1127
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
He's generating those random instances.

1128
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Basically, it's completely independent and unrelated.

1129
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And then look at a distribution, right?

1130
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But in fact, for example, let's use a drinker.

1131
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I can do this this year.

1132
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
For example, I generate a solution based on this guideline.

1133
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And then I'll do this this year.

1134
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And then see what happens.

1135
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And then adjust the next year's sequence according to this situation.

1136
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And then adjust the next year's sequence.

1137
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So, in fact, every instance should be.

1138
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's going to be more refined.

1139
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Not irrelevant.

1140
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Right?

1141
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Oh, you mean those instances.

1142
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Uh, maybe this year's instance and next year's instance.

1143
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
There should be some relationship.

1144
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
For example, maybe the big ship always has 50% of the time.

1145
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The small ship always has 20% of the time.

1146
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, so you split it this year.

1147
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And then I feel like this.

1148
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Hey, let's take a look at the fairness of the last one.

1149
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The variance of each merchant ship.

1150
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And then use this as an indicator.

1151
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
To adjust the next year's sequence.

1152
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It's a bit like your Newton's law.

1153
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The initial guess.

1154
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And then refine it to a more.

1155
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
A process.

1156
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's not going to be a bunch of guesses.

1157
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It's irrelevant.

1158
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Oh, yeah.

1159
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I think this is quite interesting.

1160
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
You can ask him later.

1161
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Maybe his method.

1162
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
If it's random.

1163
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
His lower bound is not so good.

1164
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But he refined it to the maximum speed.

1165
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Much faster than others.

1166
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Isn't that amazing?

1167
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
What you mean is.

1168
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
If you have some understanding of his instance.

1169
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You know.

1170
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
What does the job look like?

1171
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
There should be a better solution.

1172
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah.

1173
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I think this seems to have two questions.

1174
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
That is.

1175
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
One question is.

1176
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
This year's solution.

1177
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And then.

1178
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And then look at the difference.

1179
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
How much to adjust.

1180
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Is this question going to be refined?

1181
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's a question in itself.

1182
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Oh, expert.

1183
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I never thought about it.

1184
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Is it going to be refined?

1185
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's a question in itself.

1186
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Because if this question is.

1187
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Is a continuous.

1188
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Continuous function optimization.

1189
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's usually refined, but.

1190
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Continuous plus smooth.

1191
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Some of the conditions will be refined.

1192
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But.

1193
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Because his optimization seems to be separated.

1194
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Then not continuous.

1195
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So it's hard to say if it will be refined.

1196
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Oh.

1197
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Hi.

1198
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Hi.

1199
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So is there a slide?

1200
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I can't hear him.

1201
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
No, he has no sound.

1202
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Hello Xiaojie.

1203
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Xiaojie is still there.

1204
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Can you hear me?

1205
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yes.

1206
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But we can't see you.

1207
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Screen.

1208
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And people.

1209
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Hello.

1210
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Hello.

1211
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Hey.

1212
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Sorry.

1213
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I'm back.

1214
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Give me 20 seconds.

1215
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Got it.

1216
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I'm so sorry.

1217
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I.

1218
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I just found out.

1219
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I forgot to put.

1220
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I just forgot to put the pen.

1221
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Bring the power line.

1222
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So I changed the computer in a hurry.

1223
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Okay, in short.

1224
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
We just finished talking like that.

1225
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Thank you all.

1226
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Clap your hands.

1227
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's a little funny.

1228
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'll just sum it up.

1229
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
In short, as I just said.

1230
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Basically, this Fairness research.

1231
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It sounds like it makes sense.

1232
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But in fact.

1233
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
There are not many people who have studied.

1234
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Most of the research.

1235
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Are maximizing.

1236
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Overall effect.

1237
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So for this so-called job.

1238
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You love him and hate him.

1239
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Or between this agent.

1240
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Discuss fairness issues with each other.

1241
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
In fact, there is little discussion.

1242
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
This question also has a certain discussion value.

1243
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
After all, he is NP-hard.

1244
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So the good algorithm.

1245
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Or the theoretical value of the algorithm.

1246
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It can also be discussed.

1247
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Then we all did these things.

1248
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
In fact, it's not very good.

1249
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But it's done anyway.

1250
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It's probably like this.

1251
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Okay, thank you all.

1252
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Let's thank the speaker again.

1253
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
OK.

1254
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
There were some questions just now.

1255
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yes.

1256
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Let me ask.

1257
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Let me ask first.

1258
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh.

1259
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
My question is like this.

1260
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You just said.

1261
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Although you can.

1262
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
There are some ways you can get.

1263
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Upper bound 1.33.

1264
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Then the lower bound.

1265
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
For example, there are some lower bound.

1266
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
If you generate a lot of.

1267
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Random instance.

1268
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You can look at a distribution.

1269
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Then say this is the lower bound.

1270
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
For example.

1271
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
This example.

1272
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
For example.

1273
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I use such a guideline today.

1274
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
To distribute.

1275
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Then everyone runs like this this year.

1276
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But I can see the results of this year.

1277
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
As an index.

1278
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
To adjust how to arrange next year.

1279
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and so.

1280
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I actually have a way.

1281
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
In this way.

1282
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Keep going to a better solution.

1283
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Not every year.

1284
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
What is the difference between each method?

1285
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
What I just said.

1286
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It sounds like.

1287
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
The difference between theoretical research.

1288
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Can I hear it like this?

1289
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Can you hear it?

1290
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Thank you.

1291
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
That is to say.

1292
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
We forgot what we just said.

1293
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
In short.

1294
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
This is a problem that needs to be solved.

1295
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
There are a bunch of ships coming.

1296
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Then we have to run.

1297
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Then we have to sign them.

1298
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
We want to make our goal as good as possible.

1299
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Of course you can.

1300
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Every year.

1301
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Your algorithm will make some adjustments.

1302
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
The algorithm must be able to let you adjust.

1303
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Then you have some parameters.

1304
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It will do some settings.

1305
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
This is OK.

1306
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So what you just said is definitely no problem.

1307
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You can make adjustments according to the change in the environment and the situation.

1308
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Then make adjustments.

1309
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
In theory.

1310
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Let's think about an algorithm.

1311
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Its performance guarantee is two things.

1312
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
That is.

1313
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I'll give you 1,000 ships today.

1314
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
100 ships.

1315
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You use any algorithm to line up.

1316
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
As long as it's not the best solution.

1317
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You don't know how far you are from the best solution.

1318
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Because you don't even know how much the best solution is.

1319
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Right?

1320
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So you line up.

1321
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Some people don't like it.

1322
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But in short, you don't know how far you are from the best solution.

1323
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
OK.

1324
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
The theoretical nature of the algorithm.

1325
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
What's that?

1326
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
He's telling us.

1327
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Our algorithm.

1328
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
How far can our algorithm be from the best solution?

1329
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
How far is it?

1330
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So this is two things.

1331
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
In fact, as long as we line up the solution.

1332
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Everyone can accept.

1333
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Everyone thinks it's OK.

1334
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That's just in theory.

1335
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Everyone can know further.

1336
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
How far are we from the best solution?

1337
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
That's about it.

1338
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
OK.

1339
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Thank you.

1340
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Thank you.

1341
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Are there any other questions?

1342
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Let me ask you a question.

1343
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I joined later.

1344
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I heard that there is a requirement.

1345
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That is to say.

1346
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This algorithm has to be easy to explain.

1347
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Is there any specific quantifier?

1348
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
What kind of algorithm is easy to explain?

1349
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Or what kind of algorithm is not easy to explain?

1350
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
The specific quantification.

1351
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
As far as I know, there should be no.

1352
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Because the explanation is for people to hear.

1353
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
The so-called people can not accept this kind of explanation.

1354
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I don't have anything.

1355
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
People can accept within 15 seconds.

1356
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's called good.

1357
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Then it's not good for more than 15 seconds.

1358
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
This kind of 15-second quantification.

1359
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That's probably the only thing I can say.

1360
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Our algorithm.

1361
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
First of all.

1362
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Why is it in some cases.

1363
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Good performance, bad performance.

1364
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
To make sense.

1365
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Then why did he give this job to you?

1366
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Instead of giving it to him.

1367
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
To be able to say.

1368
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
The weaknesses of the algorithm.

1369
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
That's it.

1370
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So it's still a straightforward.

1371
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Explanation method.

1372
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
There is no so-called indicator.

1373
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Explainable indicator.

1374
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Basically, there should be no.

1375
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I'll just say it again.

1376
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It sounds like this.

1377
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
There may be two.

1378
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Indicators in different directions.

1379
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
One is.

1380
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Uh.

1381
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
The algorithm has to explain.

1382
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Why is this job given to A?

1383
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Not to B.

1384
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
This thing itself.

1385
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
It seems to correspond to.

1386
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Uh.

1387
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
The algorithm itself is weak.

1388
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It can't be too complicated.

1389
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Maybe there are only two or three lines of weak.

1390
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It's called simple.

1391
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
This is the first one.

1392
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Then the second one.

1393
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Uh.

1394
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It seems to be more like.

1395
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Uh.

1396
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Uh.

1397
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Or.

1398
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm not sure if it's the worst case.

1399
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But.

1400
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Or how would a certain case be divided?

1401
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Then this case.

1402
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
To be simple enough.

1403
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Then.

1404
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Is it true that this algorithm is good or bad?

1405
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Is that what it means?

1406
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Hey, that's right.

1407
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yes, it is.

1408
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Explainable includes.

1409
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Uh, you just talked about these different aspects.

1410
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Uh, that's why the algorithm does this.

1411
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Why in this step.

1412
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Give this job to that person.

1413
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Uh, this is an explanation.

1414
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And then.

1415
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Why less work or more work.

1416
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Or when the work is tight, the work is loose, etc.

1417
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Why in this situation.

1418
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Well done.

1419
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yes, these two are the so-called explainable range.

1420
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
That.

1421
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Uh, as I understand it.

1422
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
If we are engineers.

1423
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The point of the engineer is to solve the problem.

1424
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So as long as the algorithm performs well.

1425
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Say again.

1426
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So the explanation may not be so important.

1427
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
That's like now.

1428
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Deep learning.

1429
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Those neural networks, etc.

1430
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
They're all accurate.

1431
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So far, people haven't been able to explain why they're so accurate.

1432
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Anyway, let's use it first.

1433
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
The academic will slowly follow up from the explanatory aspect.

1434
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And then, oh, he's really so accurate.

1435
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
There must be a reason.

1436
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That's why there's a way to copy it later.

1437
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
So everyone will look for.

1438
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Explanation.

1439
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
So the explanation of this kind of thing is also very important in academia.

1440
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So back to the question we just talked about.

1441
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Why is our question in.

1442
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Actually, it's also very important to explain.

1443
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's just a special case.

1444
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It's because.

1445
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
The object of our explanation is those.

1446
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
The people in the back row.

1447
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
They care about fairness.

1448
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
A lot of times the care is not to be black box.

1449
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So this algorithm is for them.

1450
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
They don't quite understand.

1451
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So I think it's a black box.

1452
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So you have to be able to explain when there's a dispute.

1453
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Why is it arranged like this?

1454
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
It's probably like this.

1455
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But it's also.

1456
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
These information methods.

1457
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Sometimes when you want to apply it in practice.

1458
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
The problem is.

1459
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Uh.

1460
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Uh.

1461
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Can I ask you another question?

1462
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Okay.

1463
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Uh.

1464
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I remember when I was talking about the black box.

1465
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Yes.

1466
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
There is an example.

1467
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Uh.

1468
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
If I am the person who designed this algorithm.

1469
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Then I might.

1470
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I am a black box myself.

1471
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Then I will collude with some people.

1472
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Then this black box to them.

1473
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Especially cool or particularly bad.

1474
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Uh.

1475
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
No one wants to be particularly bad and collude.

1476
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But.

1477
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But this is the design.

1478
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The black box.

1479
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Uh.

1480
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
This can be explained.

1481
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It seems to be another concept.

1482
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Because.

1483
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Is there a collusion?

1484
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Or is there a black box?

1485
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Uh.

1486
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I think mathematically.

1487
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It seems to be more than this human brain.

1488
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Can accept.

1489
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Can the human brain accept this in 15 seconds?

1490
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
This point can be more.

1491
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
This.

1492
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
To express in a mathematical way.

1493
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Or.

1494
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Or check if it meets such conditions.

1495
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I haven't thought of a specific way yet.

1496
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But I think.

1497
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Is there a collusion or is there a black box?

1498
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It seems to be easier.

1499
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Handled mathematically.

1500
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Uh.

1501
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
That's pretty good, right?

1502
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Yes.

1503
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Okay.

1504
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I also want to ask a question.

1505
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Okay.

1506
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Uh.

1507
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You have this algorithm now.

1508
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
What I want to ask is.

1509
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
When it comes to food.

1510
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
For example.

1511
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The question of the drinker.

1512
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You may be based on.

1513
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Data from the previous year.

1514
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You may know this ship.

1515
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
This is the proportion of the ship.

1516
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
How is it?

1517
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Your work.

1518
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
What is the proportion of the workload?

1519
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
How many big ships and how many small ships?

1520
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
That is food.

1521
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Will be based on.

1522
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Because this is what I mean.

1523
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Your instance is not random.

1524
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
That is food.

1525
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Will be based on such.

1526
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Is not random.

1527
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
To design algorithms.

1528
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Of course.

1529
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That is.

1530
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
For example, work to come.

1531
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
He must have.

1532
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
If Kaohsiung Harbor.

1533
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
He came in the middle of the night.

1534
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Kaohsiung Harbor must be added.

1535
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So most ships.

1536
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Will come in during the day.

1537
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Then especially at 7 o'clock in the morning.

1538
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Will come at 8 o'clock in the morning.

1539
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
More than a hundred a day.

1540
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Because most of the ships.

1541
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
He will be out at 5 or 6 o'clock.

1542
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So.

1543
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You will definitely consider your work.

1544
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
They are not random.

1545
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Consider those patterns.

1546
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You already know that at 7 o'clock in the morning.

1547
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
The workload is particularly large.

1548
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Logically speaking.

1549
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Of course, it is around 7 o'clock.

1550
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
There are a lot of people on duty there.

1551
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So it is necessary to do the corresponding.

1552
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Of course.

1553
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Can it be done on food?

1554
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Another thing.

1555
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
For example, the people of Kaohsiung Harbor.

1556
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
They are in turn.

1557
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
There are rules for their shifts.

1558
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
One person is 24 hours in turn.

1559
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Then.

1560
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
We also discussed with them.

1561
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
There are a lot of people at 7 o'clock in the morning.

1562
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
A little more people.

1563
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
For some reason.

1564
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But this doesn't seem to be the point.

1565
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The point is that what you said is definitely.

1566
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Will go to deal with.

1567
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
That food algorithm.

1568
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Naturally.

1569
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
From the one we just talked about.

1570
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
A simple algorithm to make some adjustments.

1571
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Probably like this.

1572
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
OK.

1573
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I think everyone should be very easy to understand.

1574
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That is.

1575
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
The algorithm of writing paper and the algorithm of food.

1576
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Obviously there will be differences.

1577
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
When the algorithm is to be discussed in academia.

1578
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Must be.

1579
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Relatively abstract situation.

1580
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Relatively.

1581
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Relatively.

1582
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Simple algorithm to deal with.

1583
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Simple does not mean simple.

1584
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Just the situation of food.

1585
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
There are two principles.

1586
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
There will be 58 exceptions.

1587
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So the food algorithm.

1588
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Most of the time is to deal with those exceptions.

1589
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Then deal with those patterns you can see.

1590
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Since there will be a lot of people at this time.

1591
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Come in.

1592
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
You put a few more people there at this time.

1593
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Probably like this.

1594
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Yeah, but these things are definitely done.

1595
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's just that the requirements of food and mathematics.

1596
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Will be different.

1597
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You will also run some on food.

1598
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Is it simulating?

1599
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Will.

1600
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Because.

1601
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Now we are talking about food.

1602
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It has nothing to do with paper.

1603
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
These work hours on food are random.

1604
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
You said you want to send someone to the sea.

1605
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Bring a boat in.

1606
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
The historical data allows you to estimate.

1607
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
This is about 68 minutes.

1608
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
But in fact it may be 78 minutes.

1609
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It is possible for 52 minutes.

1610
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
In fact, it does have distribution.

1611
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Distribution will be received.

1612
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Who is the queen?

1613
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Who is the drinker?

1614
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
The size of the ship.

1615
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The impact of eating and stewing.

1616
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So it's really time to do.

1617
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Food algorithm.

1618
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You must do simulation.

1619
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
To be more reasonable.

1620
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
To evaluate the good and bad of the algorithm.

1621
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That's right.

1622
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
This sounds complicated.

1623
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I think so too.

1624
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
If you talk about food.

1625
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
You can talk about it again.

1626
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
There are a lot of strange things.

1627
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
For example.

1628
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
According to the reason.

1629
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
What time should the ship leave the port?

1630
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
After the drinker arrived at the scene.

1631
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I found out that his ship was still on and off.

1632
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
This is also very normal.

1633
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Or sometimes the ship will break down.

1634
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Then this.

1635
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Then the tower has already arranged.

1636
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This ship comes out first.

1637
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Then that ship goes in again.

1638
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Sometimes someone will be in line.

1639
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So it will be messy later.

1640
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
That's right.

1641
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
This is also at the airport.

1642
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Many times similar problems.

1643
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Oh yeah.

1644
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Airport.

1645
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
That is.

1646
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
There are people in the airport.

1647
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Then the plane takes off.

1648
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So the problem is quite similar.

1649
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Then this.

1650
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Airport.

1651
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
There will be a lot of unexpected things.

1652
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah.

1653
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Most of the time.

1654
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
There will be all kinds of if else.

1655
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
If something happens.

1656
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You do this and do that.

1657
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
OK.

1658
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1659
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Actually I still have a question.

1660
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
But I want to ask at the end.

1661
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Because it doesn't matter.

1662
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
If there is no question to ask.

1663
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Then let's thank Professor Kong first.

1664
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Wonderful speech.

1665
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Thank you all.

1666
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Happy youth.

1667
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Let's turn off the video first.

1668
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
OK.
