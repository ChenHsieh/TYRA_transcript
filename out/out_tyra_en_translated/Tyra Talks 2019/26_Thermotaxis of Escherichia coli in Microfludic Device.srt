1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
They can do this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Bacteria can get energy source.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So they can do thermotaxis.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is the result we just showed.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Bacteria will gather at intermediate temperature.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But the temperature they like,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which is the temperature they reject,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
will change with the temperature gradient.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Will change with the temperature gradient.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is our main result.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Of course, we have some control results.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What is the result of control?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For example,

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How do we know that bacteria change their preferences

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because of temperature gradient?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Maybe they change their preferences

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
because of temperature range.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The range is different from the gradient.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So we have to make sure

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that they don't change their preferences

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because of temperature range.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then we do the following experiment.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For example,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the temperature gradient is originally 59 to 19 degrees.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We change the temperature range,

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
but maintain the same temperature gradient.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
To see if the bacteria are concentrated at a similar temperature.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How do we do it?

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We put them at 5 degrees.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
From 59 to 19 degrees to 54 to 14 degrees.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In this way, the temperature gradient is still the same.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's all about 40 degrees difference.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But the average temperature drops.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Right?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's see the result.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The red one represents 31 to 48 degrees.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The blue one is 26 to 43 degrees.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Their temperature gradient is the same.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But the temperature range is different.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We will find that the temperature of the bacteria

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
in the red curve

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is about 37 degrees.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
37.5 degrees.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The blue one is 37 degrees.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
36 to 37 degrees.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So we claim that

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
although they are not completely overlapping,

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
their preferences for temperature are similar.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You will find that

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
there are some systematic differences

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
on the left and right.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mainly because

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
we surround the wall.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
These parts are close to the wall.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If they are close to the wall,

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
there will be a non-linear force

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
in theory.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But we don't discuss it here.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
OK.

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Finally,

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
we have to make sure that

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
although in theory,

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we have calculated that

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
bacteria need 300 seconds

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to complete the environment exploration

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
in this size.

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But it's still a theory.

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How do you know it's actually like this?

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right.

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So we did one thing.

71
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Before we take data at the end,

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
we take data in the middle first.

73
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What does it mean to take data in the middle?

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
After the bacteria enter the temperature

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
from the beginning,

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
it takes about 240 seconds

77
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to reach the middle.

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That is to say,

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
let's take a look at

80
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the time given to the bacteria

81
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in 240 seconds.

82
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Is the specific temperature

83
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the same as 360 seconds?

84
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If it's the same,

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
we claim that

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
at least between 240 to 360 seconds,

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the selection of temperature

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
has been fixed.

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That is, it has reached

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the equilibrium state.

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This proves that

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
although there is no complete overlap,

93
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
it is qualitatively the same.

94
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
At 240 seconds,

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
they like 31, 32 degrees.

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
At 360 seconds,

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
they like 31, 32 degrees.

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We choose the steepest temperature

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
for this temperature gradient.

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
OK.

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's about it.

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Conclusion.

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In our device,

104
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
because the people before

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
did a lot of experiments,

106
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but those devices

107
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
may not be well-defined.

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We want to provide

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
a well-defined experiment

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
to make sure

111
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
or improve

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the research on thermotaxis.

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We can create

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
a very linear

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and one drop,

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that is to say,

117
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
a gradient from left to right,

118
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
which is a very simple

119
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
temperature gradient.

120
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And this temperature gradient

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is very steep.

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The nutrients we use

123
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
are bacteria that

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
cannot grow inside.

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That is to say,

126
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
there is no chemo-attractant.

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So there will be less

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
confounding factors.

129
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then,

130
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the time we take,

131
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the bacteria need to reach

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the equilibrium time

133
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
is relatively short

134
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and reasonable,

135
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
about 300 to 400 seconds.

136
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Finally,

137
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
because of the H-filter,

138
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
all the bacteria we take

139
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
are all mobile bacteria.

140
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Our conclusion is that

141
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
bacteria can be

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
concentrated in

143
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
intermediate temperature.

144
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So it's different from

145
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the previous research.

146
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The previous research found that

147
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
bacteria will only be concentrated

148
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
in the hottest place.

149
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No matter how you increase the temperature,

150
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
it is concentrated in the hottest place.

151
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because of the relationship

152
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
between pseudo-thermotaxis.

153
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But we found that

154
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
it can actually be concentrated in the middle.

155
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
However,

156
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
what is more surprising is that

157
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the temperature they concentrate,

158
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that is, the temperature they like,

159
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
will change

160
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
with the temperature gradient.

161
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
OK, that's it.

162
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you.

163
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now,

164
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
let's see if there are any questions.

165
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wait a minute.

166
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's see if there are any questions.

167
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OK, do you have any questions

168
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
for the audience?

169
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then I have a question here.

170
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please ask.

171
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I just want to ask

172
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
why this experiment

173
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
is done with E. coli,

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
instead of other bacteria.

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, that's actually

176
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the reason.

177
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In 1976,

178
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
the reason is a bit

179
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
very simple.

180
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because in 1976,

181
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
when Maeda did the experiment,

182
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
he used E. coli.

183
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then people

184
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
might just want to learn it,

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
so they used E. coli.

186
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then I personally

187
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
as far as I know,

188
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the other reason is that

189
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
E. coli

190
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
moves at the fastest speed.

191
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So,

192
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
in the same scale

193
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and size environment,

194
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
E. coli takes less time

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to complete thermotaxis.

196
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So,

197
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
this is probably

198
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the main reason for using E. coli.

199
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because other bacteria

200
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
move too slowly.

201
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
OK,

202
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
so it's possible that

203
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
there is research

204
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that allows different bacteria

205
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
to move faster?

206
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't think so.

207
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not like that at the moment.

208
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
A lot of people do it.

209
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For example,

210
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
yeast,

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
which is yeast bacteria,

212
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
or the larger

213
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
thermotaxis for microorganisms.

214
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Or even C. elegans.

215
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But in terms of bacteria,

216
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
most people,

217
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I should say all people,

218
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
use E. coli.

219
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just different types.

220
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like we use 4, 3, 7.

221
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Some people use different types.

222
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh.

223
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So, in your field,

224
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you can hold a

225
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
bacteria race

226
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to see who can make

227
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
their own bacteria faster.

228
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They can't come out

229
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
because

230
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
their speed

231
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
is spread out.

232
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So,

233
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
they don't run in a straight line.

234
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right?

235
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But it depends on

236
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
who is faster.

237
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah.

238
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh,

239
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OK.

240
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Got it.

241
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Any other questions?

242
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yang Bo,

243
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have a question.

244
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
OK.

245
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you think

246
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that

247
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in your research,

248
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
what do you think

249
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is the hardest

250
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
or the biggest

251
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
challenge?

252
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is

253
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
a good question.

254
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The biggest problem

255
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I encountered

256
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
was

257
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the source of our nutrients.

258
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
At first,

259
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the source of our nutrients

260
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
was something called

261
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
lactic acid.

262
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But somehow,

263
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the bacteria

264
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
kept gathering

265
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
in the hottest place.

266
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So,

267
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
we kept thinking

268
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
why.

269
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then we found out

270
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
that lactic acid

271
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is a nutrient.

272
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So,

273
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
although it is a nutrient,

274
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the bacteria

275
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
don't like

276
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
too much lactic acid.

277
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Then,

278
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we found out

279
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that

280
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
there is

281
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
thermophoresis.

282
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That is to say,

283
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
if you put lactic acid

284
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
in the temperature,

285
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
most of the lactic acid

286
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
will be concentrated

287
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
in the lower temperature.

288
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Right.

289
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then,

290
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the bacteria

291
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
will go to the hotter side

292
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
because they don't like lactic acid.

293
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So,

294
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
we spent a long time

295
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to change our nutrients.

296
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We changed it to

297
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
lactic acid oil.

298
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Because lactic acid oil

299
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
doesn't seem to

300
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
attract or

301
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
exclude bacteria.

302
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So,

303
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
it doesn't matter

304
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
even if there is a drop.

305
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then,

306
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the second one is

307
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the measurement of temperature drop.

308
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We used a dye.

309
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But during the measurement,

310
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
before we know

311
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
thermophoresis,

312
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
we will find

313
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
the brightness of the dye.

314
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Because the density of the dye

315
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
will also change

316
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
because of temperature drop.

317
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But we didn't know at the beginning.

318
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So,

319
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the whole measurement

320
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
has been inconsistent with the theory.

321
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then,

322
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
when we found out,

323
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
everything became

324
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
smoother.

325
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
About these two points.

326
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right.

327
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is it OK?

328
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Dr. Yang,

329
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
you mentioned that

330
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
no one has used this method

331
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
before.

332
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You mentioned it before.

333
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Maybe I didn't hear it clearly.

334
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes.

335
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So,

336
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
if you are

337
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
a reviewer

338
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and you are asked

339
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
how to evaluate

340
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
this method

341
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
compared to

342
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the previous method,

343
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
is it better?

344
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you have any index

345
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
or what kind of measurement?

346
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We

347
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
probably

348
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
don't have any index.

349
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So,

350
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
we

351
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
probably use

352
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
if it is

353
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
in such a situation,

354
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
we should say

355
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
that

356
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
although our devices are the same,

357
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
but we use

358
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
a smaller magnitude.

359
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's a very

360
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
simple step.

361
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But it's

362
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
much better

363
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
than before.

364
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There is another

365
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
lucky thing

366
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
is that the reviewers

367
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
didn't ask this question.

368
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So,

369
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
we don't need

370
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to answer.

371
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes.

372
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But if you want to ask,

373
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
we should say

374
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that we have

375
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
controlled the magnitude well.

376
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Unlike before,

377
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
they used random magnitude.

378
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So,

379
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
they caused

380
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
some problems

381
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
that they couldn't

382
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
predict.

383
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

384
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you.

385
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

386
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Are there any other questions?

387
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have a question.

388
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please ask.

389
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So,

390
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you said that

391
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the biggest contribution

392
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
of your research

393
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is to

394
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
find

395
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the

396
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
right

397
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
thermal

398
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
test

399
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
on

400
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the

401
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
right

402
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
platform.

403
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes.

404
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Before doing

405
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
this experiment,

406
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
we

407
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
already

408
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
guessed

409
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
that bacteria

410
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
like 37 degrees.

411
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We need

412
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
someone to

413
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
prove this.

414
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But somehow,

415
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
there is no way.

416
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What we see

417
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
is not like this.

418
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So,

419
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
we feel strange.

420
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Is it because

421
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thermotex's mechanism

422
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and the

423
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
thermal test

424
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
on bacteria

425
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
are exactly the same

426
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
as Chemotex's?

427
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So,

428
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
before the experiment,

429
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
the theory has already

430
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
analyzed that

431
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
they should like 37 degrees.

432
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There are many

433
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
papers on

434
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thermotex's theory.

435
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But there is no experiment

436
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
that can prove this.

437
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So,

438
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
we

439
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
could have

440
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
proved this.

441
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But somehow,

442
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
we created

443
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a more complicated problem.

444
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That is,

445
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the temperature

446
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that bacteria like

447
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
is related to

448
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
the temperature.

449
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But at least,

450
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
we can prove that

451
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
they do like

452
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the temperature

453
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
but not

454
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
37 degrees.

455
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But,

456
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we can't prove

457
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that they do like

458
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
37 degrees.

459
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So,

460
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
we have to

461
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
go forward.

462
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

463
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I have a question.

464
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hello.

465
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hi.

466
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I have a question.

467
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I have a question.

468
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I have a question.

469
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I have a question.

470
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay.

471
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Please ask.

472
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You said that

473
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the temperature

474
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
that bacteria like

475
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
is related to

476
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
the temperature.

477
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes.

478
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes.

479
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So,

480
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
if we

481
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
can prove

482
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that

483
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
bacteria like

484
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
the temperature

485
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
but not 37 degrees,

486
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
is there a more

487
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
probable reason?

488
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Actually,

489
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
there is.

490
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Actually,

491
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,900
I have

492
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
explained this

493
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
to my boss.

494
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
But he didn't

495
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
want to add

496
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
it to the paper.

497
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
But I saw

498
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
the reviewer

499
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
was also asking about it.

500
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
So,

501
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
there is.

502
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Let me explain

503
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
why it happened.

504
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
So,

505
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
if you still remember

506
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
the pseudo-thermal text

507
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
mentioned

508
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
at the beginning,

509
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
that is,

510
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
without the ideal

511
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,900
temperature,

512
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
the bacteria will move around

513
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
and accidentally move

514
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
to the hottest place.

515
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Because the temperature

516
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
is high,

517
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
the bacteria move

518
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
slower.

519
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
The temperature is low,

520
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
the bacteria move

521
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
faster.

522
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
So,

523
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
the bacteria will

524
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
gradually move

525
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
to the high temperature.

526
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Let's call this

527
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
force 1.

528
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
This is the first example.

529
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
That is,

530
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
somehow,

531
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
there is an

532
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
invisible force

533
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
that pushes the bacteria

534
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
from low temperature

535
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
to high temperature.

536
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
At that time,

537
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
I claimed that

538
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
if there is another

539
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
force,

540
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
that is,

541
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
there is another

542
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
force that pushes the bacteria

543
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
from high temperature

544
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
to low temperature,

545
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
right?

546
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
I claimed that

547
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
this force

548
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
will increase

549
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
as the temperature

550
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
increases.

551
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
But the first force

552
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
will not increase

553
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
because the temperature

554
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
increases.

555
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
So,

556
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
it's a bit like

557
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
when you change the

558
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
temperature and temperature,

559
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
it's like these two forces

560
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
pulling each other.

561
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
When the temperature

562
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
and temperature

563
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
are small,

564
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
the phenomenon

565
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,900
of pseudo-thermal text

566
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,900
still dominates.

567
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Then they will

568
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
move to the high temperature.

569
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
When the temperature

570
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
increases,

571
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
the bacteria will

572
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
start to move

573
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
to the low temperature.

574
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
But when we

575
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
did the simulation later,

576
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
we found that

577
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
the distribution

578
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
is still different

579
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
from what we did

580
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
in the experiment.

581
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
So,

582
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
we didn't put it

583
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
on.

584
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
But I guess

585
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
this is

586
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
at least

587
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
a part

588
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
reason.

589
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Is this

590
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
OK?

591
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Yes.

592
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
OK.

593
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
OK.

594
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
OK.

595
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
OK.

596
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
OK.

597
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
OK.

598
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
OK.

599
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
OK.

600
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Thank you.

601
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
Hello.

602
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
I have a question.

603
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
OK.

604
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Go ahead.

605
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Based on

606
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Dr. Yang's

607
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
current research,

608
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
what do you think

609
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
is the next question

610
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
you want to

611
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
tackle?

612
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Next question?

613
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
In fact,

614
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
this device,

615
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
let me think about it.

616
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
There seemed to be

617
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
a lot of people at that time.

618
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
In fact,

619
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
at present,

620
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
we are

621
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
at the end of

622
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
the stage

623
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
of research.

624
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
But this is

625
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
actually very bad.

626
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Yes.

627
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
But if you want to

628
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
continue to study in the future,

629
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
I think the biggest

630
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
key should be

631
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
like

632
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
the question

633
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
that my classmate

634
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
just asked.

635
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
That is,

636
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
why do bacteria

637
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
choose different

638
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
temperatures

639
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
under different

640
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
temperature scales?

641
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Is it really

642
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
the reason

643
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
I just guessed?

644
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Or are there

645
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
more different

646
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
details?

647
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
At this time,

648
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
we may not

649
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
use this

650
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
statistical way

651
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
to do experiments.

652
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
It is more suitable

653
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
for experiments

654
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
with single bacteria.

655
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
That is to say,

656
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
you have to focus

657
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
on a bacterium,

658
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
give it a temperature scale,

659
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
and then you have to

660
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
trace it.

661
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
It's a bit like

662
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
recording.

663
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Look at it

664
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
in, for example,

665
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
a moving state

666
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
within 10 minutes,

667
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
and then the

668
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
direction of the

669
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
hair rotation.

670
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Because we can

671
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
use that to

672
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
determine

673
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
whether it is

674
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
swing or

675
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
tumble.

676
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
So it may be

677
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
a single cell

678
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
study.

679
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
That is,

680
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
you focus

681
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
on the

682
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
temperature scale

683
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
and see

684
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
how it

685
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
decides

686
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
the final

687
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
temperature

688
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
over time.

689
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Is there

690
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
any other

691
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
questions?

692
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Hi,

693
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
can I

694
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
ask a

695
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
question?

696
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
That is,

697
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
uh,

698
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
hello,

699
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
hello,

700
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
hi,

701
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
that is,

702
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I just

703
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
saw

704
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,900
that

705
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,900
you said

706
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,900
that

707
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
the

708
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
temperature

709
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
is

710
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
higher

711
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
than

712
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,900
the

713
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,900
temperature

714
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
.

715
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
I

716
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
want to

717
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
ask

718
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
that,

719
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
but I

720
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
think I

721
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
may have

722
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
missed

723
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
it,

724
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
that is,

725
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,900
uh,

726
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
you mentioned

727
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
that you

728
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
use that

729
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
container,

730
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
it is,

731
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
uh,

732
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
that buffer

733
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
is less

734
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
interference

735
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,900
than

736
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
the

737
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
bridge

738
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
medium

739
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
,

740
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,900
so

741
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
it

742
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
is

743
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
less

744
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
interference

745
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,900
than

746
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
the

747
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
bridge

748
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
medium.

749
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
So

750
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
I

751
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
think

752
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,900
that

753
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
the

754
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
bridge

755
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
medium

756
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
is

757
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
less

758
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
interference

759
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
than

760
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
the

761
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
bridge

762
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
medium.

763
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
So

764
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
I

765
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
think

766
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
that

767
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
the

768
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
bridge

769
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
medium

770
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
is

771
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
less

772
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
interference

773
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
than

774
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
the

775
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
bridge

776
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
medium.

777
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
So

778
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
I

779
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
think

780
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
that

781
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
the

782
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
bridge

783
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
medium

784
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
is

785
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
less

786
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
interference

787
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
than

788
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
the

789
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
bridge

790
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
medium.

791
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
So

792
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
I

793
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
think

794
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,900
that

795
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
the

796
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
bridge

797
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
medium

798
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,900
is

799
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
less

800
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
interference

801
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
than

802
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,900
the

803
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
bridge

804
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
medium.

805
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
So

806
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
think

1022
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
that

1023
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
the

1024
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
bridge

1025
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
medium

1026
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
is

1027
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
less

1028
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
interference

1029
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
than

1030
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
the

1031
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
bridge

1032
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
medium.

1033
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Thank you.

1034
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Thank you.

1035
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Thank you.

1036
