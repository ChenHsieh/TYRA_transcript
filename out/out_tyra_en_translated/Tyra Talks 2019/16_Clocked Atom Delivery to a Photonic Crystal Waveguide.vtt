00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, everyone. Good evening. Welcome to today's Tower Talk.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Today, we are very honored to have our speaker, Lucas Peng,

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
to talk to us about this. Basically, he just graduated from his doctorate thesis.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Clocked atom delivery to a photonic crystal waveguide.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And then there's the simulation part, and then there's the experimental part.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
And then he used to be in the Kimball Group at the California Institute of Technology, doing quantum optics.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
So let me introduce the background of Lucas Peng.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
Wait a minute, I'll turn it off.

00:45.000 --> 01:05.000
Lucas Peng's doctoral research is mainly focused on the quantum simulation platform by trapping atoms close to the surface of photonic crystal waveguide.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
And then after he got his doctorate, he went to a company in North Carolina called AO Sensing,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
which is currently developing quantum sensing technology.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Lucas Peng is actually a senior at the California Institute of Technology.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
He was originally a biophysicist at the University of Taiwan.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
And then after graduation, he went to Caltech and got his doctorate.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And now he's in North Carolina.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
He's going to talk to us about the topic I just talked about.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
If you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Otherwise, our speakers won't be able to hear you.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
So let's applaud and welcome Lucas Peng to give us today's speech.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Thank you.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay, you can start.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Thank you, Mr. Zhang, for giving me the opportunity to share my research.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
If you have any questions during my presentation, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
The topic I'm going to talk about today is my Ph.D. research.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
It's mainly about how to put color atoms near the photonic crystal waveguide.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
The main purpose is that if you can successfully capture the atoms near the photonic crystal waveguide,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
you can use it as a quantum simulation platform.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
First, I'm going to talk about our experimental system.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
This is the transparent photonic crystal waveguide.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
The atoms are trapped in the gap between the two waveguides.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
So let me first explain why this system is different from other systems,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
such as nanofiber or cavity QED.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
What's the difference? What's the advantage?

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And of course, what challenges will it bring?

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Next, I'm going to introduce a simulation program I developed.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
It simulates how atoms move near the photonic crystal waveguide.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
And it calculates a 2D spectrum using these simulations.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
After getting this spectrum, we can understand the behavior of atoms near the waveguide.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
Finally, it will show some experiment results and compare them with the simulation results.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Then we can see what conclusions we can get from it.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
First of all, the purpose of this research is to achieve a very strong interaction between light and atoms.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Why is this important?

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
In the study of quantum technology, such as quantum mechanics or quantum information,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
we usually use light to transmit quantum information.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
When the quantum information is transmitted, we hope it will be transferred to another system.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Because these systems have a longer lifetime,

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
the quantum information can be kept longer to do more processing.

04:00.000 --> 04:09.000
In the field of ML, one of the research directions is to transfer quantum information from light to atoms.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
To do this, we need a very strong interaction between light and atoms.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
Of course, the simplest way is to focus light on a very small area,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
which is about a wavelength.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Then put an atom in the focal length to interact with light and atoms.

04:26.000 --> 04:35.000
The limitation of this method is that the area of light is ultimately limited by the wavelength.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
In this way, the probability of interaction between light and atoms is very low.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
How to make this probability higher?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
One way is to put the atom in a cavity.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
You can imagine that the light is reflected in the cavity.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Every time the light passes through the atom, it will have one more chance to interact with the atom.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
In this way, the probability of interaction between light and atoms can be greatly increased.

05:01.000 --> 05:11.000
In addition to using a cavity, you can also use a resonator structure like this microtoray.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
In fact, it is a bit like a cavity.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The light will keep circling in this circle.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Every time the light passes through the atom, it will have one more chance to interact with the atom.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Another way is to increase the number of atoms.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
For example, the Rieper atom.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
As long as one of the atoms interacts with the light,

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
it will move to a high quantum number state.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
In this way, it can block other atoms and continue to interact with the light.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
So it seems that one atom can be equivalent to a huge atom.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
What I just said is that the light is reflected back and forth in the cavity.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
Another way is to imagine that the cavity changes the density of light.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So the atoms can have more states to interact with.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
This is another way to look at it.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
In addition to the cavity QED, there is another system called waveguide QED.

06:15.000 --> 06:23.000
The waveguide QED is a model that can be seen as a very thin fiber and an atom.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
When the light moves in this fiber,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
you can imagine that it has an input capacitor,

06:30.000 --> 06:38.000
a transmittance and a reflection capacitor.

06:38.000 --> 06:48.000
You can calculate the reflection formula of this system.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
The most important number in it is gamma1d.

06:50.000 --> 07:00.000
Gamma1d is the probability that the light will move to the fiber after the atom decays.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Because we want a very strong interaction between light and atoms,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
the higher the probability, the better.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
Gamma' is the probability that the light decays to other unnecessary states in space.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
The research of strong atom-photon coupling is to make gamma1d higher and better.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
How to make it higher?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
There are several ways to do it.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
One way is to reduce the molar area.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
The smaller the area, the higher the probability of interaction between light and atoms.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Another way is to reduce the proof velocity.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Proof velocity means that the slower the light moves in the fiber,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
the more chance it has to interact with the atoms.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
An important figure of merit is gamma1d to gamma'.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
The light decays to the state you want,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
which is the state in the fiber.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
The light decays to the state you want, which is the state in the fiber.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
The system we made in the lab is a finite crystal waveguide.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
What is the difference between a finite crystal waveguide and a normal light fiber?

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
The point is that the distance from the light fiber to the atom is limited by the wavelength.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
The ratio of gamma1d to gamma' is about 4% in the current experiment.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
90% of the light does not interact with the atom, but only passes through the atom.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
In theory, if the light can be captured very close to the finite crystal waveguide,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
gamma1d over gamma' can be increased to about 20.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
In this way, only 0.2% of the light will interact with the atom.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Why is gamma1d over gamma' so high?

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
The reason is that the finite crystal waveguide allows you to control the group velocity.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
For example, if the light is very close to the finite crystal band edge,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
the group velocity becomes very low.

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
For example, in our system, the group velocity can only be 1 tenth of the light.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Another reason is that the finite crystal waveguide can be made into a variety of shapes.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
You can design this shape to limit the light in a very small range.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
For example, the system we use allows the light to be concentrated in the middle gap.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
This allows the light to be limited to a smaller area than the wavelength.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
This can greatly improve the interaction between light and atoms.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
In this system, light is an atom, and it can reflect almost all light.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
You can imagine it as a quantum mirror.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
Waveguide QED, in addition to the finite crystal waveguide called Alligator,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
also has a variety of applications.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
For example, you can extend the heat of the light,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
and it will become a very thin light, the nano fiber.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
You can also put some trees in it.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
It will form some traps in the environment.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
This will capture the atoms around the light.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Another system, like Huffle's Looking Group,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
is also a finite crystal waveguide.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
They use an optical tweezer to hold the atom,

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
and drag it near the finite crystal waveguide.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
This allows it to interact with the guided mode in the finite crystal waveguide.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
At Purdue University, they also have a system

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
that uses an optical tweezer to capture the atoms

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
near the finite crystal waveguide.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Another special feature of the finite crystal waveguide is...

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
One more question.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
This is a general question.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
What kind of material do you use for structures like this?

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
It depends on what kind of waveguide you want to transmit the light.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
You want it to be as transparent as possible.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
For example, the CZM waveguide we use is 890nm.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
We use Zirconitride.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Got it. Thank you.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
So you can choose the material you want based on the wavelength you want.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
For example, we often use Telecom Waveband.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
You can also use materials like Silica.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
A special feature of the waveguide

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
is that you can design your waveguide

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
to have different wavelengths in different frequencies.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
For example, this is a bandstructure graph.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
The horizontal axis is the wave number,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
and the vertical axis is the frequency.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You can see that at this frequency...

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
For example, at a certain frequency, the light can't fall inside.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
This is a concept called bandgap.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
At the edge of the bandgap,

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
you can see that the dΩdk is equal to 0.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
This means that the group velocity is very small.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
So in this case, the density of states is very high.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
So if the frequency of the original wave is around here,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
you can imagine that it can interact with many states.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
This can greatly increase the probability of decaying to the state.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
So we usually design the FWG to have a bandgap

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
that is very close to the original wavelength.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
So you can imagine that the dΩdk can be outside the bandgap,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
or inside the bandgap.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
The first case is that when the dΩdk is outside the bandgap,

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
you can see that this frequency can be transmitted in the waveguide.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
For example, when the original wave goes from GF to GF,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
it emits a light.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
This light is at the frequency that can be transmitted,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
so it will move on the waveguide.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
So you can imagine that the interaction between the atoms on the waveguide is as strong.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
This is a region.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
Another region is that if you put the frequency of the atom's wavelength into the bandgap,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
because the light of this frequency cannot be transmitted inside the waveguide,

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
it will form an exponential decay light cloud near the atom.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So it's more interesting at this time.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
The farther the atoms are, the lower their interaction.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
The closer the atoms are, the longer the interaction.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
So you can imagine that this can have some local interaction.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Next, I will explain how to control the two atoms in this region

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
to produce a convenient interaction.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
So in theory, as long as you have a one-dimensional system,

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
you can let the atoms produce a Hamiltonian that can be engineered conveniently.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
Let's start with a simple example outside the waveguide.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
This is an experiment we did in our lab in 2015.

14:44.000 --> 14:53.000
The way to do this experiment is to use a laser beam to shine on the waveguide.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
It will form such an interference pattern.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
You can see that the interference pattern has some intensity maxima here and here.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
We call it Z1, Z2.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
If the laser frequency is slightly lower than the intensity of the atom,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
it will attract the atoms to the intensity maxima.

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
By this way, we will catch some atoms near the front crystal waveguide.

15:21.000 --> 15:27.000
This place is above the waveguide, so it's not in the middle of the waveguide.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
So in this place, γ1d over γ' is about 2.

15:30.000 --> 15:41.000
This means that when it decays, the probability of it decaying to the waveguide is 2 times higher than the probability of it decaying to the vacuum.

15:41.000 --> 15:51.000
What's interesting about this is that if the atoms are periodically caught on the front crystal waveguide,

15:51.000 --> 16:01.000
if the interference between them is the wavelength of the vacuum,

16:01.000 --> 16:10.000
an atom can interact with the entire collective state of the atom.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
In this way, the interaction will enhance the number of atoms.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
For example, if you have nA atoms, the interaction between them will increase nA times.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
But the number of atoms decays to free space is the same.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
So the more atoms you have, the more likely it is to decay to the waveguide.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
This is a phenomenon similar to superradiance.

16:33.000 --> 16:42.000
In this experiment, the number of atoms is used to control how long you have been caught.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
The longer you have been caught, the more likely the atom will escape your trap.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
So here you can see that when the atom is caught, the decay speed is very fast.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
When you let it go for a long time, the decay speed drops.

16:55.000 --> 17:05.000
We can see that when the number of atoms increases, the interaction between it and the state of the waveguide increases.

17:05.000 --> 17:14.000
You can do the same experiment in the same way.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
But this time we can adjust the bandage of the waveguide to the outside of the atom.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Although the wavelength frequency of the atom is inside the bandgap.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
At this time, you can see that there are two traces here.

17:28.000 --> 17:39.000
The green trace describes the intensity of the photon decay to the waveguide.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
The blue trace measures how long the interaction between the atoms is.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
The intensity of this interaction can be determined by the symmetry of the measured spectrum.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
If the interaction is stronger, the spectrum will not be symmetrical.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
So you can measure how strong the interaction between the atoms is.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
You can see that when the wavelength frequency of the atom enters the bandgap,

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
The photon does not decay to the waveguide.

18:09.000 --> 18:17.000
But the interaction between the atoms is still greater than the probability of the photon decaying to the waveguide.

18:17.000 --> 18:32.000
This means that in the bandgap region, the photon is still a potential decay cloud.

18:32.000 --> 18:45.000
Next, if you can put the atoms in the waveguide and form a string,

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
You can add a magnetic field to make each atom's Zeeman state different.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
For example, you can use an extra laser beam to add a sideband.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
The sideband can match the difference in the frequency of the Zeeman state between the atoms.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Then you can engineer the interaction between two random atoms.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
For example, the system here has a one-dimensional atom array.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
There are interactions between the two arrays.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
The interaction between the rightmost and the leftmost sideband can be simulated.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
It is a circular system.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
Excuse me, can I go back to the page?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I don't quite understand.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Wait a minute, I don't quite understand.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
You said two interactions.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Why does it become a circle?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
It doesn't overlap the last two interactions.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
For example, when you want to make two atoms interact,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
You have to let...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Take a look at this state first.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
There are three states in this atom.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
There are two ground states and one excited state.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
No, I know what's up there.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Oh, no, it's okay, I saw it.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Because my idea is,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Don't you all interact with the neighbors?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
How did it become a periodic boundary condition?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
That's how it becomes a circle.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
You're right.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
The beginning and the end also interact.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Yes, but it doesn't necessarily only interact with the neighbors.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Does it interact?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
It depends on the frequency of your guiding mode.

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
Does it resonate with the frequency of your other state?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
You can imagine that you can add a magnetic field.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
It's a gradient magnetic field.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Let every atom's Zeeman state have a slightly different frequency.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
So basically, you can just pick it up.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
You don't have to...

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
You can use an extra laser frequency to pick up the two atoms.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Oh, okay, okay, I see.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Hello, can I ask a question?

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
Is this similar to gradient echo memory?

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
It's a bit like spin echo.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
Gn, gradient echo memory, is a magnetic field that slowly increases.

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
Then every connection will have a slightly different splitting.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Yes, it's a bit like this.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Is there a difference between the two?

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
Who has the advantage?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I should say...

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
I just said that using a strong magnetic field to create a difference.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
But you don't have to use a magnetic field.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
You can use the AC source shape to let each state have a different frequency.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
In this case, you don't necessarily need a gradient.

21:53.000 --> 22:04.000
You can have a laser for each atom to generate different shapes.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Okay, thank you.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
Next, I will introduce the Delegator Functional Crystal Waveguide we use.

22:18.000 --> 22:26.000
This is what the whole system looks like.

22:26.000 --> 22:33.000
First of all, the whole system is hanging on the window in the middle of the chip.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
The way we interact with the waveguide is mainly through the light.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
The light is stuck to the chip.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
Then it can be coupled with the waveguide.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
You can see that there are many other structures on the waveguide.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
For example, there is a coupler here.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Then there are some mechanical structures here.

22:55.000 --> 23:03.000
The purpose of the coupler is to pull the device so that the two beams in the middle do not stick together.

23:03.000 --> 23:16.000
So this angle is optimized so that the center of the waveguide can maintain the gap.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
In addition, these structures are responsible for the heat generated by the laser.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
You will find that even if you only input a few microwave lasers,

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
Because the whole structure is very small, it will become very hot.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
This is a device, SEM.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
But you don't do active cooling, do you?

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
You just do it in the light.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
In fact, we still have to heat it up.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Because we can't cool it down.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
So sometimes you adjust the frequency to heat it up.

24:03.000 --> 24:10.000
After heating it up, you can change its bandage.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
So you don't just do it, but you don't want active cooling.

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
It's not that you can't do it, but we don't do active cooling.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
And there's a bad thing about being too cold.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
If you're cold, your laser will stick to it.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
So sometimes you want it to get hotter and hotter.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Excuse me.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Thank you.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
You said your structure is about a few hundred nanometers.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Then you said you need to use fiber.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Is it because this structure is very small?

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
You need to use evanescent wave to go in.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
With the effect of atoms.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Yes.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
Because in the end you want to send the light to the waveguide.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
So the way we use it is to put...

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
You can see it on this side.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
We stick the fiber to the chip.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Align it with the waveguide.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I was surprised at first.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
You think the fiber is big.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
The waveguide is only a few hundred nanometers.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
You think its mode doesn't match.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
But if you calculate the waveguide's mode.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
You find that the fiber's mode matches 90%.

25:28.000 --> 25:37.000
In fact, about 50% of the light can be sent to the waveguide.

25:37.000 --> 25:45.000
Is the light coming from the evanescent wave?

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Or is it a normal wave transmitted?

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Because it's single-mode fiber.

25:53.000 --> 26:00.000
It's like a mode built in fiber.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
It just came out and it's directly on the waveguide's mode.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
So as long as its mode is matched, it can continue to pass through the waveguide.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
It's not an evanescent wave.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
But it's not a Gaussian beam.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
It's a single-mode fiber in the waveguide.

26:18.000 --> 26:25.000
The mode depends on the gradient of the evanescent wave.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
This is an experiment photo.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
We stick the light on the chip.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
Mount it on a viewport.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
Then install the viewport into the vacuum chamber.

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
Let me briefly explain the CZM's energy level.

26:55.000 --> 27:04.000
The CZM's fine structure uses 6S and 6P states.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
6S is the ground state.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
6P is the fine structure.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Because of the spin-orbit coupling, there are two different connections.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
If you consider the hyperfine structure,

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
it's because of the nuclear spin and the electron spin.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
The ground state is subdivided into Fn3 and Fn4.

27:25.000 --> 27:33.000
The 6P state can also be divided into two connections.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
The upper one is divided into four connections.

27:37.000 --> 27:45.000
The lower frequency is called D1.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
The higher frequency is called D2.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
The design of the finite crystal waveguide allows D1 to correspond to a band edge.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
D2 corresponds to another band edge.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
You can imagine a simple idea.

28:03.000 --> 28:10.000
You use a band edge frequency, D1, to capture the atom.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
You use another frequency, D2, to trap the atom.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
For example, if you put D2's laser into the waveguide,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
and make it slightly blue detuned,

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
the atom will be pushed to the intensity minima.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
The atom will be trapped to the thickest point.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
You can use another band edge frequency, D1, to probe the atom.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Because D1 is another band edge,

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
the intensity will be stronger at the thickest point.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
In this case, you can use one frequency to capture,

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
and another frequency to detect the atom.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
Of course, this is a simplified model.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
There will be more details in the introduction.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
The main purpose of our experiment is to capture the atom in the finite crystal gap.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
And we hope that each size can capture an atom.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
If you can do this,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
you can think about promoting it to more complex systems,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
such as binary finite crystal.

29:22.000 --> 29:30.000
Here is a brief description of the basic atom cooling and capturing techniques used in the experiment.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
The methods used are MOP,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Dipole Trap,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Optical Lattice,

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
and a cooling technique called Degenerate Raman Side-In Cooling.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
MOP is a method of surrounding the atom group.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
There are six lasers in total.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
You can imagine that it is like a Doppler cooling in every direction.

29:57.000 --> 30:03.000
The atom going down will be absorbed by the light

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
and released from the inside,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
so it will get a momentum kick,

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
and it will be cooled.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
The purpose of adding this magnetic field is to introduce a space-dependent shift

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
to generate confinement.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
If you have confinement and cooling,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
you can make a MOP.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
Another concept is Optical Dipole Trap.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
As I just explained,

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
if the frequency of the laser is slightly lower than the frequency of the atomic moon,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
it will produce a shift to your connection.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
In this case,

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
the ground state will shift down,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
and the excited state will shift up.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
You can see that in the ground state atom,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
it will produce a space-dependent potential.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
At this time, the frequency of the atomic moon can also change.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
I will talk about how to help us understand where the atom is in space.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
For example, if the frequency of the laser is slightly lower than the frequency of the atomic moon,

31:10.000 --> 31:18.000
the atom will be sucked into the Intensity Maxima.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
If the light is Blue Detuned,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
the atom will be blown away by the Intensity Maxima.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
So if there is Intensity Minima in your potential,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
the atom will be gathered in that place.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
There are different configurations.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
The simplest is Gaussian Beam.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
It can produce a trap.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
In the lab, we use two lasers to form a standing wave.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
At this time, the atom can be captured in the standing wave.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
It looks like a lattice.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
This is called Optical Lattice.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
After the atom is caught in the Optical Lattice,

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
we still need to cool it.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
The cooling method we use here is called Degenerate Raman Sibon Cooling.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
This is a very ingenious way.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
The way is that you can add a magnetic field

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
to produce a little change in the connection between atoms in different MF states.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
If the difference in energy between each MF state

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
is just equal to the energy of the H-bar omega

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
that vibrates in your Optical Lattice,

32:22.000 --> 32:28.000
you can see that the vibrating state of under 1

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
is the same energy as the under 0 state of the next MF state.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
At this time, you can use the Raman Transition method

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
to transfer the atom from n equals 1 to the under 0 state

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
and then pump it back.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
After this cycle,

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
the atom can reduce the vibration frame.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
By repeating this process,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
in theory, you can cool the atom

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
to the vibration state in your trap.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
By doing this,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
we can cool the atom in the Optical Lattice.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
Once the atom is trapped in the Optical Lattice,

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
the way we experiment here is to move the Optical Lattice.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
As long as you change one of the laser frequencies,

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
the entire interference pattern will start to move.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
We can use this method to let the atom pass through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
The purpose is that

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
each piece of the Optical Lattice's MF

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
is called a pancake.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
For example, there are 500 atoms in it.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Of these 500 atoms,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
only a small part will interact with the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
But in the experiment cycle,

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
there are 2000 pancakes passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Through this method,

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
we can try to let more atoms interact with the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

34:00.000 --> 34:06.000
This is a simple picture of our experiment.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
First, we make a MOD of the atom in the Source Chamber.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
Then we use a laser to kick it into another MOD in the main chamber.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Then we cool the atom in the MOD

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
and trap it in the Optical Lattice.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
The Optical Lattice is a beam of two lasers.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
Once the atom is caught in the Optical Lattice,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
we change the frequency of one of the lasers

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
and move the atom near the device.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
When the atom is near the device,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
we can put a few beams into the waveguide.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
One of the beams is a Probe Laser.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
This laser adjusts the frequency of D1 of the DZM.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
If the atom is near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
it will absorb the light of the Probe.

35:00.000 --> 35:07.000
We can use the amount of Probe through the waveguide

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
to measure how many atoms interact with the waveguide.

35:12.000 --> 35:19.000
We can also put various trapped potentials into the waveguide.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Another important component is that

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
when the Optical Lattice passes through the waveguide,

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
some light will be emitted into the waveguide.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
We can also detect the light emitted by the Optical Lattice.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
Through this light, we can know which part of the Optical Lattice is passing through the waveguide.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Is it passing through the waveguide at the peak?

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Or is it passing through the waveguide at the valley?

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
Through this, we can have more data to understand

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
how the atom moves near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
This is an experimental result.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
We can see that the atom passes through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy at T20.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
The horizontal axis is the time,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
and the vertical axis is the frequency of the Probe Beam.

36:08.000 --> 36:15.000
We can turn the Probe Beam from negative 50 MHz to positive 50 MHz detuning.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
The atom passes through the waveguide at T20.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
This is the data from one of the photodials.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
The photodial specifically detects the light emitted by the Optical Lattice.

36:30.000 --> 36:36.000
When the atom passes through, it generates a periodic signal.

36:36.000 --> 36:43.000
The frequency of this signal depends on how fast the Optical Lattice passes through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
For example, we are using a frequency of about 1.2 MHz to move the Optical Lattice.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
The signal is 1.2 MHz.

36:56.000 --> 37:06.000
Through this signal, we can know what time the atom is passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
Note that the time scale here is microsecond.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
The time scale on the right is millisecond.

37:14.000 --> 37:22.000
So there are thousands of Optical Lattice pancakes passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy in these two Blobs.

37:26.000 --> 37:37.000
Do you know the number of atoms in each Blob?

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
We can know how many atoms are near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

37:43.000 --> 37:52.000
At any time, there may be one or two atoms passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

37:52.000 --> 38:02.000
We estimate that each pancake will have one atom passing through the gap of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
This is where we really want to catch the atoms.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
The reason why we use Optical Lattice is to get a cycle.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
For example, each pancake can catch one atom in the gap.

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
If 100 pancakes pass through the gap, we can catch 100 atoms.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
The purpose of this experiment is to find a trapping cycle.

38:27.000 --> 38:33.000
So that each Optical Lattice cycle can catch one atom.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
Of course, we haven't reached this goal yet.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
But my PhD research is moving in this direction.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
We just saw that the setup of the experiment can produce such an experiment result.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
How do we interpret this experiment result?

38:55.000 --> 39:05.000
Through simulation, we can help us understand how these atomic trajectories correspond to the experimental results we get.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
This simulation is a Monte Carlo simulation.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
The atoms are scattered in the Optical Lattice.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
They are then formalized and moved to the vicinity of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
According to the Optical Dipole Potential, each atom moves.

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
Finally, we collect these trajectories and calculate the spectrum we should get.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
The concept of simulation is very complicated.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
But there are some challenges in practice.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
Because it is a periodic potential,

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
you need to measure a large area for the atoms to formalize in this potential.

39:52.000 --> 39:58.000
For example, our simulation domain is a few tens of microns.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
But the Phonar Crystal is a very small device.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
Its size is a few hundred nanometers to a micron.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
So the whole experiment is very memory-intensive.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
So most of the time, it is optimized to use as little data as possible.

40:15.000 --> 40:24.000
The concept of simulation is to let the atoms simulate how they move from a faraway place to the vicinity of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

40:25.000 --> 40:36.000
Then simulate various Optical Dipole Force and Probing Beam Profile to calculate the spectrum you will get.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
You can also do 3D simulation.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
For example, this is a simulation result.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
You can see the lines here are the atomic trajectories.

40:47.000 --> 40:54.000
The atomic trajectories can be subdivided into different types of trajectories.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
For example, these green trajectories are the gaps in the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
These are the atoms we are most interested in.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
The other blue trajectories are the ones that go around the outside of the device.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
The red ones are the ones that hit the surface of the device.

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
Next, we're going to use these trajectories to calculate a spectrum.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
How do you calculate the spectrum?

41:20.000 --> 41:27.000
You can distribute the atomic trajectories to the top of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
For example, there are a few atoms here.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
You can use a matrix to represent each segment of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
This matrix is called the transfer matrix.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
The Phonar Crystal Lake guy has its own transfer matrix.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Each atom has its own transfer matrix.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
The transfer matrix of the atoms depends on the location of the atoms.

41:48.000 --> 41:59.000
We can see that the Gamma 1D is determined by the strength of the probe at that location.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
The distance between the atoms near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy determines the strength of the Gamma 1D.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
The transfer matrix of each atom is different.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
If we multiply all these matrices, we get the total transfer matrix.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
From there, we can get the transmission and reflection of the entire system.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
Next, let's see what the simulation results will be.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.000
I just explained how to get the atomic trajectories through simulation.

42:33.000 --> 42:41.000
Next, I will explain how to connect the results of our experiment through simulation.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
Here is a tool we use.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
We call it the Clock Spectrum.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Why is it called Clock?

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
Because our apical lattice sends the atoms near the device.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
The atoms are cyclically sent near the Phonar Crystal.

43:00.000 --> 43:06.000
For example, if your chirping frequency is 1MHz, each micron will have an atom passing through.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
Theoretically, you can get a cyclic signal.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
The cyclic signal depends on the frequency of the atoms coming to your device.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
For example, if we look at the light coming out of the probe and make it into a histogram,

43:23.000 --> 43:31.000
we can see that the frequency of the apical lattice is a cyclic signal.

43:31.000 --> 43:38.000
We can also detect the apical lattice signal through another photodiode.

43:38.000 --> 43:48.000
This gives us a clock so that we can know which part of the apical lattice is passing through our waveguide.

43:48.000 --> 44:01.000
If you fold the signals of each microsecond into an apical lattice period, you can get a histogram.

44:02.000 --> 44:20.000
The histogram tells you how many atoms are interacting with the device at different times in the apical lattice frequency.

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
If you do this experiment for each detuning, you can get a two-dimensional spectrum.

44:27.000 --> 44:38.000
In this two-dimensional picture, the horizontal axis is the time, and the vertical axis is the probe detuning.

44:38.000 --> 44:45.000
This two-dimensional spectrum can convey some information about the atoms moving near the Phonar Crystal waveguide.

44:45.000 --> 44:52.000
The next step is to find out how to match the atomic trajectory to the two-dimensional spectrum.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
There are different modes for this experiment.

44:57.000 --> 45:04.000
As mentioned earlier, we let the bandage correspond to the transition of C-joint D1 and D2.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
Another mode is polarization.

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
As mentioned earlier, the bandage corresponds to when the polarization is parallel to the waveguide.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
If it is perpendicular, there will be another bandgap.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
However, this bandgap is far from the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2.

45:23.000 --> 45:32.000
So for this proof, the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Here you can see TE mode.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
D1 and D2 are bandage modes.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
The frequency of D1 and D2 has a very obvious x-direction structure.

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
For example, D2's intensity is concentrated in the thin part.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
D1's intensity is concentrated in the thick part.

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
We mainly use these two modes to probe and capture the atoms.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
TE mode, you can see that it is almost uniform in the direction of the waveguide.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
TE mode, you can see that it is almost uniform in the direction of the waveguide.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
Because the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is far from the TEM bandgap,

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.

46:25.000 --> 46:32.000
This mode is different in that its intensity is the strongest above and below the waveguide.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
So it has a very useful feature that can help us protect the surface of the device.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
If you let it be a blue-D-chain, it can bounce away the atoms near it,

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
so that it won't stick to the surface of the device.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
At the same time, it can produce a large A-structure inside the gap and outside the gap,

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
so that we can detect how many atoms pass through the gap.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
This is a detail.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
We just said that using a mode to do trapping is actually a simplification.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
We need to combine two modes to produce a stable trap on the three-dimensional surface.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
We need to combine two modes to produce a stable trap on the three-dimensional surface.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
There is another interesting challenge.

47:16.000 --> 47:23.000
We found that to produce a trap, the energy of two modes must have a ratio.

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
If there is no ratio, the trap will not be a stable trap.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
But there is a problem.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
The intensity of different frequencies coupled to the waveguide is different.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
So we can't directly measure how much light is in the waveguide.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
So how do we know the intensity ratio of two modes?

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
By combining the experiment results and simulation results,

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
we can know how strong the light in the waveguide is.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
Another purpose of the experiment is to tell us the timing.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Here is a way of trapping.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
When the atom enters the middle of the waveguide,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
for example, it is in the state f4.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
When the atom is in the middle, we pump it to the excited state at the right time.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
When the atom is in the middle, we pump it to the excited state at the right time.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
We can see that the atom is pumped from a light potential to a deep potential.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
At this time, the atom can be trapped.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
Otherwise, the atom will come in and go out again.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
Because this is a conservative potential.

48:30.000 --> 48:38.000
To get this result, we need to know the time of the atom passing the gap.

48:38.000 --> 48:46.000
The same simulation can tell us the time of the atom passing the gap.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Let's look at this first.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I have a question.

48:55.000 --> 49:01.000
Does your simulation include interference?

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
For example, environmental, thermal, radiation, etc.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
Because I don't know what is the background interference of Dominant.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Does it include?

49:12.000 --> 49:19.000
Thermal radiation, compared to other modes,

49:19.000 --> 49:27.000
For example, the strength of the output lattice is hundreds of milliwatts.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
The Guided Mode contains several microwatts.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
Their intensity is much greater than thermal radiation.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
So we don't need to consider thermal radiation.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
Is there any other known interference that needs to be considered?

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
There is one.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It can't be classified as interference.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
This is a big factor.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Casper-Poller force.

49:49.000 --> 49:55.000
The atom is very close to the attraction force.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
If you don't consider the attraction force, the result will be quite different.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
I didn't think of it at first.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
But later I found it to be a very important factor.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
I see. Thank you.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
There are some interference factors.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
For example, the vibration of the device.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
We can think of it as a suspension line.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
If it heats up, it may vibrate.

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
We have measured the frequency of its vibration.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
I found that it is much greater than the frequency of the atom vibrating in the trap.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
So we don't need to consider it for the time being.

50:41.000 --> 50:47.000
Let's explain how to calibrate these three different modes.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
I want to introduce a simple question first.

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
The question is how to calibrate the optical lattice beam.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
This is not a calibration.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Because we already know how strong the optical lattice beam is.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
It's just a way to verify that this is a feasible method.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
This is a simulation result.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.000
The density of the atom here is much greater than the real density.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
The real density is only about one-tenth.

51:12.000 --> 51:19.000
This simulation result can let us know how the atom moves near the device.

51:19.000 --> 51:26.000
The potentials used in this simulation are two optical lattices and the Kessler-Potter force I just mentioned.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
The atom will be attracted when it is very close to the device.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
The attraction is the blue potential around it.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
It is a very strong potential.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
On the right, we can see the simulated clock spectrum.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
The atom is attracted by the optical lattice.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
So it's not coming one by one.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
We can think of it as passing through the final crystal.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
It will cause the biggest absorption.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
It's not zero detuning.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Because the optical lattice is red detuning.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
So it brings a blue detuning.

52:12.000 --> 52:19.000
As mentioned before, the red detuning potential will reduce the ground state.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
But the excited state will be higher.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
So the overall frequency will also increase.

52:24.000 --> 52:30.000
So we can see that the frequency of the atomic transition is a positive detuning.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Here we can see that it's going down.

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
This is a phenomenon caused by the Kessler-Potter potential.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
The Kessler-Potter potential is also an attractive potential.

52:43.000 --> 52:51.000
If the excited state doesn't change, the frequency of the atomic transition will also increase.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
So it's a red detuning.

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
The reason is that the Kessler-Potter potential affects the excited state.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
For the cesium D1 transition,

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
the change in the excited state is actually twice the ground state.

53:07.000 --> 53:14.000
So the decrease in the excited state is actually twice as much as the decrease in the ground state.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
So in fact, the frequency of the atomic transition is getting smaller.

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
So under the influence of the Kessler-Potter potential, the detuning is negative.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
We can see that the left is the result of the experiment.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
So we find that the two are actually quite matched.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
And the size of the detuning is the same.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
This means that the parameters of the simulation and the experiment are the same.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
At this time, we can measure something we don't know.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
For example, we can measure the length of the TM guided mode.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
This is a simulation of the TM guided mode.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
The TM guided mode is a blue detuning.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
So it generates a negative Kessler-Potter potential above and below the waveguide.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
So we can see that the atoms are ejected by the Kessler-Potter potential.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
At the same time, it changes the direction of the atoms entering the gap.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
The picture on the right is a comparison of the simulation and the experiment.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
We can see that the simulation of the two-dimensional surface is actually very similar.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
So their differences are not detailed.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
However, we can see that the simulation and the experiment are very similar.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
We can see that after adding this potential,

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
it has some impact on the two-dimensional Kessler-Potter potential.

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
The biggest impact is that you can see that it generates a feature that goes down.

54:43.000 --> 54:54.000
This feature is caused by the difference in time when the atoms are ejected by the Kessler-Potter potential.

54:56.000 --> 55:08.000
Now we can compare the light energy of the experiment with the simulation.

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
We can see that the light intensity of the simulation is actually less.

55:15.000 --> 55:22.000
This is because the light intensity measured in the experiment is the light intensity in the fiber.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
The light intensity in the waveguide is actually much less.

55:26.000 --> 55:33.000
So we can estimate that the fiber coupling efficiency is about 30%.

55:33.000 --> 55:40.000
The efficiency is the same as measured in other ways.

55:42.000 --> 55:48.000
In this way, we can directly measure the intensity of the light energy in the device.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
What kind of trajectory does this feature correspond to?

55:57.000 --> 56:04.000
We can see that the blue feature corresponds to the blue trajectory on the right.

56:04.000 --> 56:11.000
They are outside the device, so they see less guided modes and receive less AC short-circuits.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
The trajectory that climbs up is the blue guided mode,

56:16.000 --> 56:24.000
so it sees a longer value chain, and the frequency is getting lower and lower.

56:24.000 --> 56:34.000
In the middle gap, the AC short-circuit corresponds to the green result.

56:34.000 --> 56:44.000
We can see that we can use this method to know the time and location of the atoms near the device.

56:44.000 --> 56:51.000
There are about 100 ns time resolution and 50 ns space resolution.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
We can use the same method to do TMO.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
We can see that it matches quite well.

57:02.000 --> 57:10.000
Interestingly, we found that the intensity of the energy in the device is much more than what we put into the experiment.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
But this is not surprising, because we are using TEMO.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
TEMO's D1 detour is on the band edge.

57:20.000 --> 57:26.000
Because the band edge's group velocity becomes smaller,

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
the intensity of the light inside will be enhanced.

57:30.000 --> 57:36.000
The intensity of the light inside the VGAI is greater than what we put into the experiment.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
This tells us that there is a slow light effect.

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
As I said, there are different types of trajectories.

57:44.000 --> 57:51.000
We can separate them in the simulation to see what each of them contributes to the flux vector.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
For example, the contribution caused by the middle atom,

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
the contribution caused by the outer atom, and the contribution caused by the other blue atoms.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
This is a very important feature.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
This is a very important feature.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
It tells us if there is really an atom passing through the gap.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Because this is the atom we want to capture.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
So we want to know if there is really an atom passing through the gap.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
We can find that if we take a cut at this time,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
you will find that there are two dips.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
The simulation tells us that one of the dips mainly comes from the contribution of the middle atom.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
The other dip is the contribution of other atoms.

58:33.000 --> 58:39.000
So we can observe that there are two dips at this time in the experiment.

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
So it can tell us that there are indeed atoms passing through the gap in the middle.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
By comparing the simulation results,

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
we can estimate that each pancake will have one or two atoms passing through the gap.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
At the same time, the simulation also tells us

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
when to pump the atom into the deeper trap.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
The position of the dip tells us the AC structure over there.

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
So it tells us what frequency of the laser should pump the atom into the deeper trap.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
By comparing the simulation and the experiment,

59:19.000 --> 59:25.000
First, we can calibrate the strength of the guided mode to create the trap we want.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Second, it tells us when to pump the atom.

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
Third, it tells us what detuning to use to pump the atom into the trap.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Finally, let's talk about the more unexpected result.

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
We can probe how strong the Kasper-Potter force is.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
For example, there are two simulations.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
The right one has no Kasper-Potter force.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
The left one has Kasper-Potter force.

59:50.000 --> 59:57.000
The difference is that there is a feature that goes down here.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
We found that this feature does appear in the experiment.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
By comparing the two features,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
we can get the Kasper-Potter potential.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
The potential coefficient is the same as mentioned in the simulation.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Finally, let's talk about the new research I did when I left.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
A new way to put the chip into the vacuum chamber is very troublesome.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You have to stick 16 fibers to the U-Port and then put it into the chamber.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
It usually takes us two days.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The new generation of experiments does not require light.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
You can directly focus the laser on the coupler with the microscope objective.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
You can directly couple from the vacuum chamber to the waveguide.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
This can greatly reduce the time it takes to replace the chip.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It also provides more optical access.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
We can put more beams and have closer observation.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Another way is that we can use optical tweezers instead of optical lasers.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
The advantage of optical lasers is that it gives us a lot of atoms in a short time.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
The advantage of optical lasers is that it gives us a lot of atoms in a short time.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
It can extract the information I just mentioned.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
If you want to fine-tune the position of the atoms, you can use optical tweezers.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You can fine-tune the position of the atoms on the one-dimensional waveguide.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
In this way, you can probe the interaction between two atoms more directly.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
This is a summary of the applications of the two-dimensional waveguide.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
This is a summary of the two-dimensional waveguide.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
First, I talked about why we want to do Strong Atom Photon Interaction.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Then, I explained how we send the atoms near the waveguide.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Next, I will introduce a numerical simulation.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
This is a numerical simulation to simulate the trajectory of the atoms.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Then, calculate a two-dimensional spectrum from these trajectories.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Then, calculate a two-dimensional spectrum from these trajectories.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It can help us adjust the strength of the guided mode.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It can help us understand the behavior of the atoms near the waveguide.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It can help us understand the time and how the neutrino pumps the atoms into the trap.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It can help us understand the attraction force of the atoms near the dielectric.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Thank you.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Let's applaud to thank our speaker today.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Please turn on the microphone.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Then, we can hear your applause.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Thank you for giving us this wonderful speech.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Next, we are going to have a Q&A.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Before we start, let me advertise something.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We welcome you

and we need you to share

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
the results of your research.

You can find the way to join

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
on our Facebook page

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and our website.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Now, let's start the Q&A.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Any questions?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I have a question.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
What you just said

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
is using Optical Lattice

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
to deliver your origin

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
to the photonic crystal?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The ultimate goal is to deliver it

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
to the gap between the two photonic crystals

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
and let the origin stay in the gap.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
The current method is...

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Is it possible to easily control

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
the gap between your lattice

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
and the gap between your crystals?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
This is...

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
This is Optical Lattice's...

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
It consists of two Gaussian beams.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
We put the photonic crystal waveguide

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
on the position of the Gaussian beam.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The position of the beam

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
is about 60 microns.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
The size of the device

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
is about 1 microns.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Most of the origin

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
does not pass

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
near the photonic crystal waveguide.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But when each pan can pass,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
dozens of them

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
will appear near the waveguide.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Among those dozens,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
one or two may run into the gap.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I think it can be delivered one-to-one.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
This is very difficult.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Because the gap is 200 nanometers.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The wavelength is not that small.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Even if you can focus on

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
the wavelength,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
the Rayleigh Lambda will be very small.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So you can't...

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It's impossible to load

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
such a large mod

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
into the Optical Lattice.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
After loading,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
the Rayleigh Lambda is about 2 nanometers.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It takes thousands of pancakes

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
to deliver one-to-one.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
If you focus on such a small wavelength,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
it's a bit like

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
what I just mentioned,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
the optical tracer.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
The optical tracer focuses on

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
the wavelength.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Relatively speaking,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
you can only trap one ray

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and put it near the waveguide.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It has its advantages.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
The difficulty is that

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
you have to catch a ray

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
and move the ray

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
to the waveguide.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You can't lose the ray.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
So it's difficult.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Okay, thank you.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I have a question.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I want to ask...

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You said your goal is

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
to achieve strong

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
metroid interaction.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I want to ask

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
your long-term goal is

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
when you achieve strong interaction,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
what do you want to do with it?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
The main goal is

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
to simulate

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
the system of

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
many-body physics.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
In addition to

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
the simulation of

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
quantum magnetism,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
there is another

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
interesting experiment.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
For example,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
the cavity QED

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
is a classical object

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
with a large diameter.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
You can imagine

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
if you catch five atoms

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
and put a side in the middle,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
the middle is an atom again,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and the side is five atoms.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The five atoms on the left and right

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
is like a black mirror.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
That means the atom

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and the mirror

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
are quantum objects.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
This is very interesting.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Through what I said,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
you can create

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
pairwise Hamiltonian

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
in quantum simulation.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
You can create

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
various quantum simulations

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
in pairwise Hamiltonian.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
There is another interesting

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
application that I didn't mention.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
This is different from

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
the general waveguide QD,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
because it has a

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
dielectric structure.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
This dielectric structure

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
forces the intensity of the light

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
to stick to the structure.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So you can make

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
the distance between the atoms

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
smaller than the wavelength

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
of free space.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
This is an interesting phenomenon.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The light radiated

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
to the free space

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
is interfered by the atoms.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
This can greatly reduce

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
the intensity of spontaneous emission.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
This is something

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
that general waveguide QD

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
can't do.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
If you can

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
greatly suppress

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
the frequency of decay

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
to free space,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
you can make

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
a quantum memory system.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Do you have any questions?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
If not,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I have a question.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Can you jump to the

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Kashmir Force page?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
You can explain

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
what you want to convey

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
in this page.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
How do you see this?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
At the beginning of the simulation,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
we didn't add

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
the Kashmir Force page.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
You can see that

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
this simulation

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
is the simplest

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
one.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
We didn't add any

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
guide mode,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
only probe and optical lattice.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
The optical lattice

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
is ready-tuned.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
The light in the whole system

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
is ready-tuned.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
All the atoms we see

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
should have

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
the same

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
probe frequency

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
to see the atoms.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But we found that

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
they all fall down.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I found that

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
this is the Kashmir Force.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
The Kashmir Force

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
is an attraction.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
The amount of excited state

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
is more than ground state.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It can make

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
the probe frequency

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
decrease.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
You can see the redshift frequency.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
At the same time,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
you can see the same phenomenon in CM.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
If I ask

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
in this way,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
if you don't add Kashmir Force,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
the simulation resolution

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
will be too high.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
If you compare the experimental data,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
how much inconsistency

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
does it have?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
For example,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
we don't know how strong

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
the caterpillar coefficient is.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
We can extract it in this way.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I'm very interested in this.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
We can get a number

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
which is difficult to measure.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
There is a reason.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The caterpillar

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
has a

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
potential

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
which is

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
1 over z3.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It's a

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
1 over z3

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
dependent.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It's a

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
very fast

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
potential.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
The closer it is to the origin,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
the faster it runs.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The interaction time

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
with the deep place is very short.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
The shift here is

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
negative 20

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
megahertz.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
It corresponds to

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
1 millikelvin.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I don't remember

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
the distance.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Maybe it's

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
outside of dozens of nanometers.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
It's almost gone.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
We can match

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
the approximate value.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
If you want to match it accurately,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
it's hard to do it in this way.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Do you publish this?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Can I find the details?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Yes, we have

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
a paper in PNAS

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
which mentions this.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
You can send me the link later.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
The purpose of the paper is not to measure this.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I know.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
My idea is

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
there is a potential

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
which can be optimized

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
to Casimir force detector.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Obviously, this is not the purpose.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
It looks like there is a chance.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I'm interested in

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Casimir force

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
coupled to new physics.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I remember there is a paper

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
which uses blue evanescent field

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
to balance the atoms.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It can measure

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Casimir force in this way.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It's a bit tiring.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
We can't design

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
a stable trap

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
to balance it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
There is a potential

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
which can be optimized

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
to Casimir force.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I think it's cool.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
We can discuss it later.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Do you have any questions?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
If you don't have any questions,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
please turn on the microphone.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Let's give a round of applause

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
to Peng Lu for his speech.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Thank you.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Thank you.
