00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello, I'm Ted. I'm very happy to be here today. I'd like to welcome Chen Junjia from the University of Amsterdam.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
This is his last year at Pomeranian. Yay!

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
I've known him since he was in university. He's also a student at the Electrical Engineering Department.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
I'm very happy to have someone with me to talk about physics.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Junjia is studying Atomic Physics.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
I've done a little bit of it in the beginning, but it's a lot different from what I did in IELTS and BEC.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I think BEC is very cool in physics.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
You've been in this field for over 20 years now, right? How long have you been in BEC?

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
It's been over 20 years since 1995.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, okay.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
But it's been a long time since people wanted to do it. It was only made in 1995.

01:06.000 --> 01:17.000
Junjia's topic for today is Steady-State Ultracold Cesium Near Quantum Degeneracy.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
He's talking about the application in CW atom lasers and clocks.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
His lab is one of the latest quantum flagships in Europe.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
So maybe we can hear some new things and see what Europe plans to do in this area.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
I won't say much more. Junjia, please get ready to start your speech.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Thank you.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
First of all, I'd like to thank Jianyuan for giving me the opportunity to introduce the topic I'm doing.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
First of all, I'd like to make a correction. What I'm doing is Strontium, not Cesium.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
Strontium is a 2A element.

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
The purpose of our experiment is, as I said in the title, to achieve a steady-state.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
In principle, the ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous atomic laser.

02:26.000 --> 02:36.000
Of course, before you reach that ultimate goal, you have to reach the Bose-Einstein connection in the first phase.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
This is something that hasn't been achieved yet.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
In principle, our lab hopes to challenge it.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
In principle, our lab hopes to challenge it.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
As I mentioned in the title, the ultimate goal is to achieve a steady-state.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
In principle, we are already very close to quantum degeneracy.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Of course, we haven't reached it yet.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
But in principle, I will briefly report on our current progress.

03:10.000 --> 03:21.000
Of course, I will also mention some applications of CW, Atom Laser, and CLOX on the technology we have developed.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
The title is of course our lab, our overall experimental setup.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Let's take a look.

03:30.000 --> 03:40.000
Of course, we have a step on the experiment.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
In principle, we have used some of the cooling mechanisms of CISPOS.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
I will briefly introduce it in the next speech.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
First of all, this is the outline of my talk today.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
I will briefly explain who we are, where we are, and why we want to do these things.

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
Next, I will briefly mention the technologies we use, such as laser cooling and BEC.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
In principle, I will mention two applications that I am more interested in.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Atomic clock and atomic interferometer.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
I will introduce STROMCM.

04:20.000 --> 04:30.000
In principle, I will also introduce the so-called laser cooling STROMCM to Bose-SanSan condensate.

04:30.000 --> 04:40.000
Next, I will introduce our entire experimental setup.

04:40.000 --> 04:50.000
The three main results are, for example, Ultra High Phase Space Density MOD.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
And how do we achieve the principle of Steady State Unity Phase Space Density.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
Next, of course, I will introduce one of the cooling technologies we have developed, CISPOS Optical Lattice Decelerator.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Next, I will give Outlook.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
First of all, let me introduce myself.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
My master's thesis was originally done in Taiwan.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
My master's thesis experiment.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
In principle, my experiment is to achieve a full optical Rubidium Bose-SanSan condensate.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
It is also because of this factor that I am interested in laser cooling.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
So when I applied for a doctorate class,

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Because when I was a soldier, the English exam preparation was not going well.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
For example, I did not pass the TOEFL exam.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Then I thought I would come to Europe to do it.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
At that time, I read some papers when I was studying in the master's class.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
I know that there is a good team in Innsbruck, Australia.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
At that time, I thought I would try to apply.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Then I applied to Rudy Green's lab.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
At that time, the group I applied to was originally a strong team.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
But then my little boss,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
In principle, it is our actual boss, Florian.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
He later applied for a teaching position to move to Amsterdam.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So I will come to Amsterdam to do it.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
There is a very interesting historical source in Amsterdam.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
This person is called Joke Worven.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
In principle, at the beginning of BC,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
When you want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation,

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Ordinary people have not yet considered the elements of the EA group.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
They want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation in hydrogen.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Joke Worven, in principle, his lab in Amsterdam

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Is to do hydrogen cooling.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Then I want to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
So, in principle, we have some in Amsterdam.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
This kind of laser cooling historical source is right.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Of course, we moved from Australia to Amsterdam.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
It's also a toss.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
In principle, this is our good team in Amsterdam.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
First of all, let me introduce what Bose-Einstein condensation is.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
We all know that in principle, W1 material,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
In principle, you can have the nature of the wave,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
You can also have the nature of the particles.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Of course, it depends on your temperature conditions.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
To determine some of the characteristics of your wave field.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Of course, we know that under higher temperature conditions,

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
In principle, O-nitrogen behaves more like a particle.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
When the temperature drops,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
The relationship between W1 and O-nitrogen tells you that

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Its wavelength will gradually increase.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Then you start to use some fluctuations

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
To describe some of the behavior of your particles.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Of course, the closer you get to your condensation temperature,

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
The wavelength of your O-nitrogen starts to overlap.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Then you are more and more unable to tell the particles.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Finally, of course, in theory,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
When T equals zero, you will reach a so-called

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Bose-Einstein condensation state.

08:27.000 --> 08:38.000
The picture is basically tested by the MIT team in 1997.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
That is to say, they realized that

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Let two Bose-Einstein condensations interfere.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
In the experiment, of course, they first realized a Bose-Einstein condensation.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
They divided an O-nitrogen into two.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So in the end, two Bose-Einstein condensations were formed.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Then they let it interfere.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Then you will see a very obvious

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Interference of the particle wave.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
After BC was realized,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
First of all, it is a particle wave.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
If it is a particle wave,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
In the experiment, of course, they will think

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It's like a laser.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
They tried to achieve some

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Demonstration of particle laser.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
You can think of it as

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
In principle, it is an optical cavity.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
All the atoms are in a so-called cavity mode.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
You try to get this particle wave

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
After the particle wave comes out of the cavity,

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
In principle, they realized some of these particle lasers.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Of course, the current technology in the experiment

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
In principle, it can only achieve

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
There is no way to achieve a continuous particle laser.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
In principle, you want to achieve a continuous particle laser.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Of course, you need some

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
You have to achieve some first.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
First of all, you have to have a continuous BC.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
To achieve a continuous BC,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
You have to have some continuous cooling technology.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Continuous evaporative cooling

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Or some continuous trap loading

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
In principle, many people in the past 20 years

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
Try to realize it.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Of course, in the end, they still haven't achieved

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
The ultimate goal is a continuous particle laser.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
In principle, this is still a very difficult thing.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
The reason why it is so difficult is because

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
For example, the conditions for BC to be realized

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
In principle, we all look at this so-called optical cavity density.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You can think of it as

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
For the water in the fish tank

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Under low temperature conditions

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
It may have already thawed.

11:07.000 --> 11:14.000
In principle, in the process of cooling

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Its density conditions may already

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
There is no way to achieve the so-called

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
To achieve the state of BC condensation

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
First of all, we know that BC condensation

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
It has this optical cavity density

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
It has to reach the condition of greater than 2.6

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Its degree of freedom depends on the relationship with temperature.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
So we know that first of all, my density has to be high enough.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Then my temperature has to be low enough.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
But under conditions of high density

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Assuming that your density is too high

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
In principle, the atom will have a so-called

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Loss mechanism

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
In principle, it is a so-called three-body recombination.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
It will form molecules

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
In principle, it is a

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Do you understand?

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
In principle, it is a loss mechanism.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
We know that in principle

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
The density is almost on this scale.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
It is 10 to the 14th square

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
So it means that your density cannot be too high.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
If it is too high, your three-body recombination

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
In principle, your atoms will form molecules.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
So your density is almost controlled at 10 to the 14th square.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
That gives a contrast

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
In principle, in your air

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
In principle, your density is almost 10 to the 19th square.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
So you can say

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
In principle, we are doing cold matter

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
When the cold atom is studied

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
The density of the atom group we are talking about

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
In principle, it is thin

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It's 10 to the 14th square.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
It's 10 to the 14th square.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
To reach this Bc condition

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Its corresponding temperature is almost at this level.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
1μK to 10 nK level

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
This is a very cold principle.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
That is to say

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
That's why it's called an ultracold atom.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Because it compares with other temperature scales.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Our cold atom is almost in this range.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Compared with other Earth's room temperature conditions

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
300K here

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
We are at about 7 or 8 numbers

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
A temperature condition below

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
The current realization

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
In principle, it is because of the restriction of cooling technology.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
We can only achieve the so-called

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
The so-called Maltese-Boson condensation

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
You need to have the first stage of laser cooling in the experimental technology.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Then evaporate the cooling

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
When you reach Bc

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
You try to put the atom group inside

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
After the alcohol comes out

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Of course, you will later

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
After using up the atom group in the trap

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Then you have to do another experiment.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Re-create the Boson condensation

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
So on the experimental technology

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
You can only achieve the so-called Maltese-Boson condensation.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Of course, the continuous Boson condensation

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Or continuous material laser

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Has always been in the field

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
A goal that everyone wants to achieve

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
But even after 20 years of effort

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
There is still no way to achieve it.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Has not been achieved yet

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Of course, we use laser cooling in the experiment.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Then I will briefly explain

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
Some mechanisms of laser cooling

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
First of all, the atom

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
First, we know that the atom interacts with the light.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Take a look

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Sorry

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
First of all, the atom is electrically activated.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
There is a principle

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Resonant light

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
It absorbs a light corresponding to the quantum frequency.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
The atom will be activated

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Then there will be a transfer of momentum

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Of course, after releasing the light back to the atom

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
There will be a transfer of momentum

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
The principle of laser cooling is based on this mechanism

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
To interact with the atom through light

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
To do a deceleration action

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Of course on the experimental level

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Through this mechanism

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
We want to take the atom from

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
For example, this is our source

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
You throw a piece of metal into the oven

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Heat it up

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It will be vaporized

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Of course, vapor pressure corresponds to

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
For example, you heat it up

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
For example, on our experiment, we put it at 500 Kelvin.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
So it's basically

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Sorry, 500 degrees C

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Then it will have a corresponding 500 degrees C

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
The speed distribution of Boltzmann distribution

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
How to interact with the atom through light

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
To decelerate this speed distribution

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
In principle, on the experiment

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
We also use a so-called Zeeman Slower

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Zeeman Slower is mainly through

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Atomic under magnetic field conditions

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
It is a connection to the magnetic field

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Change

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
On the principle of our laser

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
In the picture, you see the principle

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
On the experiment, we will go around a circle

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Create a T-magnetic field

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
This T-magnetic field

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
It corresponds to

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
When my light and atom are in this position

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Corresponding magnetic field

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
It creates

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It meets the conditions

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
It interacts with the atom

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It has a momentum shift

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It decelerates

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
So the atom is decelerated

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Then in the next position

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Because my magnetic field has a T-magnetic field change

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm in the next position

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
My magnetic field conditions

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
To find a way to maintain this

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Light and atom interaction

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Under constant conditions

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
My atom group

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
After this Zeeman Slower

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
After a deceleration

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
In principle, in the back

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Can put my entire atom group

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Its speed distribution

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
That is to say, a deceleration action

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
The principle of this experiment is

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
The overall experimental structure

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
For example, I have an oven

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Is my heating

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Heat the metal block

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Area of ​​generating steam pressure

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
Then this is my Zeeman Slower

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Then finally

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
I want to be in this place

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Do a state of atom capture

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
This is just a general

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
A standard

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
A pulse-injection-like

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm just making an example now

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
Let's take a look

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
In the experiment, of course, we finally

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Is in

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Do an atom capture

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Let's take a look

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Sorry, don't jump

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
That just said

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
After the atom capture

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
The technology used in the atom capture

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
For example, the last area

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Will put the so-called six lasers

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Six lasers in space

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
In principle, you can put

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Atomic group in all directions

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Do a deceleration action

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Of course, in the experiment

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
We add a magnetic field

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
To be able to do a so-called

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Spatial confinement

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Then I'm here in principle

19:29.000 --> 19:50.000
Just skip it first

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
In the principle of laser cooling

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
In the next step

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It is necessary to enter the evaporation cooling

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
The reason is because

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
In the process of laser cooling

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Your laser cooling will have a so-called

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Laser cooling corresponds to a

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Cooling temperature limit

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
The cooling temperature limit

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Mainly you can understand it as

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
When all your atoms

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
After being cooled

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
It will get higher and higher

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
But because

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
You are absorbing the cooling light

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
The next step is to release the cooling light

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Release a spontaneous emission

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Then the light released

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Because the density of the atomic group is very high now

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
It may be further

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
It's a bit like heating the atoms around you

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
The reason is because the density is very high now

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
So it corresponds to a

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Laser cooling corresponds to a

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
Cooling temperature limit

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So in principle

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
At the end of the experiment

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
After this laser cooling step

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Will do an evaporation cooling action

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
The evaporation cooling action

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
General technology now

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Of course there is the so-called magnetic field

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Is to put the atomic group

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Put it in a magnetic track

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Or light

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
Did you use light in the experiment?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Let me explain a little bit

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
What is the overall mechanism of light?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
We all know that the atom

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
There will be one in the power plant

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Will be polarized

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Then this

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
It will have a spontaneous

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Electric dipole

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
In principle

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Suppose I use light today

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
To produce a so-called

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
AC electric field

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Then my atom in principle

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Will be

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Induced dipole moment

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
In principle, its power plant is produced by light

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Then he knows

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Because of this

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
In the light field

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Its dipole moment

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
In principle, it will

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Because of the power plant

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Sorry

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
For example, we are using light now

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
To produce a light field

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That light field because

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
In principle, the light field

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I produce this

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Trap his

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
It is determined by its intensity

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
That is to say, I assume

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Today light is a Gaussian beam

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
It has an intensity distribution

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
In principle

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
This dipole moment

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
To induce

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
In this light field

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
For this intensity distribution

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
You will have the so-called

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Assuming

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
The atom is in the light field

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Suppose I have this light today

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
For it

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
If I am a

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Redshift

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
It means

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I assume my wavelength

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Than the wavelength of the light I use

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
If the wavelength of my atomic quantum frequency

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
If it's still long

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
We call it

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
In principle, it is called

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
In this light

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
In principle

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
This light field is called

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Red Dipole Trap

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Red Dipole Trap

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
In principle, it is said

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
My atom will be concentrated

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
To a higher intensity

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Area

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Compared to

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
Assuming the wavelength of the light I use today

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
If the wavelength is still short

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
The overall

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
The characteristic of the light produced is that

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
My atom will be concentrated

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
The lower part of the intensity

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
That

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Just a little bit here

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Demonstrate

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Atomic group

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Some interactions with light

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
In the experiment, of course, we are

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
After generating the so-called magnetic light

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Open my Red Dipole Trap

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Then it is

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
In principle

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You will see

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
The atomic group is

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Leaked into the Red Dipole Trap

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
That

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
This is just to show that

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
After opening the Red Dipole Trap

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I go

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
That is

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Just open

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
0 ms

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
10 ms

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
20 ms

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
That my atomic group

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
One

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Atomic group

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Leaked into the Red Dipole Trap

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
One

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Behavior like this

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
In the experiment, of course, we reached

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
That is to say, the atomic group

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Leaked into the light

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Then we need to evaporate and cool in the light

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
That evaporate and cool

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
The concept is very simple

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
After the hot atom leaves

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Overall

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
The remaining atoms will go through again

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
One

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Thermalization process

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
At the end

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Of course, the overall temperature will drop

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
That

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Evaporate and cool

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Next

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Evaporate and cool

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
When the temperature is getting lower and lower

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
After reaching the critical temperature

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
You will see one

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Atomic group

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
The process of phase transformation

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
That

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Here

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Is a

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
At the end

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Evaporate and cool

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Then the radiation freezes

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
One

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
This is a whole

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
A phase transformation

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
One

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Demonstration

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
That

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
In

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Evaporate and cool

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
He

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
How do you judge

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Your substance has passed

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Is already

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Reached the evaporation and cooling state

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
That

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
In the experiment, we will

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Through

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Uh

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
For example, I am looking at this

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Atomic group behavior

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
That

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
For example, we are now

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Here is the

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Uh release

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Then the atomic group will be in the gravity field

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It will fall under the conditions

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
That

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Let's do an image action

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
That

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Atomic group

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
In principle, it assumes

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
If it is still thermal gas

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
He is in

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Uh

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
You will see that in principle it is a

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Isotropic expansion

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
One behavior

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
That

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Assuming he is today

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
If it reaches the evaporation and cooling state

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
That

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
In principle, you will see a

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
So-called

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Anisotropic

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Expansion behavior

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
That this is with

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
You can understand it

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
That is to say

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Uh

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
For example, if you have a

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Elongated

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Cloud

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
That in

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
He is in

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
After you release the

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
He is in the gravity field

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Falling

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
That

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
He was originally

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Strong

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Strong confinement

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
On the axis

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
His

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
He is stronger

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
So he will

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
In the process of release

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
In principle, it will grow faster

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
He will have

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
It also leads to

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
He will have this

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
So-called

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Anisotropic expansion

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
A phenomenon

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
That this is

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
In principle, our

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
A smoking gun

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
That is to say

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
As long as we have reached BC

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That in principle

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
We are going to

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Find this

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Anisotropic expansion

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
To determine that we have reached

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
The state of BC

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
That of course

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
1995

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
BC was realized for the first time

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
That

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Next

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
In 2001

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I got the Nobel Prize

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
That

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
So far

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Uh

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Someone

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Have a question

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Want to ask

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
That is to say

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm just a little bit

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Laser cooling

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
That

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
So far

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Someone has a question

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Hello

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Hello

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
I want to ask

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
That

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
You will be sure

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
It's you

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Inside this

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Or your BC

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
How many

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Or how many

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
For you

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Because

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Sometimes there will be

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
He is like

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
His number should be

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
It's all changing

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Uh

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Uh

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
So

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
I

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
I

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
I

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
I

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
I

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
I

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
I

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Uh

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Uh

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Uh

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Of course

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
We experiment

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
For example, you see this picture now

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
That we are

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Do

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Uh

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Assortment imaging

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
It's basically

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
To go back

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
How many of its atoms are there

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Like this

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
This picture

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Uh

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Uh

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Of course I can't guess now

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
But

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Almost

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Look at this condition

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
There are about 10 5-quarters

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
10 6-quarters

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
The number of atoms

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
On the experiment

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Of course we will

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Will calculate

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
But

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Uh

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
For example, we are now on the experiment

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I want to reach the continuous Bohr's law

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Can be imagined

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
At the beginning

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
The number you reach

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Not so much

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
It's possible

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
10 3-quarters

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
10 4-quarters

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
So

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
But he has a corresponding condition

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
That is to say

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Uh

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
The number

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Also with your

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
The temperature of the ring

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
It has something to do

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
That is to say

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You have to reach

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
So many

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Uh

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Bohr's law

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Your

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
You have a corresponding ring temperature

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
That's right

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
So

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
On our experiment

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Of course, we have to find a way

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Condition

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
That is to say

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
I want my system to be able to

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Cold to such a low temperature

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
That

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
At that temperature

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
How much density do I have to reach

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
To have a way

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
To cross that

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Condition of phase space density

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Greater than 2

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
That is

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Uh

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
N lambda 3-quarters

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Greater than 2.6

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
This condition

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
In principle

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
I'm going to adjust this

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Density

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
With temperature

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
That whole person

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
To have this

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Satisfy this condition

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
I have a way to

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
To reach the Bohr's law

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
So

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Uh

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I don't know if this answers your question

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Hey, it's okay

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
You go ahead

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
We

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I have some questions later

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
I'll ask you again

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
OK

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Technical questions

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I'll ask you again

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Hey, hello

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
That one

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
The one in the first video

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
It's gone

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
It's your head now

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Oh really

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Hey

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Do you see your desktop

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Or am I seeing yours now

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
OK

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
I see

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
It's okay to continue

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
OK

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Uh, I have a question

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Let me introduce us

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
That

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
OK

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Uh, sorry

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
I just want to ask

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
That is

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Uh

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
What is it called

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
That is

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
You want to produce

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
CW

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
The

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Bose Einstein Converter

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
That is

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
You can let that Bose Einstein Converter

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Keep going

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
So

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
My question is

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
That is

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Under what circumstances

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
That is

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Under what circumstances

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Why won't it last

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
OK

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
How long does it last

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
How long

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Let me find the video

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Uh

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
How long

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
In principle

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
On top of time

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Is

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
You mean

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
It has an infinite duration

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
What I just said

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
It has an infinite duration

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
It has an infinite duration

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
It has a time limit

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
It has a time limit

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
That time limit

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
That time limit

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yes yes

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Yes, that's right

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
That time limit

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
In principle

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
It depends on your experimental technology

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You have to go through the laser cooling first

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
And then the next step

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Evaporate and cool

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Finally reach the Boltzmann fission

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
That

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
But in principle

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Your entire system

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
You will have a

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Uh

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Loss

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Or you're doing atom

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Outcouple your atom

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Outcouple your atom from your BC

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
After your atom comes out

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
That you

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
In the end

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
You still use up all the atoms

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
So that means

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
You're in the experiment

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Re-create the Boltzmann fission

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
So that's because of this

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Restriction, so

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
In the experiment

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
You will

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
You

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Your Boltzmann fission

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Or your atom laser

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Is

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
There will be a

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Uh

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
It's a soldering

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Because you're going to run out of atoms

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
That experiment

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Is to achieve

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
That is to say

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Continuous

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
That is to say

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Your Boltzmann fission

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Continuous

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Boltzmann fission

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Continuous

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
That side

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
That is to say

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
He basically

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Assuming I

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
If I keep

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
What do you mean

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
If it's

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
That is

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
That usually we

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
The last step is

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Outcouple

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
That BEC

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Then you can measure

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Correct

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
That if

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
You keep outcoupling

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
That BEC

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Just

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
Won't it be there all the time

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Uh

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Is because

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
You have to know

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
In vacuum

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
He still has a so-called

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Background collision

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
He

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Your

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
You have a BEC

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
He's in

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Under vacuum

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
In your

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Inside the trap

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
He will still

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
There is a

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Background collision

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
A loss caused

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
In principle

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
You can imagine

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
His lifetime

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
In principle

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Under the best vacuum condition

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
In principle

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
It's about 30 seconds

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Uh

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
After 30 seconds

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Your atom

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
In principle

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
After a series of

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Background collision

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
In the end

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
It's gone

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
So

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
On the experiment

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
You have to start again

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Re-create

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
A wave

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Out of vacuum

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
So

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
OK

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Yes

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
There is a

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Background collision

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Result in

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
You have a whole

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
A loss

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Uh

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
OK

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Good to know

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
it is good

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Thank you

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
That

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
On the experiment

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
We are doing strong

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Strong

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
With

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Uh

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Different elements of the 2A group

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Of course, he has two

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Add electrons

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
That

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
It corresponds to the electronic connection

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Different from the 1A group

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
In

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
He has so-called

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Singlet

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
With triplet states

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
That

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
First of all, we all know

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
In the 1A group

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
You make these atomic keys

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
That is

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
In principle

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
He will meet

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Some so-called

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Selection rule

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
That

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
In the 2A group

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Because he has a triplet state

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
That

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Atomic keys from singlet to triplet state

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
In principle

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Not satisfied

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Selection rule

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
That is to say your

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Delta s

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Not equal to 0

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
In principle

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
This is

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Selection rule

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Not allowed

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
But of course

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Because

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Some

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Coincidence mechanism

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
For example

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
For example

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
In this 3P state

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
He

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
He and

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
This state

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
1P1

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
In principle, there is a coincidence

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
That

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
In principle

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
He will indirectly

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
With

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Ground state couple

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
To

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
So he

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Overall

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
This key

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
He

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Still allowed

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
That

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
But the answer he corresponds to is

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Because he

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Uh

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
He corresponds to the key

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Is allowed

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
But he corresponds to the width of the line

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Relatively narrow

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
That

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
This is

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
A level scheme of strong

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Then we see

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
For example

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
In

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
First left is

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Singlet state

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Right is triplet state

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
That

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Singlet state inside

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
This

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
This

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Is what we use

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Mainly laser cooling

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
He corresponds to the width of the line

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
In principle, it is

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
30.5 MHz

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
That

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Triplet state is our second stage

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Laser cooling key

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
That

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
His line is relatively narrow

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
That

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Because I just mentioned

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Is

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
He

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Selection rule

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
This is a

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Forbidden transition

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
But

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
He

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
In principle, it is

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
He corresponds to

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
In principle, he

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
In principle

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Not completely forbidden

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
So he corresponds to

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Is a

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Transition of the width of the line

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
He corresponds to the width of the line

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Transition

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
He is on the laser cooling

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Allow you to reach

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Lower

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Cooling limit

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
So

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Use this

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Uh

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
To do laser cooling

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
He can reach

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
A lower temperature

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
That

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
He has some

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Features

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
This

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Metastable state

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I will introduce later

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
I am

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
We use it

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
For example

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Uh

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
In general

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Poisson

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Poisson

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Inside

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
He can be used

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Accumulate my atomic group

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
That is to say this is a

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Lifetime

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Long

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
State

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
I can put the atom

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
In principle

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Concentrated in this state

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
To do

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Uh

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Accumulated action

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
That

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
His

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Ground state

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Mentioned here is that

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
No

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Magnetic

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Magnetic

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
No

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Electronic

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Magnetic Moment

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
So

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
My

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Atomic atom

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Originally in

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
I can't use

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Because he doesn't have

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Magnetic Moment

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
So I can't use

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Magnetic to capture him

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Also limited to say

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Is

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
I have to use light in the experiment

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Instead of magnetic

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
That

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
This is the reason

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
He doesn't have

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Magnetic

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Magnetic Moment

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
That

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Current stage

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Strong

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
The experiment

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
In principle

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Uh

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
I'm here

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
There are many principles

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
For example

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Ultra cold

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Inside the atom

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Want to

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
We have it in the lab

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
For example

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
We want to do

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Ground state

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
That

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
There is also a strong

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
Two molecules

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
And

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
For example

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Now

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Very

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Red

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
For example

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Quantum gas microscope

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Want to

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
In principle

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
We want to do

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
High resolution

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
That is to say

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
High resolution on the experiment

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
One

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Uh

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
To observe the atomic group

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
Some

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Uh

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Experiment

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Or say

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
For example

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Use magnetic atoms to do atomic interference

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
And

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
The next thing I'm going to introduce is

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Use magnetic atoms to do superradiant laser

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
That

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
There are many

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
That

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
I'm more interested in

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
For example

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Let's do the atomic group

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
That

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
We all know now

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Atomic group

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Now use color atoms

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
To do

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
That

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Uh

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Time definition

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
That

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
In fact, this is with color atoms

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Hyper

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Uh

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Ground state

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Hyperfine state

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
To do a

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Uh

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Time standard

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
That

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Color atoms

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Ground state

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Hyperfine state

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Transition

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Almost

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
In

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Uh

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Gigahertz level

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
It seems

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
There are

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
More than nine gigahertz

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
That

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Of course

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
We all know that

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Some of it

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Uh

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Then I'm on the right side

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
A list of

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Relationship

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
We know that this

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
His

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Accuracy

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
In principle

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Is with

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Screen

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
His uncertainty

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Is related to his frequency

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
That

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
From this relationship

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
We know that

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Your center frequency

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
For example

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Ccm

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
It corresponds to

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
The frequency is in the gigahertz level

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Of course they are on the time

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
I hope to put this frequency

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
The higher the higher the better

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Because

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
This way

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
This one

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
His

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
The error can be

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Or

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
His

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Uncertainty can be smaller

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Because you imagine

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
For example

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
I put

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
He from gigahertz

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Back to

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Terahertz

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
That

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
This one

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
The denominator is super big

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That he overall

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
I

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Error of hertz

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Corresponding to an uncertainty

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
His

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Fraction is smaller

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
That

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
In addition, we know that the number is in principle

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
The more atoms, the better

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
That's why the experiment

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
The glasses are in the light

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
This piece

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
They want to go from gigahertz

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
To

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Light to push

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Push to terahertz

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
That of course

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Uh, the first one

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Light

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
The candidate is, for example, ion trap

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Because ion, for example, ion

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
He has some

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Ion corresponds to

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Uh, for example, clock transition

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
That is to say, you can

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Uh

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
He corresponds to the clock transition

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Can be used as your time standard

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
But

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Uh

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Uh

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The first generation of ion trap, of course

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
He trapped an ion

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
So in this number

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
He is relatively

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Weak

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
That's why

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
In

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
The new generation, of course, other people have other proposals

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
For example, to do optical lattice clock

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Of course he is

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
The more traps, the better the atoms

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
That optical lattice clock

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
He also uses atoms

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Also use the atomic clock state

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
In terahertz level

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And then he has to trap a lot of atoms at the same time

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Go to this

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Pull up

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
That overall makes the whole

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Uh

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
The accuracy is higher

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
That

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So state of the art

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Of course it is

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
The night army in Gila

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
What he achieved now, of course, is

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
The Fermi gas clock

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Uh, Fermi gas clock

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
That of course

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
His this

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Now on the experiment

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Uh, the principle is

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Almost at 10 to 18

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
10 to 18

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Of course this is

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
This is listed here

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
The night army

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
He

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
In his speech, it is often mentioned that

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Assuming that he can achieve it in today's experiment

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
One

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Uh, Fermi gas principle is

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
There are 1 million atoms

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
That his

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Uh, he has a way to reach this

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Uh

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Accuracy in light

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
A value of 10 to 20

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
At the same time, of course

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
In Gila

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
They also have another one

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Uh, the approach on the experiment

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
For example, it is

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
James Thompson, his super radian laser

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
The principle is

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Uh

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Generally, we

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
In the experiment of the night army, he

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Atoms are his

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
His

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
A substance of detection, of course, is

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
To find a way

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
He also has to go through a local

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
For example, he wants to do a very good laser

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And then through this laser

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
His

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Made of atoms

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
So the atom as a whole

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
In his experiment, this is a

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Uh

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
He needs a very good clock laser

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And then to probe his

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Uh

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
What is it called

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Atoms are his

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Absorber

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Just

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Atoms are his

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
A substance of observation

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
So the overall

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Your light is a so-called passive

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Clock because you are

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
You have to use a very good

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Laser to observe your

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Sample

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
James Thompson's approach is basically different

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
He just wants to let the atoms

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Go by yourself

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Release the light of this clock transition

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
His experiment is

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Put the atom

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Put it in a cavity

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Then let him

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
A super radian effect

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
That's the last

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
The light you come out of

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
In principle

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Uh

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
It's determined by the atom

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Not by you

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Cavity conditions

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
To decide

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
So the experiment

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
He is now

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Make a

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Super radian laser

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
That

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Because this super radian laser

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
He is basically

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Clock state

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
3P0

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
His

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Uh

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Minihertz

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
They are now

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Super radian laser

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
That

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
They are the same

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Two experiments

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
To make a

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
To measure

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Super radian laser

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
How accurate it is

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
So

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
James Thompson put his

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Super radian laser

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Optical lattice clock

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
To make a

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Beat note

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
To measure

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Uh

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
His super radian laser

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Conditions

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Of course they are now

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
About 10 to 15

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
That

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
James Thompson

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
He also wants to do

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Super radian laser

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Super radian laser

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
On this number

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Push down three

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
That means

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Usually in this kind of light

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Uh light experiment

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
You have to measure his

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Uh you do the points

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
That is to say

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
You measure light

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
You

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Uh

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
In principle, the accuracy

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
The longer you measure

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Uh

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
The higher the accuracy is

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
In the light

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
In the experiment

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
If you do it in a row

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
You

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
In this super radian laser

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
You are one second

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
In principle, you can reach 10 to 18

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
One of the four

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Conditions

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
That means

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
James Thompson gave himself a metaphor

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
For example, you put this light

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
His super radian laser

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
You are

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Uh

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
In principle

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Assuming that the conditions of CW

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
You can reach this level

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
That is

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Of course another

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Uh

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
The application of double-sided tape is of course

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Used on atomic interference

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Then we all know that atomic interference

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Uh

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
It can be used to measure your acceleration

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
It can be used to measure the gravitational field

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
It can be used to measure

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Uh

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Your rotation

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
In principle, it has a very high accuracy

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
That

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
In the experiment, of course

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
His

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Sensitivity

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
With

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You in your

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
For example

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
You can

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
On the basis of the atomic group

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
You let him do

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
The longer the time

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Or your

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Your two atomic groups

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Just

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
The greater the distance

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Your sensitivity will be higher

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
So

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Now on the experiment, of course

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
They take this thing

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Want to do

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
For example

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Or

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Gravity wave detector

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
First of all, I must say

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
This is the atomic interference

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
One of them

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Quite interesting application

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
But I don't do this myself

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I can only say

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
On the basis of technology

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Tell you a little bit

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Now there are principles

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
In this regard

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
There are other teams doing

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
For example

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
On the gravity wave

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
On the detector

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Atomic interference

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
In principle, he has a way to make up

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Other gravity wave

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Detector

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
For example, now

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
There is a LIGO on the experiment

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
His detection wavelength is here

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
That next

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Proposed

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Lisa to sit in space

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
In principle, his detection wavelength is here

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
There is actually a gap in the middle

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
This gap can be in principle

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Atomic interference to make up

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
His advantage is

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
We all know gravity wave

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
He's going to measure this

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Chirping

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
When two

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
He finally

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
For example, your gravity wave

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Source, he finally

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
In the process

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Your measured gravity wave

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
In principle, the frequency will be higher and higher

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
But

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
You experiment

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
At this frequency

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
If you have a detector

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
His advantage is

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
You can

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
You are in a gravity wave

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Before the event

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
You can go through

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
For example, our atomic interference

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
After measuring the signal

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
He can go first

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Position in space

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Let you know

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
For example, your LIGO

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
You can expect

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
There will be a gravity wave

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
You can measure

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Of course

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Through this atomic interference

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Because he's in

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
The frequency he corresponds to

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
He

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Measured gravity wave

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
The lifetime of the event will be longer

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
For example, he is

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
0.01 hertz

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
To 10 hertz

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
So you basically

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
You can

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
He corresponds to

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
For example, you measure

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
The event

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
It takes a few months

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
He means

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
In the measurement process

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
In space

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
The source of your gravity wave

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
That

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Of course you can

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
With other

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
For example, LIGO

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Then

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
It's on some satellites

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
It seems to be measuring

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Electromagnetic wave

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Of

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
The principle

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
It means

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
You go to measure this gravity wave

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Of

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
You can match other

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Detector

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
So reach the so-called multi-messenger

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
One

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Measurement

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Of course you have to be able to do multi-messenger

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
It means

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
You have to know where he is

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Those detectors on the satellite

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
For

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Measure in that direction

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
So

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Atomic interference

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Can provide information

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Of

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Of course

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
At Stanford

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Do some

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Of

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
They first built a 10-meter

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Atomic interference

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
That

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Of course they also reached the so-called

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Of

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Of

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
The material wave

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Of

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Can reach 54 cm

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
That

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
That means

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
They also achieved some

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
On both sides

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Some early experiments in the gravity field

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
For example, in this experiment

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Their

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
In principle, your atomic group

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Is

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
He went to throw different heights

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
That he experimented

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
In principle, here is a

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
For example, an 80-kilogram

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Piece

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Then

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
They went to measure this

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Throw the atomic group at different heights

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
To scan this

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
In principle

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Gravity field

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
This result

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
In principle, it is a

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Demonstration that your

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
In principle, you can measure

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
A change in the gravity field

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Of course

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Of

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Their next experiment

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Of course, I want to scale up

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I want to do, for example, 100 meters

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Then

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
They want to do it with a private atom

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Because private atoms

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Some

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
In the past

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
For example, he first had a

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
That he experimented

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
He can reach

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Higher accuracy

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
So

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
This is a private atom

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
In the next few years

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
On gravity

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Detector

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
A

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Competitive application

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
That

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Then we experimented

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Then we do

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Our ultimate goal is to do

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Then

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
We have a way to produce

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
The so-called

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Continuous

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Assuming we have a way to produce

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Continuous Boson-Einstein connection

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Continuous

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
In fact, on the experiment

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
We also have

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Continuous

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
So this is

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Mainly in our

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Want to do

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Several plans

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
That

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I think I might be a little too slow

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
A little

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Speed up

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Then we experimented

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Just mentioned

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
To achieve continuous

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Laser cooling

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
That just said

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Laser cooling and evaporation cooling

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
On the experiment

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Not compatible

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
The reason is because

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Laser cooling has a laser cooling temperature limit

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
That next stage

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
You just want to put the atomic group

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
To

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
To the

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Put the atomic group to

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
For example, we use the

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Inside and then inside

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Evaporation cooling

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
At the same time you want to

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Turn off the laser cooling light

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
The reason is because the laser cooling is used

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Originally

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Resonant light

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
At the same time

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
In the cooling process

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Resonant

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
That is to say

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Resonant light

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
If there is a way

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
If there is a way to stimulate the atomic light

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
That

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Your atomic principle

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Is constantly heated

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
So in the evaporation cooling process

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
We must turn off the laser cooling light

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
That

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Of course

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
That is

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
You can't do it on the experiment

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
To achieve a so-called continuous

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
A

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Because these two cooling steps are incompatible

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
But

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
In 2013, our lab

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
The principle is

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Did an experiment

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
That

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
There is a way to achieve

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
That is to say we are completely

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
No evaporation cooling

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
We only rely on laser cooling

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
To achieve Boson-enzyme condensation

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
That

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Of course

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Here is the introduction

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
We put it on the experiment

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
That is the so-called transparency beam

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I just talked about the laser cooling

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
The source of the cooling limit

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Because

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
When the density is higher

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Your laser cooling light

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
In the process of re-release

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It will heat up your atom

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
That

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
In the experiment, we go through this

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
We call it transparency beam

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
We find a way to let the atom

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
To my laser cooling light

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
In principle

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Become transparent

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
That is to say, my atom can't see my laser cooling light

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
That

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Through this

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Transparency beam

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
A little trick

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Then we have a way to achieve

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Only by laser cooling

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
To achieve Boson-enzyme condensation

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
That

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Its mechanism is actually quite simple

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
That I am now

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
In principle

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
In the film

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
In my light well

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
That

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
At the same time

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I have my laser cooling light

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Is in this

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Um, use this

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Laser cooling light

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
That its laser cooling

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
The cooling limit is in principle

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Corresponding to

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Doppler temperature

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
In principle

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Doppler cooling temperature is about

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
180 nK

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Doppler temperature is about

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
About 500 nK

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
So

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Its laser cooling light corresponds to

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
The temperature limit is actually very low

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
So

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
My group of atoms in principle

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
In the light well

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Through laser cooling

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Can reach

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Almost

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
1 uC

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
That

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
That's why

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
To reach such a low temperature

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Mainly just mentioned

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Those

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Um

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Your

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Atoms will still have this

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Reabsorption of light

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Being heated

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
The state

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Of course, we use this

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Transparency beam

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Let me

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Excited state

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
This light is in principle

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Address my

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Excited state to another state

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
That

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
The reason for this light

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Because of this light

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
My excited state

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Its state is

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So-called

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
AC star shift

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
That

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Because of this light

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
My atom is in this

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Position

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Uh

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Excited state

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Light shift

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
So

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It can't

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
In principle

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
My light will not

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Interact with this atom

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
My light will not

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Interact with the group of atoms in this position

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
That

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Of course we are

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
My

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
The group of atoms is in my dipole trap

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Then

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Right

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
What you see is the distribution of the group of atoms in principle

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Let's say I open my

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Transparency beam

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I'm also doing

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Uh

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Imaging

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Because

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Sorry

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Let me say it again

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
This

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Absorption imaging

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Transition

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You can see the overall distribution of the group of atoms in principle

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
There is one in the middle

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
In principle, the density is higher

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Because I have this

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Dimple relationship

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Now I open my transparency beam

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Because

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
In this position

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Excited state

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Light shift

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
That is to say

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Shift

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So my

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
This beam of light

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
In principle, in this position

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
There is no way to interact with the atom

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So you are doing the same

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
When imaging

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Use this beam of light

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The group of atoms is in this position

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's with this

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
This beam of light is in principle

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
It's not fair

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So it's in principle

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
In principle, there is no way to interact with those atoms

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So you are in

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
You can't see it in the image

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Of course, the experiment

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Through this

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You can imagine

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
My laser cooling light

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
In

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Reservoir

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It continues to cool my laser

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
That

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
In

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Dimple

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Because of my

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Transparency beam

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Protect my atom

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So in principle, the atom

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Will not be these

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Light

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Do not interact with these lights

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
That experiment

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Laser light is constantly

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
In

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Reservoir

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Then

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
At the same time

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
In my dimple

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
If you don't interact with these lights

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
That my

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
In dimple

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The density is high enough

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The temperature is low enough

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
He has a way to form Boson

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That's why the experiment

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
On the right side of the picture

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
In principle

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
We hit it in the experiment

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Through

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Laser cooling

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
To achieve Boson

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That whole process

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
We did not do an evaporation

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Cooling

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
That

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
This experiment

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
When this experiment is completed

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Of course we want to go further

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
The so-called continuous

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Atomic laser

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Because now

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
To achieve Boson

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
We are completely free

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
We completely skipped the evaporation

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Cooling

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
That experiment

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
To achieve the so-called continuous

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Atomic laser

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
That

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Of course

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Just introduced

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
That is to say

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
On the experiment

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
My laser cooling evaporates

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
That experiment

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Of course

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I am evaporating

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
In the process of laser cooling

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I just ignored

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
That is to say

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
We do laser cooling on the experiment

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
There are two laser cooling stages

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
First of all

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
In principle, there is the first one

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
The so-called blue mark

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
That is to say, use this laser cooling light

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
To do the first stage of cooling

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Then

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Use this

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Thinner light

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
To reach a lower temperature

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
That

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Then

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
This Transparency Beam

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
In principle, it can protect my atom

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Let it

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Not interact with this laser light

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But on the experiment

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
We still need

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
The first stage of laser cooling

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
To accumulate my atomic number

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
To reach a lower temperature

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
To accumulate my atomic number

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
To reach enough atoms

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
To do the second stage of cooling

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
That is to say

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
There is a two-stage laser cooling

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Step

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And my

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Transparency Beam

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Only in the second stage

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
It works in the laser cooling process

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
But on the experiment

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
We still need the first stage

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Laser cooling light

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Next

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
We are going to do

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Continuous

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Uh

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Polaris

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Or continuous atomic laser

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
The second stage

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Uh

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Light we can pass

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
This Transparency Beam to protect my atom

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
But

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
The first stage of laser cooling light

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
We experiment

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
In principle, it is

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Let

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Uh

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
In another space

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Go to

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Finish my first stage of laser cooling

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Then the atom

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
In principle

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
To the second space

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
To achieve my so-called continuous

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Polaris

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Of course

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
This is our experiment

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Is

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
After the atom came out of the oven

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The first stage

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Uh

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
What we use is what we just said

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Uh

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Uh

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Do the first stage of laser cooling

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Next

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Then

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
In this chamber above

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This 30

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Megahertz

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
To do

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Uh

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Uh

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
After the atom came out of the oven

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
My atomic number is essentially

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
To

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The following chamber

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Go

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
To achieve my

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Continuous Polaris

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
That space

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
In this area

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
In principle, it is completely

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Uh

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
With my first stage of laser cooling

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
The space is separated

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
That experiment

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
In the middle of the chamber

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Of course there is also this

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Uh

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
In principle, it is to avoid some

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Scattering light

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Scattered blue photon

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Go to the following chamber

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
That

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
First of all

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
This is our general chamber design

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
We are

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Just do

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
All the first stage of laser cooling

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Achieve

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The atomic number is running

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
To the following chamber

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
That

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
In the following chamber, we are essentially

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
No blue light at all

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
We use the so-called

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Uh

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
To reach a lower temperature

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Of course

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
We want to have

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Uh

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
We first achieve

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
First make a

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
After that

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
The atomic number is essentially

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
In because this

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Is a 2D

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So it's on the axis

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
In principle, the atomic number can be

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Run up and run down

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The atomic number running down

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
We are

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
In principle

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Through a molasses

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
To cool

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Let the overall atomic number

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Uh

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Increase

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
That

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
At the same time we are

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It's a bit like

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Put two blue push pins

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
To

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Avoid the atomic number

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Run up

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You are

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
In

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
The following chamber

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Atomic number

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Relatively higher

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
That

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Uh

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
As I just said

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
But we have to achieve a series of

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
4BEC and

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
In the atomic laser chamber

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
We don't need blue light at all

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
That

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The red light used is essentially

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Corresponding to

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Uh

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
On the surface

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Because it is

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Only 7.4 kHz

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
The bandwidth

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Corresponding to

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
In principle, only

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
About

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
10

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
15

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Gravity acceleration

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
So it's actually a very

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Inefficient

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Speed reduction

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Of course we are

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
In principle

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Put this

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
7.4 kHz

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The bandwidth we want to do

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Frequency broadening

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
To make it overall

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Acceleration

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
That is to say

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
To have a way

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Uh

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
For example, I'm from the top

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Chamber

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
The atomic number it corresponds to is a

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
6 mps

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
A

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Speed limit

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
That

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Of course we have reached

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Uh

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
At least the first stage

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
In practice, we can't reach

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Steady state red mod

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
That steady state red mod is essentially

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
The first one in practice

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Through

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Continuous

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Use

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
7

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
7.4 kHz bandwidth

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
To achieve

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
A mod condition

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
That it

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
In principle

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
We have just reached

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Uh

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
First

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I just started talking about it

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
We have a way

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
In space

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
In different spaces with different

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Laser cooling

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
In this framework

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
In principle, it is realized

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Blue laser cooling on the top chamber

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Red laser cooling on the bottom chamber

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
A condition

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
That

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Of course

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
In practice

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
We put

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Mod center

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Pull

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Uh

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Side by side

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The main reason is because

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
If you make a mod here

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
He will still see

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Blue scatter light

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
So

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Through

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
My

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Mod center moved to the side

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
After

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Can reach a lower temperature

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
On the experiment

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
At the same time, of course

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I'm here

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
On this condition here, I reached one

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
On the experiment

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Continuous

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
One

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Atomic sample

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
On the experiment, I tried to

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Produce a pulse-like

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Scatter light connection

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Then use this

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Scatter light connection

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
To measure

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
My lifetime

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
The point is

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I have a BEC here

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Then I use this BEC

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Then at the same time I turn on my blue laser cooling light

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I'm going to measure my BEC lifetime

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Then through this step

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I'm going to make sure

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
In this experiment

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I'm here

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
He won't be

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
This place

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Laser cooling light

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
That

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
We're going to measure his lifetime

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Almost unchanged

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
So

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So in this experiment

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
We're sure

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
My experiment

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
My

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
The origin of this place

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Will not be above me

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Blue laser

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Cooling photon

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Then we try to

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Characterize my

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
A condition

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Then we found out that

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
The mass produced here

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Its space density

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
With all the previous

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Experiment to compare

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
We have a principle

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
100 times

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That is, we compare

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
All the previous

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Steady state

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Compared to the conditions

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Our mass

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
At least 100 times

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
The increase in the number of space density

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
This is our principle

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
The first piece of paper

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Junjia

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Hello

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I'm sorry because it's a little over time

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
You probably still

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
How long are you going to talk about

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Because we usually talk about an hour

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Yeah

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Take a look

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
So if you feel

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I think everyone is by the way

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
There's something wrong with you

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
To a stage

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
If you think it's a paragraph

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
That's it for today

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Let everyone come

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Please ask questions about your content

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Like this

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Okay

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I'll talk about it for another ten minutes

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
In principle

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Because in the first experiment

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
We reach the principle

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
100 times

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The increase in the number of space density

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
But

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
We still can't do it in time

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
The wave is very condensed

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Then we have the second experiment

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
In principle

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Is

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
In principle

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
In principle

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
In principle, we have a red mark here

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Then we

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Put the red mark

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Continuously exposed to our DiploTrap

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Inside

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
My principle

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Is that you can run through

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
On the right

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
A DiploTrap

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
One condition

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Then

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
He also continues to use

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
After these tricks

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
We have a way

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
A continuous

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
A loading

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Then finally

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
In this place

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
This is my

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I want to produce my one here

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
SteadyStateBEC

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
In SteadyStateBEC

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
In principle

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
We have to use this isotope

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
To realize

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
In principle

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
To reach

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
In principle

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
We have now reached

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
The condition

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
That is far from our goal

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
In principle

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
We are now in the same number

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
So

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Of course we are now

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
The next step is to hope

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Of course

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
We now have a new way to cool

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Because

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
In terms of here

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I have a Zeeman SlowerBeam here

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Is our one deceleration mechanism

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Then we found that this deceleration mechanism

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
In principle

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
It will heat up again in the experiment

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
The source here

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
We have

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Develop a new deceleration method

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
In the new experiment

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
In principle, we are going to use this new deceleration method

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I hope I can go further

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Try to put this

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
The density of the phase space

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Increase

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
In the end, of course, I hope I can reach

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Continuous BC

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I think I may have talked too long

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
In principle, this is our current state

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
In principle, this is our current state

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
So

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
To do a brief summary

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
In principle

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
In our new experiment

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
We hope to reach

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
In space

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Separate these two different cooling

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Laser cooling

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Step

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
In the experiment

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
We have a new experiment

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
We built a new experiment

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
That reached the first stage

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
High Phase Space Density

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
A condition

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And then try to realize

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Continuous

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
In principle

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
DipoleTrapLoading

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And finally reach a

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Space density

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
A state

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I just talked about

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
In this part

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Deceleration mechanism

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
We found

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
There is a heating effect on our atomic group

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
So we

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Try to develop new

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
That is to say different

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Deceleration mechanism

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
In the new experiment

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Hope to try to break through this

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
The density of the phase space is now

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
A bottleneck

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Once

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
In principle, we have a way

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Achieve continuous

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Deceleration

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
That's about it

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Hello

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Power

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Power

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Hello

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Did you hear

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Hello

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Hello

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Ok

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Thank you for the speech

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
That

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Now

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Is there anything about the speech?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
No problem

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Welcome to open questions

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
How many people are there now?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Just

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
There are about nine in the peak period

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I think

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
It's a bit too hard

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
to talk about it later

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Then

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I think

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Everyone wants to hear

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
There are some applications

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
in the middle

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Like you said, like gravity

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
That

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Or other things

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
What are the conditions

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
that need to be met

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
You say you are close to them

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Almost the same number

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
How long do you expect

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Will be completed

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Or within two or three years

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Is it like this?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
In principle, our experiment now

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Of course it is

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Put

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
New

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Speed ​​limit

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Applied to the experiment

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
That

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
In principle, I will do it again

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Then this time

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
My speed limit

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Instead of using

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Radiation pressure force

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
I will use it now

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
My new speed limit

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
That

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Briefly introduce

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
My new speed limit

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
In principle

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Is me

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
In principle

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Let the atom go

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I am on my excited state

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
To produce a

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Potential landscape

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Then once my atom is

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
After being stimulated

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Its energy

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Is through this excited state

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Potential landscape

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
It's climbing this

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
On the excited state

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
A process

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
To take the energy

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So this is

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
In principle, it is my new speed limit

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
That experiment

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I hope I can avoid this

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Speed ​​limit

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
To heat up

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
My atomic group

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
But at the same time

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
It won't

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
To affect

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Atomic group

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
A temperature

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
So the new experimental principle is

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I hope to prove this as soon as possible

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
That is to say

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
My new speed limit

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
It won't affect me

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Final

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
This is in

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Atomic group inside

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Then because it won't heat it

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
So hope

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Also in density

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Temperature conditions

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Under the conditions

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
To achieve my continuous

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Potential landscape

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
At least two more experiments

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
About two months

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
That hope

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
In principle

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Almost tested

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
That

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Is to be able to

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Try to answer this question

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Under the new speed limit

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I have no way to achieve my

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Continuous potential landscape

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Thank you

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Hey, can I ask another question?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Is a little

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
More

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
General

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
That is

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Why did you choose

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Is this strong?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And you just mentioned

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Use his

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Red number

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
That

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Red number

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
The use of

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
The same number of conditions

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Is

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Here

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
There are different numbers

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
For example, strong

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
That

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
You have to reach bc

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
You

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Your

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
He has one

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
At least

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
This

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Decide

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
There is no way

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Uh

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Go

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Do effective

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Thermalization

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Because you have to do

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Your

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
To do a heat balance

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Condition

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
That

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Because his

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Very low

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
So he

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Can't see each other

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
So

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Your cooling process

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
You don't have a so-called

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Heat balance

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So when you're cooling

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
He's hard

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Uh, the first one

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
It's hard to go

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
The second one is

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So low

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
And it's almost negative

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
In fact, there's no way

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Uh, stable

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
So in practice

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Even this

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
His

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Very high

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
But because of this

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
He's not a

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Easy to reach bc

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
The same number

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
So that

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
That's too high

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
So he's easy

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Once he's

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
He's

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
He's too high

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
He

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
In principle, the heat balance is too fast

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And then

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
It can even cause heating

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
He just happened to be

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
A very friendly

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
That

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
So in practice, we're going to

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
84

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
84

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Want to achieve

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
That

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Uh, why

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
The main reason is also

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Mainly because

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Um

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
He

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
The first stage

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Laser cooling

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
So I can do very effective

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Laser cooling to

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Fast

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Uh

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Accumulate atoms

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Because he has his second stage

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Laser cooling

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
First

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Width

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
It won't be too narrow

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
So I can still use it to do some

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Uh, uh

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
The first one is wide enough

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
So I can do laser cooling to very low temperature

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
That

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Can reach very low temperature

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
That

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Because of that 2013

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
We

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Laser cooling to bc

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It's a mechanism of transparency

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Go

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
To achieve the so-called full light

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Laser cooling

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Uh

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Boomerang

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Completely skipped

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
The step of evaporation and cooling

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
So that experiment

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
The double line becomes

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
The most likely

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Achieve continuous

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Boomerang

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
A element

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
So in principle

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So we will choose private atoms

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Mainly because of our experiment

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Is

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Start with private atoms

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
So

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
This

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
There is a reason to choose him

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Ah

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Is it

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
The 2A group

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
All can

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Up and down

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Everyone uses private atoms

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
That

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Is there a heavier one?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Also

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
If you can't reach it

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Change to a unified group

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
You can do it

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Or maybe

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
There is no way

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
A lot of people doing AMO

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Looking at the laser

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Can you get used to it?

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Or can you buy it?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Your question is

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
First in the second step

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Try to answer

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Laser cooling to bc

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
You have to find a way to make your atoms

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
A transparent mechanism

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
In this experiment

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Is through a

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
In our transparency

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
To let the atom

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
For this light

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Be transparent

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
But in space

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
We have to find a way

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
To put the atom

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
From the oven stage

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Cool to have a way

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Uh, there are two

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
The steps of laser cooling

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Assuming

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
If you use other 2A elements

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Cover the atom

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
His

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Transition

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Its bandwidth is 350Hz

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
That he actually

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Doing this

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Atom

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
If you use the atom

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Your

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Transfer

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Difficult to achieve

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
That is to say

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
If you want to do this

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Transfer

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Difficult

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
7.4kHz

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
It corresponds to

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
15

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
15

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
If you use the atom

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
350kHz

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
350Hz

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Almost

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Not too scattered

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
That means you're hard

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Efficient deceleration

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
You almost can't

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
For

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
You cover the atom again

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It's hard to decelerate

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
That is to say

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Somehow

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
In a sweet spot

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Hello

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Hello

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Other questions

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Hello

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Hello

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Other people

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
If you don't have any questions, you can ask now

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Otherwise, our speech will end today

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Please turn on the mic

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Let's give a round of applause to Junjia

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Okay, only me left

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Sorry

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Because I asked some small details

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I'm afraid everyone is getting impatient

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Thank you

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Junjia, next time we'll discuss other questions with you

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Okay

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Okay, thank you

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Junjia, go to sleep

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's a bit late, it's 3pm

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Okay

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Good night

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
