00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taiwan Radar Talk.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,920
I am today's host, Shi-An Hong.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,200
I am currently a post-doctoral student at the University of Michigan.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
Today's speaker is Dr. Hwang Chung-Ren.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,400
He is currently a post-doctoral student at the University of Tokyo, Japan,

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,960
and the Japan Research Institute for Human Materials and Materials.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,840
His research focuses on the application of crystalline materials and their structural characteristics.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,480
This is his main interest.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,320
It seems like you are about to get your Ph.D.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Yes, I am a bit busy recently.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,680
Today's topic is the metallurgy of quasicrystals.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,400
So let's welcome Dr. Chung-Ren to give us a speech.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:05,680
Before we start, please remember to turn on your microphones so that the speaker can hear you.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,280
So let's give him a round of applause and let the speaker begin.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Please remember to turn on your microphones.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
If we have any questions, can we interrupt you, Dr. Chung-Ren?

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
Sure, no problem.

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
I didn't prepare a good presentation today, so there might be some points that are not clear.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
You are welcome to interrupt.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,760
Okay, let's give Dr. Chung-Ren the microphone.

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,400
Okay, first of all, thank you for the introduction.

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
We have known each other for about a year, right?

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I think so. I've been a bit lazy lately.

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,400
So what I'm going to talk about today is the metallurgy of quasicrystals.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:08,400
As you all know, in 2011, Dr. Dan Shepman discovered that he had won the Nobel Prize for violating the principles of traditional quasicrystals.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:16,400
So today I'm going to focus on the difference between quasicrystals and ordinary crystals.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
And why they are called the third state of solid matter.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
First of all, this is the first picture.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
As you can see, it's actually not a flower.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:34,400
When Dr. Dan Shepman discovered quasicrystals, he was in a quickly solidified aluminum alloy.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
But this thing was actually a big challenge at the time.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Because this thing is not a stable quasicrystal.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,400
So this flower is what happens when it produces quasicrystals.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
At a low temperature, it will suck out a second phase.

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,400
At that time, Linus Pauling also challenged Dr. Dan Shepman because of this.

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,400
He said that there is no quasicrystals in this world, only Poseidon.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
So you can see that this is actually the original picture.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
This is a picture taken by a general SEM.

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
And then it became like this after mapping.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
The reason why quasicrystals attract me so much is because it is really beautiful.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,400
As I just said, when Dan Shepman discovered quasicrystals, he was actually an Italian.

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,400
He found that quasicrystals were actually discovered when he was doing sabbatical at NIST.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
In fact, he was very excited when he found this thing.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Why does this kind of quasicrystals appear symmetrically?

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
You can see this picture below.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Someone used the aluminum-palladium-manganese alloy to make a STM picture of potential energy.

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
We can see that it is really beautiful.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
And then you can see this pentagonal thing everywhere.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
This is when Dan Shepman was analyzing the structure of quasicrystals.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,400
He is a very famous thermo-mechanical master at NIST Sabbatical and John Kahn.

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,400
But in fact, why can quasicrystals win the Nobel Prize?

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
I really want to commemorate my boss.

53
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Unfortunately, he did not participate in our quasicrystals seminar this year because he was not in good health.

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
He died instantly when he was on a business trip to Taiwan.

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Mr. Kahn's two most important contributions to quasicrystals were that he synthesized a thermo-mechanical stable quasicrystals in 1987.

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,400
The synthesis of this thing led to the continued development of quasicrystals that have been around for more than 30 years.

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,400
His second most important contribution was that he successfully produced a two-dimensional crystallography in 2000.

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
What is so special about this two-dimensional crystallography?

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
It can replace a lot of atoms in real space.

60
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
This allows them to better observe the structure of the crystallography and make a more detailed real-space analysis.

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,400
We actually have a workshop in Japan for quasicrystals.

62
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Everyone calls Mr. Kahn a god's hand.

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Because many stable quasicrystals have been synthesized by Mr. Kahn according to the rules of his doctoral class.

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Mr. Kahn's most important contribution was that he successfully analyzed 12 kinds of quasicrystals related to the 5-axis 20-dimensional system when he was an assistant professor in Northeast Asia.

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,400
This is my outline today. I will briefly introduce what quasicrystals are and what quasicrystals are.

66
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,400
How are quasicrystals discovered? Why are they quasicrystals? How do we define quasicrystals?

67
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Why can quasicrystals be stable? I will also briefly introduce the nature and current development of quasicrystals.

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I hope that today's speech will allow more people to join the research field of quasicrystals.

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I think it's beautiful, but many people may find it useless.

70
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
First, let's talk about quasicrystals.

71
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Actually, I want to skip this part.

72
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Because I think everyone should have a basic common sense that quasicrystals must comply with Bragg's Law in quantum mechanics.

73
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,400
But when we look at the electromagnetic microscope, there are two electromagnetic microscopes here.

74
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm so bad at talking like this.

75
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Anyway, in the case of 200kV, the lambda is very, very small.

76
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Then we can see...

77
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Oh, it's broken.

78
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Then we usually have an input wave here when we are radiating.

79
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,400
It can be an electromagnetic wave, an X-ray, a medium-wave, a sum-house, anything.

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,400
When we are radiating, it must be in line with the number of lambda.

81
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,400
This is a very basic high school physics.

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,400
But when we are radiating with an electromagnetic microscope, the input angle is very, very small.

83
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
And at this time, it will produce a sphere.

84
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Because the radius of this sphere is very, very large, it can be regarded as a plane.

85
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
So we can project its wave onto a plane.

86
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:37,400
When its lambda value is less than d, sinθ can be close to c.

87
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,400
This is the low value when we are at the bottom.

88
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
This is a wave length of electromagnetic when we are at 200kV.

89
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:56,400
This sinθ angle can be regarded as a distance from this origin to any location.

90
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,400
According to this relationship, we call this thing the Euclidean space.

91
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Why is it called the Euclidean space?

92
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
It is a completely opposite space.

93
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,400
If the radius of these two planes is d, there will be a d star here.

94
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,400
If we define this position, this big d is equal to 2π.

95
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
There is a big d star here, which is in this position.

96
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,400
It's obviously longer, but it's a little bit farther away.

97
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
That's about it.

98
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Next is the difference between crystal and non-crystal.

99
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,400
This should be the non-crystalline matter at the beginning of the definition.

100
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
The crystal is obvious.

101
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,400
When we know its position, it has some very standard surfaces.

102
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
But in the crystal, we see that it is completely messy.

103
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
It may have an average spread.

104
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
When we sum up the definition of Bragg,

105
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
we can get a crystal with a very obvious spot.

106
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
We call it the color spot.

107
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
But in the case of amorphous,

108
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
in the case of non-crystalline,

109
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,400
it may show some ring-shaped spots.

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Next is,

111
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
if we list different atoms,

112
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
what should it look like in the Euclidean space?

113
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
We see that no matter where it is cut,

114
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
its position is the same width.

115
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
When we surround it,

116
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,400
we may find that the arrangement of the crystal

117
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,400
is very similar to that of the electron-surrounding group.

118
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
But here,

119
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
the above picture is a square.

120
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
You may not see any difference here.

121
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
It's all very obvious,

122
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
almost the same geometric shape.

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
But at the bottom,

124
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
you will see that

125
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,400
this is the arrangement of the crystal.

126
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Here, it's a hexagonal arrangement like this.

127
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
But here, it turns 90 degrees.

128
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
This is related to how to build a Euclidean space.

129
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I don't want to talk about it today.

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
The most important thing is to talk about

131
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,400
the periodicity of the arrangement of atoms.

132
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
We can find a unit

133
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
that can exist at the same time

134
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,400
in its electron-surrounding group.

135
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
If we want to meet this condition,

136
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
there are two more important features.

137
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I forgot this thing.

138
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Anyway, we will find the same geometric shape

139
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,400
in the Euclidean space as in the Euclidean space.

140
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
In the crystal,

141
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
when we know an atom,

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
as I just mentioned,

143
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
when we know where an atom is,

144
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
we can infinitely deduce

145
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
where the atom exists.

146
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Because the periodicity of each place is the same.

147
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I drew a line.

148
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I can continue to extend it.

149
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Of course, these constraints

150
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
and geometric shapes are imagined

151
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
to make it easier for us to identify some things.

152
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Then it will slowly extend, extend, extend, extend.

153
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
In other words,

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
knowing a place,

155
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
we can know all the places.

156
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
We can describe

157
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
all the positions in the actual space.

158
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
The second is

159
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
that if we only use one unit

160
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
to fill it,

161
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
like this place is square,

162
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
it must meet this.

163
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
I turned 90 degrees,

164
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
turned 90 degrees,

165
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
turned 90 degrees,

166
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
it's still the same.

167
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
It may not be so clear here,

168
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
so I open another one.

169
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Can you see it?

170
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
OK? OK.

171
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Suppose we turn now

172
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
to this triple axis.

173
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
This is a cubic structure.

174
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
This is a cubic structure.

175
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
This is a L1-2 face structure.

176
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Then we turn it to the triple axis.

177
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
We find that the light color is at the bottom,

178
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
and the dark color is at the top.

179
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Can you tell?

180
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
This color is yellow.

181
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
No, light blue.

182
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Lighter.

183
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Then we follow it at this time.

184
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
This should be the triple axis.

185
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
So when we turn 60 degrees,

186
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
we will find

187
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
pay attention to this position.

188
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
It will be light, dark, light, dark, light.

189
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
When we turn 120 degrees,

190
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
it will be the same color moving.

191
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
This is a symmetrical relationship.

192
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
It's the same when we turn to the double axis.

193
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
If we turn to the double axis,

194
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
we use 120 degrees to turn it.

195
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
It's a mess.

196
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Use 90 degrees to turn it.

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
It will run back and forth.

198
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
This is a state

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
that we have to find that it meets

200
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
the whole symmetrical axis.

201
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
So if we can only use

202
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
one shape to arrange,

203
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
we can see

204
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
that if we only consider

205
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
each unit is square,

206
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
or we consider a rectangle,

207
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
or we consider a rectangle,

208
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
these things can be arranged

209
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
into quadruple and quadruple.

210
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
If we consider a triangle,

211
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
you will find that

212
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
we can easily use one shape

213
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
or a hexagon like this,

214
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
we can fill the whole surface.

215
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
What about octagon?

216
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Octagon is very similar to quadruple.

217
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I forgot to draw here today.

218
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
If we try to connect here,

219
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
if we try to connect here,

220
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
this position,

221
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
this position,

222
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
this position,

223
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
this position,

224
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
when the line comes out,

225
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
the line comes out,

226
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
its point is different.

227
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Its point is different.

228
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
It doesn't meet the so-called

229
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
symmetrical axis.

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
What about pentagon?

231
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
When the pentagon comes out,

232
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
it can't be arranged

233
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,400
with a single shape.

234
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
If you are sensitive to shape,

235
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
you may find that

236
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
in this place,

237
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
the so-called naked places,

238
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
we can actually

239
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
split it into other shapes

240
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
to describe it.

241
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I will continue to talk about it later.

242
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
That is to say,

243
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
in traditional polygons,

244
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
in various different polygons,

245
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
it seems to have many possibilities,

246
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
but in fact,

247
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
in addition to the general

248
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
two-axis, three-axis, four-axis, six-axis,

249
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
we can't just use one unit

250
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
to fill the whole plane.

251
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
So the so-called 5, 8, 10, 12

252
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
seems to be symmetrical,

253
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
but in fact,

254
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
it does not meet

255
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
the conventional theorem of

256
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
traditional algebra.

257
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
So,

258
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
to sum up,

259
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
according to the theory of the line of the pentagon,

260
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
the so-called conventional pentagon

261
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
must have one-dimensional symmetry.

262
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
That is,

263
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
we know the position of an element,

264
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
we can easily use

265
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
a multiplication method

266
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
to describe the position of all elements.

267
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
That is to say,

268
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
if its D space is 1,

269
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I may be 1D, 2D,

270
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
3D, 4D, 5D, 6D,

271
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
and so on,

272
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
to find the corresponding element.

273
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
What is the second one?

274
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
It only accepts

275
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,400
the rotation operation of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 layers.

276
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Okay,

277
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
then we come to

278
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
the concatenation.

279
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
In fact, the concatenation

280
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
was not proposed

281
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
by Dan Shetman

282
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
at the beginning.

283
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
The concatenation word

284
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
is just a

285
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
long and interesting thing.

286
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
However,

287
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
he just said

288
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
why there is a

289
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
completely

290
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
against

291
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
the concatenation of a

292
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
symmetrical existence.

293
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
As I just mentioned,

294
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
if we can

295
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
find a

296
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
congruent graph

297
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
in the

298
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
electromagnetic graph,

299
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
then we can

300
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
connect in the actual space

301
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
to find a

302
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
arrangement

303
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
with the same

304
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
geometry.

305
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
But this thing

306
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
doesn't seem to be able to

307
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
completely fill

308
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
the whole plane.

309
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
So isn't it

310
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
congruent?

311
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
But as we just mentioned,

312
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
if

313
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
the color spots are shown,

314
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
when these color spots are shown,

315
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
it seems to have to be congruent.

316
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
So what the hell happened?

317
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Okay,

318
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
this is a

319
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
electromagnetic graph

320
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
made by Dan Shetman.

321
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
We use

322
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
a very traditional

323
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
algebraic way

324
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
to make it

325
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
according to its rotation angle

326
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
to find all of its

327
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
symmetrical

328
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
directions.

329
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
And finally,

330
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
it's possible that

331
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
this is

332
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
a form of

333
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
icosahedron.

334
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
This thing

335
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
has six pentagons,

336
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
ten triangles,

337
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
and fifteen

338
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
quadrangles.

339
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
The position of the quadrangles

340
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
is in this position.

341
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
We can see

342
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
the zero position.

343
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
The triangle is

344
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
obviously the

345
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
position of this triangle.

346
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
This is the position

347
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
corresponding to

348
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
this triangle.

349
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
The pentagon is

350
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
the vertical

351
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
from this point.

352
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Here are five

353
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
triangles

354
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
combined into this position.

355
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Okay,

356
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
this thing is

357
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
very interesting.

358
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
So,

359
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
in fact,

360
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
in 1976,

361
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Penrose,

362
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
a very famous

363
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
teacher,

364
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
was thinking

365
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
how to use

366
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
the smallest set

367
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
to lay out

368
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
all the plane

369
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
or how we

370
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
can arrange

371
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
all the polynomials

372
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
into a plane.

373
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
This is

374
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
one of the

375
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
patterns of

376
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Penrose.

377
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
In fact,

378
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Penrose patterns

379
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
have many

380
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
different forms.

381
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Finally,

382
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
this thing

383
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
is the most

384
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
similar to

385
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
quadrangles.

386
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
McKay

387
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
also contributed

388
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
to quadrangles

389
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
very well.

390
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
He was doing this

391
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
at the beginning.

392
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
This is using

393
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Fourier transform

394
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
to transform

395
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
from

396
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
one of

397
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Penrose patterns

398
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
to another.

399
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
If we go back

400
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
and see,

401
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
it's a little bit

402
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
similar to this pattern.

403
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
In fact,

404
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
they knew each other

405
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
at that time.

406
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
But

407
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
they didn't know

408
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
each other.

409
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
So,

410
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
no one could

411
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
use a reasonable

412
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
mathematical model

413
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
to describe

414
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
what exactly

415
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Penrose's

416
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
tiling looks like.

417
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Is this

418
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
the way

419
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
to arrange the atoms?

420
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Then,

421
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
later,

422
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
at that time,

423
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Paul Steinhardt

424
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
was

425
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
actually

426
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
he kept

427
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
claiming that

428
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
he thought

429
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
it was the tiling he found.

430
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
In fact,

431
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
the term tiling

432
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
was also defined by him.

433
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
At that time,

434
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
he was also inspired

435
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
by Penrose patterns.

436
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
There has always been a theory.

437
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
But

438
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
until 1984,

439
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
there was no

440
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
material coming out,

441
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
so he didn't publish it.

442
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
In fact,

443
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
when he published

444
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
this article,

445
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
it was only a little bit

446
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
later than

447
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Dan Shatman.

448
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
As soon as he published it,

449
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
he sorted out

450
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
this article

451
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
and threw it out.

452
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Pay attention to

453
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
the pattern

454
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
of this pattern

455
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
in this article.

456
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
This is from Dan Shatman.

457
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
This is from Dan Shatman.

458
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
This is a pattern

459
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
in the fast-acting

460
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
aluminum alloy

461
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
in Dan Shatman's

462
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
article.

463
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
This is very similar.

464
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Later,

465
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Steinhardt

466
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
did not publish

467
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
this article

468
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
because

469
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
he thought

470
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
it was the tiling

471
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
he found.

472
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
This is

473
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
the pattern

474
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
in the

475
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
fast-acting

476
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
aluminum alloy.

477
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
The pattern

478
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
is very similar

479
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
to the pattern

480
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
in the

481
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
fast-acting

482
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
aluminum alloy.

483
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Dan Shatman

484
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
did several

485
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
experiments on this

486
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
and tried to observe

487
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
these things.

488
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
He did a very

489
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
beautiful paper

490
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
on the mathematical

491
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
model and

492
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
this thing.

493
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
From the theoretical

494
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
calculation

495
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
to the actual

496
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
arrangement,

497
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
he did

498
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
everything

499
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
he could

500
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
in the

501
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
experiment.

502
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
But

503
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
at that time,

504
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
there was no way

505
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
to see

506
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
where the

507
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
original value

508
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
was.

509
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
So at that time,

510
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
most people

511
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
used the

512
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
mathematical model

513
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
to see

514
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
what the

515
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
actual situation

516
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
was.

517
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
But this article

518
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
is really

519
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
beautiful.

520
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
If you are

521
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
interested in

522
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
this kind of

523
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
calculation,

524
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
you can

525
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
take a look.

526
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
But

527
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
before that,

528
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
although

529
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
many people

530
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
made very

531
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
difficult

532
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
calculations

533
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
and

534
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
very good

535
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
electromagnetic

536
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
graph,

537
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
many people

538
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
did not

539
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
believe in

540
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
this thing.

541
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Why?

542
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Because

543
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
people thought

544
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
they could

545
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
not see

546
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
the real

547
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
thing.

548
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Because

549
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
at that time,

550
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
it was

551
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
only possible

552
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
to make

553
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
this kind

554
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
of crystal

555
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
structure

556
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
in a

557
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
fast

558
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
way.

559
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Like

560
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
you can

561
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
rotate 36 degrees

562
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
to form

563
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
a small

564
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
group

565
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
and then

566
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
it becomes

567
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
a state

568
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
that is

569
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
symmetrical.

570
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Can you

571
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
see

572
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
that

573
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
one

574
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
on my

575
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
side?

576
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Can you see

577
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
it?

578
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Can you

579
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
see

580
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
it?

581
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Can you

582
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
see

583
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
it?

584
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Can you

585
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
see

586
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
it?

587
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Can you

588
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
see

589
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
it?

590
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Let me

591
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
mate it.

592
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I don't think it's too clear.

593
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Let's see.

594
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Mating.

595
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Mating.

596
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Lag.

597
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
You see

598
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
it.

599
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Ah!

600
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
This is

601
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
if we look

602
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
at this place

603
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
.

604
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
This is

605
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
this is a direction

606
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
of the pentagon.

607
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
It is

608
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
along this thing

609
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
like this.

610
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Hey.

611
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Up five, down five.

612
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
There is a positive five here.

613
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
There is a negative five here.

614
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Then you

615
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm sorry to let you imagine.

616
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Just look at it from here.

617
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
You will see

618
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
there are ten things.

619
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
At that time, he felt

620
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
that he was

621
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
like this.

622
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
A rotating

623
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
twin like this.

624
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Um.

625
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
OK.

626
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Then at that time

627
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
until 1987

628
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Professor Tsai An-pong

629
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
he was

630
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
uh

631
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
he was originally

632
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
made of non-metallic alloy

633
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
and then made a picture

634
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Oh!

635
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
It seems

636
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
to look like gold.

637
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
He started

638
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
to think it was interesting

639
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
because he thought it was beautiful.

640
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Why

641
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
can you make so many spots?

642
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
He saw a lot of points

643
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
and he was very happy.

644
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Then he started to make gold.

645
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Then at the beginning

646
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
in fact, this alloy

647
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
this thing

648
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
he was very early

649
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
very early

650
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
very early

651
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
in the 1930s

652
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
there was already an image.

653
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
He was in a very quiet area.

654
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
He did not

655
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
he wrote a question mark.

656
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Then he

657
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
just tried it at that time.

658
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Just go around there

659
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
and do it

660
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
do it

661
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
do it

662
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
do it

663
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
do it

664
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
do it

665
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Then he thought

666
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
what is it?

667
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Just

668
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh!

669
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
It's done.

670
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Then heat treatment

671
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
He started to do

672
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
quench

673
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
is to do

674
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
fast cooling

675
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
and then

676
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
do the general

677
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
alloy

678
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
and then

679
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
found that after the heat treatment

680
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Hey!

681
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
He is the same thing.

682
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
So

683
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
at that time

684
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
it was called

685
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
heat-stable

686
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
heat-stable crystal.

687
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Then we can see

688
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
here

689
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
he has a very beautiful

690
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Dodecahedron

691
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
a shape

692
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
This is

693
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
one of them

694
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Dodecahedron

695
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Then here we will see

696
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Generally in the index

697
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
When quenching

698
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
We will use

699
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
six indexes

700
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
This is what I just said

701
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Because quenching itself

702
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
has no cycle

703
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
So we have to

704
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
project it to the end

705
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Do

706
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
After using two indexes to describe it

707
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Go again

708
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Write it out

709
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
So here we are

710
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
We will know

711
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
The definition of quenching

712
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
There will be a few conditions

713
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
It must have

714
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Traditional quenching

715
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
non-existent

716
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
The first is

717
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
The rotation property of the crystal

718
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Then the second is

719
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
It must be

720
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Have a

721
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Quasi-periodic

722
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Ordered

723
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
This thing

724
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Because it has a

725
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Very sharp

726
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Diffraction spots

727
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Then we describe

728
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
When this quenching

729
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
We will at least

730
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Need to use

731
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Three axis of導之空間

732
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
To describe it

733
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
That

734
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
The more interesting thing is

735
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
In fact, if

736
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Uh

737
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
For

738
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
The golden ratio is very interesting

739
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
This tau is the golden ratio

740
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Actually

741
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Uh

742
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
The pentagon

743
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
This

744
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
When it cuts

745
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
We go to find it

746
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Some nodes

747
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Go to both sides

748
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
When doing a subtraction

749
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Will get a golden ratio

750
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
This is the thing

751
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
That's why

752
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Quenching

753
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Will be like this in the array

754
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
That

755
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
I seem to have a structure later

756
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I'll talk about it in detail

757
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Why is it like this

758
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Okay, everyone will be curious

759
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Quenching in actual space

760
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
What will it be like

761
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
In fact

762
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
If we look at it from the second dimension

763
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Its array is a

764
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Just

765
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
This penrose

766
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
This penrose pattern

767
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
This is in

768
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Uh

769
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
The two-dimensional state in space

770
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
What about the three-dimensional state

771
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
That's what I just said

772
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
In fact, we use it more often

773
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Is this

774
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Icosahedron

775
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
In fact, so far

776
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
The development of quenching

777
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
There are already various

778
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Different clusters

779
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Various different forms

780
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Even

781
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Actually

782
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Linus Pauling

783
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Although the quenching

784
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Is not a

785
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
The real

786
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Material state

787
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
But its drive also tells

788
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Uh

789
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Another thing that comes out

790
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Is the so-called

791
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Quenching crystal

792
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Everyone take a look

793
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Can you see it?

794
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Take a look

795
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
These two things we can see

796
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Top

797
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Let me compare the top ball

798
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
This one

799
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Yes yes yes

800
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
The big red cluster

801
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
These two things

802
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
It's actually the same thing

803
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
But

804
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
If you are in the case of quenching

805
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
It will be like this

806
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Keep connecting

807
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Keep connecting

808
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
That may be less connected here

809
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Only three and a half units are connected here

810
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
When you keep extending

811
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
You will see different situations

812
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
If you are interested, you can come and visit

813
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
We are

814
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
On the platform

815
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Then the other one is

816
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Pauling

817
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Pauling

818
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
At that time

819
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
To quench

820
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
He just thinks

821
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
This is actually just a kind of

822
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Uh

823
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
In the cubic

824
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
A double crystal structure

825
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
So your

826
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Uh

827
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Quenching crystal

828
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
It will

829
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Uh

830
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
It may exist in a certain position in its corner

831
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Then continue to combine

832
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Combine

833
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
That

834
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
This is actually

835
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
We later

836
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
It is a kind of

837
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Uh

838
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
We call 110 quenching crystal

839
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Or 11 quenching crystal

840
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Or

841
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Uh

842
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
32 quenching

843
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
21 quenching crystal

844
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Or 32 quenching crystal

845
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
That

846
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
This is in the case of high-dimensional projection

847
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
His

848
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Long-edged brush and short-edged brush

849
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
A

850
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Convex state

851
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Then there is

852
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Uh

853
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
It is

854
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
A

855
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Convex

856
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Convex

857
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Convex

858
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Convex

859
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Convex

860
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Then there is another state

861
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Is

862
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Purely 10-axis symmetrical

863
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
This thing

864
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
We call

865
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Uh

866
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Delta

867
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Um

868
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Decagonal type

869
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
That

870
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
This thing will appear in

871
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Also appear in the aluminum convex crystal

872
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
That

873
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
This thing

874
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
It will have a very strong

875
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Impression

876
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Because

877
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
We are from this

878
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
If our

879
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
It will actually have a lot of

880
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Phonon drag

881
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
With some

882
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Radiation

883
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Because it has more

884
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Phason

885
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Ah

886
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Phason can actually be understood as

887
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Uh

888
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
A defect in the convex

889
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Or dislocation

890
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
The part

891
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Then it is here

892
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
It is a very symmetrical

893
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
A symmetrical structure

894
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Uh

895
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
So his side

896
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Um

897
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
That kind of radiation

898
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
What

899
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Isolation rate

900
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Will be

901
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
In

902
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Vertical

903
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
That

904
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Very, very much

905
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Um

906
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
That

907
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
This stable

908
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Stable convex crystal in thermodynamics

909
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Just for

910
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Our

911
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
This

912
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
The crystal brings a new definition

913
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Because in the past

914
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
What I just said

915
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
The definition of the so-called convex crystal is

916
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Uh

917
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
In a solid

918
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Its atoms are all

919
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Have a

920
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Stable

921
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Line

922
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
And it can be

923
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Flat

924
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
And it has a certain

925
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Rotational properties

926
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
That

927
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
What is the new definition

928
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Is

929
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
We can all

930
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
In

931
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
That

932
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Causing the space to find

933
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Any symmetry

934
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
When

935
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
We will call it

936
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Is a kind of convex

937
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
That this

938
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
This is a new view of matter

939
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Ok

940
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Then I will now cut into

941
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
The part of the eye is

942
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Uh

943
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Stability of the convex crystal

944
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
In fact, this is

945
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
At the beginning

946
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Mr. Tsai is doing this

947
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
He also said

948
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
He just wanted to say

949
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Ah

950
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Why can I make aluminum copper iron

951
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Ah

952
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Other

953
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Is there any other way

954
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Can

955
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Uh

956
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
So

957
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
This

958
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
This

959
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
This

960
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
You can use this

961
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
It's all

962
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Ah

963
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
The third is

964
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Uh

965
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
One of the more important points is

966
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
His

967
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Average electronic density

968
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
That

969
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
In the aluminum alkyl

970
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
We have one

971
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
More common E over A value

972
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
We call E over A value

973
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Called 1.8

974
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Then we are in our circle

975
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
We call magic number

976
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Then the second stability factor is

977
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
We can start with this

978
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Average electronic density

979
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
And our

980
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Uh

981
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
From that

982
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
In the electromagnetic radiation space

983
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
See his

984
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
The amount of G

985
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
We can assess

986
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Say his

987
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
That

988
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Polycarbonate

989
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
With

990
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Phenol

991
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Uh, our phenol

992
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
In fact, it is a

993
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Phenol

994
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Because in fact, we can't really estimate it

995
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
We just use a static value

996
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Go to him

997
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
To solve him

998
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
This thing can be seen

999
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
He is

1000
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
It has something to do with his E over A

1001
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Then

1002
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
We can get

1003
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Such a relationship

1004
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Then we see

1005
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Aluminum alkyl

1006
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Is

1007
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
This is the aluminum alkyl with the transition element

1008
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Aluminum alkyl

1009
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
He will follow this relationship

1010
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
But in this aluminum alkyl of Cd

1011
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
His

1012
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
E over A is actually equal to 2

1013
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
That

1014
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
This thing

1015
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
He later

1016
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
We have observed that he has a

1017
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
SPD track

1018
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
The effect of miscellaneous

1019
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Will cause in that

1020
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Near the aluminum alkyl

1021
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
A widening of the track area

1022
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Then this

1023
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
So currently actually

1024
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Aluminum alkyl

1025
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
In this so-called E over A

1026
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
There is no one

1027
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Better

1028
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Or more complete

1029
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Regulation

1030
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Then this is also one of our

1031
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Challenge now

1032
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
That

1033
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
But this is a

1034
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
More controversial

1035
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
That is

1036
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Generally we know that aluminum is

1037
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Three elements

1038
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Three elements

1039
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
He wears three

1040
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
The same normal

1041
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
He has an electrolyte

1042
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Wear one

1043
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Then why is the iron

1044
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
About negative 2.66

1045
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
This is

1046
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
In the previous

1047
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Calculated one

1048
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
A

1049
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
The probability of splitting the track

1050
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
A probability

1051
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Iron in this system

1052
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
He must be in

1053
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Negative 2.66

1054
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
That this is also a

1055
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Very interesting place

1056
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
That is

1057
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
How do we use this

1058
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Full element

1059
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Go

1060
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Um

1061
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Use elements of aluminum alkyl

1062
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Go

1063
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Adjust some of his features

1064
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Is he

1065
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
DS

1066
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Or his

1067
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Some of the effects of track miscellaneous

1068
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
That time we went to iron

1069
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Rutanium

1070
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Then

1071
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Oslim

1072
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Sit down like this

1073
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Find out

1074
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
They are in the same group

1075
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Under the circumstances

1076
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Their outermost

1077
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Electrolyte state is the same

1078
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
These can be done

1079
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Very stable nodule

1080
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Then

1081
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
I made a mistake

1082
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Ah

1083
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I put the wrong side

1084
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
This TMG

1085
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
This line

1086
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I'm sorry

1087
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
That

1088
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
It's about 1.8 here

1089
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
That

1090
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
In this part

1091
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
More people are doing

1092
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Is

1093
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Developing towards hot metal

1094
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Or

1095
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
They go

1096
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Want to see

1097
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Inside a cluster

1098
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
If he lacks a

1099
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Will it lead him to the whole

1100
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
That

1101
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Metal sword

1102
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
The price

1103
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Ah

1104
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
A transfer phenomenon

1105
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
At present

1106
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
They use that

1107
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
That

1108
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
The way of man-made engineering

1109
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
In

1110
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Make this prediction

1111
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,400
What is the element of half the number

1112
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Um

1113
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Some of you

1114
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Composite

1115
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
What is that

1116
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Composition

1117
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
What

1118
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Ah

1119
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
This is actually

1120
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
His

1121
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
It's all 100

1122
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
It's all 100

1123
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
It's all 100

1124
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
This is the original ratio

1125
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Ah

1126
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Then we will follow this original ratio

1127
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Let's say

1128
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Ah

1129
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,400
This aluminum is

1130
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
With three additives

1131
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Multiply by 3

1132
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Then this is multiplied by 1

1133
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
That 12 is multiplied by 2.66

1134
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Then finally it is a total of 100

1135
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Divide by 100

1136
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
We can calculate this

1137
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
A value of 1 over a

1138
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
A value of 1 over a

1139
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Um

1140
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
That this is currently a

1141
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
A more stable nodule

1142
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
A list

1143
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
If you are interested

1144
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
You can take a look

1145
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Hey

1146
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Maybe it's related to your

1147
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Uh

1148
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
You can take it and do it

1149
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
There are some

1150
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
In the structure

1151
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Some more

1152
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Different or special

1153
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Some things

1154
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
That is actually the easiest now

1155
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Applied by the business

1156
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Maybe it's this

1157
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Aluminum and the transition element

1158
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
This part

1159
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Because it also contains more

1160
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
The price is cheaper

1161
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
So

1162
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
More suitable for mass production

1163
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
That if it is for

1164
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Say

1165
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Do basic research

1166
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Will be more

1167
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
If you are interested

1168
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Isn't this guess

1169
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Teacher Cai

1170
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Ah

1171
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
That this

1172
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
You can go from here

1173
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
He will

1174
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Can make

1175
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
More likely to make

1176
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Two-dimensional nodules

1177
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
This thing

1178
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Uh

1179
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
On the combination of nodules

1180
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
The concept is a little different

1181
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Then I will introduce a little bit

1182
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Nodule

1183
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
It's in

1184
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
It's obviously made of metal

1185
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
That

1186
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Oh, yeah, from the picture just now

1187
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
You can know

1188
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Most nodules are made of metal

1189
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
That

1190
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Let's take a look at it

1191
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
In

1192
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Different

1193
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Its hardness and its

1194
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Uh

1195
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Um

1196
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Electrode

1197
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
When it's low temperature

1198
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Uh

1199
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
In fact

1200
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Nodule

1201
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
It is a

1202
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Negative temperature factor

1203
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
It's a negative temperature factor

1204
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
So you see

1205
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
That

1206
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Iron, aluminum, copper

1207
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
When it's high temperature, the electrons rise

1208
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
It's obviously a combination of aluminum and copper and iron

1209
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
When it's high temperature

1210
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
It's a drop

1211
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
thing

1212
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
So

1213
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
In this place

1214
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
It's on the electromagnetic field

1215
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
It's closer to the semiconductor

1216
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
That

1217
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
It's not that it's all semiconductors

1218
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
We usually call it metal

1219
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
That

1220
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
This thing

1221
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Its attraction

1222
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
At the moment at high temperature

1223
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Some people will target its phasing

1224
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
That's what I was talking about

1225
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
That

1226
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
In the so-called full space

1227
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Some interactions

1228
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
The state

1229
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
They think it's like this

1230
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
There is no better explanation yet

1231
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Interpretation

1232
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
That

1233
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
If you look at it from the age

1234
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
If you look at it from the age

1235
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
It's got a microscope

1236
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
That

1237
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Only electrons can see that

1238
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Microscope

1239
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
It may block some of the effects

1240
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Or let it jump

1241
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Um

1242
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
In terms of hardness

1243
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Uh

1244
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
This is the general

1245
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Uh

1246
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Steel is iron

1247
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Iron alloy

1248
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Then

1249
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Their hardness is very, very low

1250
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
It's very, very hard when it's combined

1251
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Ah

1252
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
If you look at it from the defect

1253
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
You can say that the whole body

1254
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
It's all defects

1255
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
It's very, very hard

1256
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
But on the contrary

1257
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
It's also very, very crisp

1258
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
That

1259
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
This is currently more likely

1260
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
And possible applications

1261
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
In fact, there are quite a few

1262
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
That

1263
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Because like I said

1264
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
It's very crisp

1265
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
So usually we use the way of the body

1266
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
To do

1267
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Uh

1268
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Some crystal products

1269
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Or by coating

1270
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Because we want to make the body smaller

1271
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
We can ignore it

1272
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Some

1273
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Some harder temperament

1274
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
That

1275
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Like

1276
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
It's more interesting in this part of the blowing

1277
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Many people will use this crystal

1278
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Ah

1279
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
He went to do that

1280
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Get rid of the aluminum in it

1281
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
That's like copper, iron

1282
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Copper itself for

1283
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Uh, carbon dioxide

1284
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
It has the characteristic of blowing

1285
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Its copper just happens to be on some specific

1286
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Edge

1287
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
In the corner of the crystal

1288
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
At this time it will

1289
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Because it has some special

1290
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Uh

1291
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Double crystal structure

1292
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
So it has a better impact on the blowing

1293
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
I think this part is more interesting

1294
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
That there is another part

1295
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
In that

1296
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Metal

1297
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
The part of the metal compound

1298
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Now the metal compound

1299
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
For the crystal

1300
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
There are mainly two directions

1301
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
One is mainly

1302
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Put the crystal into

1303
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Uh

1304
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Aluminum alloy

1305
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Lala

1306
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Boil it up

1307
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
The other way is to use

1308
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Aluminum alloy

1309
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
After making the aluminum alloy

1310
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Then suck it out again

1311
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
And then at high temperature

1312
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Rebound

1313
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Uh

1314
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
A high intensity effect

1315
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
That crystal

1316
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Because the surface of the body is very low

1317
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
So it has a very low friction factor

1318
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Then

1319
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Also very brittle

1320
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Then I will show you later

1321
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Uh, some of the current

1322
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Crystal products

1323
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Ah, there seems to be a film

1324
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Ah

1325
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Ah

1326
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Okay, how did the crystal come out?

1327
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I just talked so much

1328
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
How did the crystal come out?

1329
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
This is a

1330
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
More traditional

1331
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
The production of a crystal

1332
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Ah

1333
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
A metal

1334
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
The relationship of manufacturing

1335
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
That generally uses

1336
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Uh

1337
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Metal steam or metal liquid

1338
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
If you start with metal liquid

1339
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
If you start with metal liquid

1340
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Very reasonable

1341
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Uh

1342
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Very reasonable to understand

1343
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Is like

1344
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Casting ah

1345
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Aluminum alloy ah

1346
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
These methods

1347
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
If we cool down quickly

1348
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Will get this

1349
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Aluminum alloy

1350
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Then we cool down slowly

1351
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Will get the crystal

1352
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
In fact, thermodynamics

1353
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Stable crystal

1354
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
In fact, when you cool down slowly

1355
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
It can also get a crystal

1356
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Then I just talked about

1357
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Extracted from aluminum alloy

1358
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Stable crystal

1359
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
It's easy to get out of the treasure box

1360
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Ah, the alloy of the treasure box

1361
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Then use the method of actual effect

1362
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Let it suck it out

1363
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
This is

1364
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
From

1365
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Uh

1366
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
A part of the crystal to the crystal

1367
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
That

1368
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
From the non-crystal

1369
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
There is also this thing

1370
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
There will also be this thing

1371
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
That is, Mr. Tsai

1372
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Why did you start

1373
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
A reason for making a stable crystal

1374
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
That

1375
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Like

1376
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
At present, someone will also use

1377
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
That

1378
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
PVD

1379
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
PVD way to make a stable crystal

1380
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
But

1381
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Uh

1382
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
In terms of the control of the treasure

1383
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Or some conditions

1384
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
In fact, to make a very high quality

1385
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Uh

1386
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Stable crystal

1387
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Will be

1388
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
It's still a big challenge

1389
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
That

1390
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
That

1391
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
That

1392
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
This is what I just summarized

1393
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Uh

1394
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
The so-called processes just now

1395
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
In fact, this side is

1396
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
We are more common

1397
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Some

1398
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Some methods of manufacturing stable crystals

1399
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Including

1400
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Just the general

1401
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Traditional casting

1402
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
There is also that

1403
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
High-speed cooling

1404
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Uh

1405
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Beat

1406
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
The cooling speed per second

1407
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
It's probably more than 3000 degrees

1408
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Very fast

1409
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Then this

1410
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
This is also a very fast

1411
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Cooling

1412
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Uh

1413
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
The latter two are relatively rare

1414
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I just

1415
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Another one is to use mechanical alloy

1416
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Is to put a bunch of elements

1417
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Put it together

1418
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
And then it's high energy

1419
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Put it together

1420
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,400
It's like doing high-speed alloy

1421
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Someone does it

1422
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
And then like that

1423
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
This is the general

1424
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Uh

1425
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
PVD

1426
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
PVD like this

1427
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
But there is a very important point

1428
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Is that

1429
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
If it is not processed

1430
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
It's actually very rare

1431
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Very high quality

1432
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Very high quality

1433
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Very high quality

1434
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Very high quality

1435
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Unless it is

1436
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Certain

1437
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Some very specific stable crystals

1438
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Can get a better way

1439
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Uh

1440
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
A better one

1441
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Uh

1442
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Structure

1443
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Structure

1444
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Structure

1445
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
That

1446
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Finally, let me introduce

1447
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
We just mentioned so much

1448
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Uh

1449
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Uh

1450
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
The crystal will become

1451
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Uh

1452
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
The crystal can run out of the stable crystal

1453
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Uh

1454
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
This is a thin one

1455
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
And then

1456
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Can we

1457
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Let the crystal

1458
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Directly become a stable crystal

1459
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
This is our recent

1460
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
A

1461
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
A new discovery is that we can

1462
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Indeed

1463
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
In a special way

1464
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
In a special way

1465
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Uh

1466
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Uh

1467
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
Make the crystal

1468
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Make the crystal

1469
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Gradually become a stable crystal

1470
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Then we get a composite material

1471
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Then

1472
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Here is a

1473
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
The one I just saw

1474
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
One of the shapes of the dodecahedron

1475
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
And here

1476
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
The composition may not be very good

1477
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Just happened to take a pretty picture

1478
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Just happened to take a pretty picture

1479
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Ah

1480
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Ah

1481
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Next is

1482
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
The one I just mentioned

1483
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Tolstien Hart

1484
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
He is

1485
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
He thinks

1486
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Nobel Prize should be given to him

1487
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Why didn't you give it to him

1488
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
He also wrote a letter to protest

1489
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Anyway

1490
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
He is still very passionate

1491
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
He is

1492
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
In that

1493
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
In a meteorite pit in Russia

1494
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Found the so-called natural dodecahedron

1495
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
This is a picture of a high-density

1496
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
You can see a very beautiful one

1497
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
A pattern of a dodecahedron

1498
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Uh

1499
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,400
I just talked to Sol

1500
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
He still says

1501
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
We were 45

1502
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
45 years ago

1503
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
You can find the dodecahedron

1504
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
It must be in the universe

1505
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Tell us what the message is

1506
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Is it

1507
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Dodecahedron is a

1508
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
A very common state in the universe

1509
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
But if you finish watching

1510
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Just introduced the dodecahedron

1511
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
How did it come out

1512
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
You should be able to understand

1513
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Actually in the process of falling like this in the meteorite pit

1514
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
It's a little bit like

1515
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
After melting quickly

1516
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Quickly cool

1517
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
That is, it happens to be very likely

1518
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
A substance that will produce this

1519
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
I think it's pretty reasonable

1520
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
But

1521
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
I also think he's right

1522
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
If we can

1523
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Understand whether the dodecahedron is in the universe

1524
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Very stable

1525
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Maybe for the future

1526
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Application is a great help

1527
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
That may be in recent years

1528
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
In the dodecahedron

1529
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
A part that everyone pays more attention to

1530
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Mainly in that

1531
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
In the dodecahedron

1532
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Some of its special physical properties

1533
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
That includes

1534
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
I have found this

1535
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Eterbium in that

1536
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Quasi-crystal

1537
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Uh, in the dodecahedron

1538
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
That one

1539
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Uh

1540
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Additive ratio

1541
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Then another one is

1542
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
Magnetic connection

1543
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Its magnetic and

1544
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Magnetic connection

1545
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
It's also found in the dodecahedron

1546
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
And then there's the so-called

1547
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
The superconductive

1548
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
It's usually oxidized dodecahedron

1549
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Superconductive

1550
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Then we are in a very low temperature

1551
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Someone found a simple dodecahedron

1552
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
You can also find this thing

1553
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Is that in the future we can also start

1554
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
The so-called

1555
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
In their research

1556
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Use that so-called

1557
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
The dodecahedron and the dodecahedron

1558
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Comparison together

1559
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
That is a

1560
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Periodic

1561
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
A comparison of periodicity and periodicity

1562
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Found this thing

1563
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
That's the last one

1564
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
I just talked about

1565
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
A product of our dodecahedron

1566
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
I'm not sure if I can see it

1567
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
That's the bottom

1568
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
This white part

1569
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
This is what we do

1570
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
A product of dodecahedron

1571
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
That we didn't add any oil

1572
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
I didn't add anything

1573
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Just put the eggs on top

1574
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Roasted

1575
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Look at the top

1576
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
This

1577
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
The part of the oil has been covered

1578
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
But the bottom is completely dry

1579
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
So we are doing dodecahedron now

1580
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I hope

1581
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
There's no way to make a high-quality dodecahedron

1582
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
And then maybe in the near future

1583
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Replace the dodecahedron as soon as possible

1584
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
In the entire national market

1585
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Even in the shipping market

1586
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
This is what I did this year

1587
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
At the European conference

1588
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
We discussed a few questions

1589
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
We are not yet

1590
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
To discuss these things in depth

1591
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
But if you are interested in joining the dodecahedron in the future

1592
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
You can continue to do this

1593
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Includes

1594
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
How to make a larger

1595
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
A better dodecahedron feed

1596
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
And then do a partial

1597
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Electronic communication characteristics

1598
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Exploration

1599
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Because dodecahedron itself is a

1600
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
A lot of things

1601
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
The other is

1602
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
This is the part that I didn't follow

1603
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Is it

1604
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Phenomenon or non-phenomenon

1605
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
There's really a phenomenon

1606
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
So we've been talking about

1607
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
Dodecahedron surface

1608
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Dodecahedron surface

1609
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
But he really has

1610
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
This is

1611
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Because we use a lot of dodecahedron models

1612
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
This thing is a

1613
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
In

1614
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Mathematics may be more

1615
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Challenging thing

1616
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
The last one is me

1617
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
I always feel like

1618
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
We should go find a

1619
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
New dodecahedron

1620
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
New dodecahedron

1621
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Because now the dodecahedron is actually

1622
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Relatively low melting point

1623
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Since it's so good at high temperature

1624
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
We can't find

1625
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
A higher temperature dodecahedron

1626
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
This thing may be for the future

1627
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Whether it's on the aircraft

1628
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Or on the ship

1629
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
Will be better help

1630
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Then I will make a concluding remark

1631
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Is

1632
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Yes, dodecahedron is the third kind of solid matter

1633
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Then its thermal stability

1634
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
In fact, compared to the general

1635
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
High entropy

1636
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Alloy or

1637
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Amorphous

1638
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
It has better thermal stability

1639
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
That

1640
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Dodecahedron

1641
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
It can be found in many nuclei

1642
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
And even in the universe

1643
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
That

1644
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
The following is

1645
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
In fact, the most important thing is this

1646
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
How are we going to

1647
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
From dodecahedron

1648
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
We can understand

1649
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
What is the definition of a new structure

1650
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
Are we going to define it in three dimensions

1651
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Or in

1652
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Causing space to define it

1653
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Or we can define it in six dimensions

1654
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
This is a very worthwhile question

1655
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
That's the last

1656
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
Thank you for listening

1657
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Then we can take a look

1658
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
The picture on the right

1659
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
I chose

1660
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
The picture on the left is not very good

1661
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
I picked a little bit

1662
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
In fact, it looks like

1663
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,400
It looks like a dodecahedron

1664
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,400
But if we put

1665
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
After all the lines are drawn

1666
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Will find

1667
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,400
Hey

1668
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
This thing is what we just saw

1669
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
That penrose pattern

1670
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Is exactly the same

1671
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
So sometimes our eyes

1672
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Can't see the real situation

1673
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
But electrons can be our eyes

1674
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Let us see

1675
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Hey

1676
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
What does the real atom look like

1677
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
That

1678
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Today

1679
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
It's almost time

1680
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Thank you all

1681
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
If you have any questions

1682
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Welcome to discuss

1683
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Applause

1684
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Ok

1685
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Hello everyone

1686
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Thank you

1687
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Hey

1688
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
OK

1689
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Is there anything you want to ask

1690
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Any questions

1691
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
For those of you

1692
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
who want to know

1693
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Hi

1694
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Just

1695
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Hello

1696
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Well

1697
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
I want to know

1698
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Is that you

1699
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
How do you define

1700
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Its three-dimensional structure

1701
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
How do you define its

1702
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Defects

1703
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
For example

1704
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Dislocation

1705
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Or stacking fault

1706
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Or grain boundary

1707
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Oh

1708
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
This thing

1709
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Is

1710
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
In fact, we are now

1711
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
I don't know how to discuss

1712
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Yes

1713
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
But

1714
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
This is the general whole

1715
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
A situation of actual atomic array

1716
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
In fact

1717
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
It is difficult for us to find a complete cut

1718
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,400
You see, it seems to be flat here

1719
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
It seems to be flat

1720
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
But it's broken

1721
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,400
So we usually define

1722
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
When it comes to accuracy

1723
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Let's look at that defect

1724
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Look at this

1725
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
This two fat

1726
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
One is fat

1727
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
That rhombohedron

1728
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
And the other one is flatter

1729
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
That

1730
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Hey

1731
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Can I use the performance

1732
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
No

1733
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Usually we

1734
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
When it comes to the defect of accuracy

1735
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,400
It's that the origin is always moving

1736
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
It's always changing

1737
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
But it's always

1738
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
The form of stable accuracy

1739
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
No matter how it alternates

1740
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,400
It's always

1741
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
A form of stable accuracy

1742
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,400
I'll give you an example of a cluster

1743
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
It's like

1744
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
It's got a very strong polarity

1745
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
It's a very strong polarity

1746
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
It's a very strong polarity

1747
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
How do we define dislocation

1748
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,400
It's actually a bit difficult

1749
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
But we can use it

1750
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
If

1751
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
If

1752
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,400
Hey

1753
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
Today

1754
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
One of the fatter things

1755
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
This

1756
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,400
This thing

1757
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,400
It's a relatively big thing

1758
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
If it suddenly

1759
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,400
These two yellow ones go this way

1760
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
This green one goes this way

1761
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,400
We will only define such a defect

1762
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
We call it a defect of phasing

1763
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,400
So if it's dislocation or

1764
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Uh

1765
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Stack and fold

1766
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,400
We don't have a clear definition

1767
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,400
Hello

1768
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,400
Hello

1769
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
Hello

1770
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
Hello

1771
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,400
Hello

1772
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Sorry, can I ask a question now?

1773
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,400
But the first one seems to be

1774
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Hi, welcome

1775
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Okay, so my question is actually very simple

1776
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
You just said

1777
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Most of the clusters are in

1778
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
Intermetallic

1779
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Found in the middle

1780
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,400
That's the reason

1781
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Is there a possibility that

1782
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
Uh, for example, in oxidized materials

1783
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Or other substances

1784
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,400
Found in clusters

1785
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Oh

1786
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
In fact, this is also a very interesting topic

1787
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
In fact, in 2008

1788
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
A lot of people in that

1789
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
In the clusters

1790
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
Found the so-called seven symmetries

1791
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
With some special

1792
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,400
Inexplicable symmetries

1793
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Do you have this?

1794
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Yes

1795
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
But is it really so intermediate?

1796
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
We can go and see

1797
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,400
This pentagonal intermediate array

1798
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
It can be so full

1799
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
It's because it happens to be able to use two

1800
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Symmetry to put it up

1801
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
In fact, this

1802
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
This pentagonal intermediate array

1803
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
It has many ways to fight

1804
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
If you say

1805
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Is it possible to happen in ceramics?

1806
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
But you have to think about ceramics

1807
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,400
It has a stronger

1808
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
So it might be more

1809
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
Forced to be in a certain

1810
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
In an agglomerated position

1811
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
So I'm not sure if it's going to form

1812
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
That kind of framework

1813
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,400
But if it's a high-density

1814
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
It's true that someone found out

1815
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,400
I don't seem to have answered the question

1816
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,400
Thank you

1817
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Did I answer your question?

1818
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,400
Sorry

1819
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
No problem

1820
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
I'm just curious about the reason

1821
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Because it's yours

1822
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
Is the size of your atom the same?

1823
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,400
Or is it related to the metal ring itself?

1824
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
You mean why?

1825
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,400
I don't quite understand what you mean

1826
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
You can talk about it again

1827
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,400
That's what you just said

1828
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Your answer is more biased

1829
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
Just because your

1830
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
The size of the atom must be biased

1831
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
So it can fill this

1832
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
That's the edge

1833
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Is that what you mean?

1834
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
No, because your atom is too big

1835
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,400
Just keep pushing it

1836
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Push, push, push

1837
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,400
It doesn't necessarily push

1838
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
What you want

1839
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
But most importantly

1840
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
If the atom is too big

1841
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,400
It can't fit in at all

1842
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,400
We're going to put it in today

1843
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,400
In a specific space

1844
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,400
We

1845
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
In general, we have to say

1846
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
Because like here

1847
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,400
It has an atom

1848
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,400
Atomic Size Factor

1849
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,400
The size of the atom

1850
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,400
If this thing

1851
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
When the radius is too big

1852
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
It's a little bit

1853
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
It's going to form a very large force field

1854
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
This force field may make it

1855
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,400
The whole structure will collapse

1856
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,400
I see

1857
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,400
Like there's a fat guy

1858
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,400
There's a fat guy going to the cinema

1859
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,400
The people next to him were knocked over

1860
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
He just didn't feel well

1861
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
I see

1862
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
So how did he get sick?

1863
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,400
It's kind of like the law of physics

1864
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,400
Oh

1865
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
I see

1866
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,400
Then you have a

1867
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,400
What is the density of the atom

1868
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Does this have anything to do with 1 and 3?

1869
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Or

1870
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
1 and 3 themselves

1871
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,400
There is no absolute relationship

1872
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Because this is actually the third point

1873
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
We got it from the experiment

1874
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
A

1875
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
Experienced

1876
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,400
If you look here

1877
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
It's true that we're in this kind of

1878
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,400
Green

1879
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
In the three-dimensional solution

1880
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,400
It will meet this condition

1881
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,400
But if you are in the second dimension

1882
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,400
Or some

1883
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,400
In the case of fractured orbit

1884
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Or in

1885
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
It will have some

1886
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,400
It's a separate experience

1887
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,400
It's a separate experience

1888
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,400
But you have to meet three at the same time

1889
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
What's the second one?

1890
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
The second one is that the density can't be too big

1891
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,400
Otherwise, the atomic property will be too strong

1892
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,400
How to quantify too much

1893
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
How to quantify too much

1894
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,400
It's really a good question

1895
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,400
Um

1896
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
In fact, we usually say

1897
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Don't exceed

1898
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,400
Density of 20% or more

1899
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
1 and 3 is also the density

1900
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,400
No, the second one is the density

1901
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
The second one is the density

1902
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
I thought it was some kind of formula

1903
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,400
In fact, I also want to say

1904
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
We've been discussing it before

1905
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,400
Right right right

1906
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Hi

1907
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Oh, I see someone

1908
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
I'm here

1909
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
Um

1910
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Decagonal products are less

1911
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
Is there any reason?

1912
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
Because I only listed it today

1913
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Um

1914
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,400
Stable

1915
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,400
Oxide crystal

1916
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,400
So decagonal is less

1917
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,400
Because most of the decagonal

1918
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,400
It's more like

1919
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,400
Metastable

1920
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,400
It's a stable state

1921
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,400
That

1922
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
In fact, we have been discussing in the past few years

1923
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,400
One of the more important points is that

1924
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
We know how to make stable accuracy

1925
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
We know how to make stable accuracy

1926
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
But we still don't know

1927
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Why is the accuracy stable?

1928
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,400
What is its origin?

1929
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,400
We still can't design

1930
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,400
A better experiment to verify

1931
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Why is the accuracy stable?

1932
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Sorry to go back to that question

1933
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
You said that you still can't determine

1934
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,400
Why is the accuracy stable?

1935
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,400
From this point, there is no way to do

1936
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
DFT or quantum chemistry

1937
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,400
Go from the structure of the generation

1938
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,400
Or the electrical structure to understand

1939
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Why is it stable?

1940
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,400
Oh, I think this question is good

1941
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,400
But usually we have to do DFT

1942
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Or when you do this

1943
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,400
We have a very important thing

1944
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Your wave function must have periodicity

1945
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
but

1946
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Yes, yes, periodic boundary conditions

1947
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
Yes, yes, yes, yes

1948
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
But the accuracy, it has a periodicity

1949
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,400
This accurate periodicity

1950
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
It's a magnetic fraction

1951
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
So you can't do DFT

1952
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,400
But we are also in the current stage

1953
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
There are some advanced ways to do

1954
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
We put the accuracy

1955
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
In a specific cubic structure

1956
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,400
It will be very similar

1957
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,400
It has a very similar symmetry

1958
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,400
You can do it in this case

1959
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,400
But so why is it actually a magnetic fraction

1960
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,400
It's easier to find than accuracy

1961
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
A lot of people have been like this recently

1962
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,400
Yes

1963
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Then if it's because like DFT

1964
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Periodic boundary conditions are very important

1965
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,400
What if it's a quantum chemistry method?

1966
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
For example, Gaussian

1967
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Or it doesn't need periodic boundary conditions

1968
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
It is directly

1969
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
It's not using pseudo-potential

1970
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,400
It is directly using the real atomic orbital

1971
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,400
Then calculate some of its

1972
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,400
It's the electromagnetic wave function

1973
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,400
It does not consider the periodic brogue wave

1974
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Oh

1975
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,400
Because of this part

1976
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,400
I didn't follow it so carefully

1977
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,400
We can discuss it in private later

1978
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Okay, thank you

1979
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,400
I think this is quite interesting

1980
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
But I remember someone did it

1981
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
But it seems like I'm not sure

1982
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,400
I might have to go back and look at the information

1983
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,400
Because I remember someone did it

1984
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,400
Can I ask a question?

1985
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
Please say

1986
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,400
I want to ask

1987
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,400
I remember

1988
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
Linus Pauling

1989
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,400
He had a big argument before

1990
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
That is to say

1991
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,400
This quantum or an approximate

1992
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Will all produce a similar electromagnetic brogue wave

1993
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,400
Yes

1994
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,400
How do you actually distinguish these two things?

1995
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Ta-da

1996
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,400
In fact, the main thing is

1997
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,400
When the quantum is in the inner circle

1998
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
There must be

1999
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,400
For example, if we see a pentagon here

2000
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,400
There will be a negative pentagon inside

2001
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,400
But we see a pentagon here

2002
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,400
But it's a cubic structure inside

2003
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,400
This is the main thing we can see on the diffraction pattern

2004
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Quasi-crystal and approximate difference

2005
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
This is because now

2006
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
If we can make better feed

2007
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Or better electronic microscope resolution

2008
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
I can see it

2009
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
After all, like the earlier

2010
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,400
If you take this pattern

2011
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,400
You will find that you can see it

2012
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
But its spots are not so beautiful

2013
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
What did he just ask you?

2014
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Quasi-crystal and approximate

2015
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Linus Pauling

2016
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,400
He argued at that time

2017
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,400
If I put some specific pentagons in the cubic

2018
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,400
Then make a double gold

2019
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,400
I will get the same 10-fold diffraction pattern

2020
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
But the two structures

2021
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,400
The folding is different

2022
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,400
But its periodic is different

2023
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,400
So they must have different symmetry

2024
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,400
Or you can just look at this diffraction pattern

2025
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Yes, so these two pictures show

2026
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,400
It's the difference on the diffraction pattern

2027
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Should be able to distinguish

2028
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Yes, yes, yes

2029
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Now it's easier to distinguish

2030
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
It was harder at that time

2031
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
And the most important thing is

2032
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
There is no stable crystalline at that time

2033
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
So it will be an argument point

2034
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Oh, there is another follow-up question

2035
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,400
That is, has anyone tried to do it under low temperature

2036
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,400
Similar structural analysis

2037
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Because in this case

2038
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,400
You are less affected by the phaseon

2039
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

2040
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,400
This is someone doing this thing

2041
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,400
Because I'm not following the low temperature side

2042
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Just look at its physics

2043
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
So if you are interested in this

2044
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,400
We can also discuss it in person

2045
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,400
I didn't follow so much

2046
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,400
But I'm sure someone is doing this part

2047
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
OK, thank you

2048
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,400
I want to know about its electricity

2049
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,400
That's why you just said

2050
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,400
This thing is actually more like a semiconductor

2051
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
Yes

2052
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
Then why is it

2053
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
It looks like metal added

2054
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Why does it become a semiconductor

2055
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,400
Generally, metal is added casually

2056
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,400
It won't be like this if you participate in a magazine

2057
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Yes

2058
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,400
This is also why crystalline is so interesting

2059
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,400
Usually we can have a few points to think about

2060
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Because it's actually a bit complicated

2061
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,400
The first one is that it contains

2062
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,400
Posi-periodicity

2063
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Will it cause its electronic

2064
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,400
Frequency

2065
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,400
Let's say we consider today

2066
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
In micro-spatial motion

2067
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Its posi-periodicity

2068
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,400
It will make its wave function

2069
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,400
There will be a lot of destructive interference

2070
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
It can't transmit very well

2071
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,400
But at high temperature

2072
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,400
Is it because of this energy

2073
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
Because of pseudo-gap C

2074
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,400
There is a second point

2075
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,400
This point is one of them

2076
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,400
The second point I think is more common

2077
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Because pseudo-gap itself

2078
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,400
It's an energy state that can only be seen by electrons

2079
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,400
In fact, when I was doing X-ray recently

2080
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,400
Because the resolution is not enough

2081
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
You have actually found some special phenomena recently

2082
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
But there is no way to see the pseudo-gap

2083
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Did it actually change

2084
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
When this temperature rises

2085
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,400
This temperature dependence will make

2086
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Electrons jump through this pseudo-gap

2087
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
So it makes the oscillation better

2088
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,400
This is also one of the main reasons

2089
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,400
Wait a minute, can you explain

2090
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Why is there a pseudo-gap in this thing?

2091
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,400
How did the pseudo-gap come

2092
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Is this the same thing as the pseudo-gap of superconductivity?

2093
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
Sorry, let me think about it again

2094
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
The word pseudo-gap

2095
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,400
It's usually a word that appears in high-temperature superconductors

2096
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
You just found a gap

2097
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,400
So you call it pseudo-gap

2098
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
You can say that

2099
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
But in fact, this pseudo-gap

2100
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
The most important thing is that

2101
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
When we stabilize the crystallized compound

2102
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,400
The so-called

2103
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,400
Because we went to see the bandgap structure

2104
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
In fact, it is

2105
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
What is the combination?

2106
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
I forgot

2107
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,400
Anyway, its gap

2108
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,400
The most important thing is that it has something to do with Fermi sphere

2109
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,400
We found that the pseudo-gap

2110
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Do you think it has anything to do with high-temperature superconductivity?

2111
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
I don't think it doesn't matter

2112
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Because we are now

2113
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Because I'm not doing this specifically

2114
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
But the author will usually mention

2115
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
I only know the reason for the pseudo-gap

2116
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
But I don't know

2117
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,400
Does it have anything to do with the pseudo-gap of high-temperature superconductivity?

2118
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Your pseudo-gap refers to

2119
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
The pseudo-gap in the bandgap structure

2120
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
OK

2121
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
In its structure

2122
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
There is a gap in the bandstructure

2123
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
Yes, there is a low energy point

2124
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
OK

2125
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,400
So it actually

2126
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,400
Anyway, you said

2127
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Anyway, the result of the calculation

2128
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
There is a gap

2129
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
So it looks like

2130
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,400
It's a bit like a semiconductor

2131
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,400
How big is the gap?

2132
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
How big is the gap?

2133
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
Because each is not the same

2134
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
And in fact, the pseudo-gap of high-temperature superconductivity cannot be calculated

2135
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,400
What I just said

2136
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
The so-called pseudo-gap is all from the near-term solution

2137
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,400
How much is the near-term result?

2138
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
I didn't remember this

2139
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,400
I'll send you the data later

2140
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
This is quite interesting

2141
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,400
Sorry, I just talked about

2142
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,400
You talked about the pseudo-gap

2143
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
This should be able to use

2144
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
Apex to measure

2145
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
You can measure the bandstructure

2146
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,400
I really want to measure it, but I have no chance

2147
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,400
Because

2148
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,400
As you said, the pseudo-gap cannot be calculated

2149
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,400
In fact, the best way is to use Apex

2150
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,400
But

2151
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
I think if there is a chance to make better data

2152
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,400
It is indeed a point to try

2153
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
Because I recently found

2154
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,400
The pn-reverse phenomenon in the pseudo-gap

2155
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
This phenomenon may be with

2156
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,400
Because its structure has not changed at all

2157
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,400
But its

2158
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,400
Eoverlay has not changed

2159
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,400
But it has a very obvious pn-transition

2160
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,400
So

2161
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
If you can use Apex, please tell me

2162
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,400
No, no way

2163
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
I really want to do it

2164
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
Because I think

2165
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
Because there is no way to do it directly

2166
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
Apex usually can only measure

2167
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,400
Measure the valence band, right?

2168
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,400
You can tell me

2169
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,400
To be honest

2170
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,400
I have never done Apex

2171
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,400
I saw a lot of

2172
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
Data is

2173
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,400
Bandstructure

2174
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,400
Apex seems to be able to measure

2175
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,400
I'm not very sure

2176
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,400
Because I don't have it

2177
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,400
Usually need to move

2178
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,400
I see

2179
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,400
So you can see this thing

2180
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,400
Yes

2181
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,400
But

2182
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,400
In fact, it is not very accurate

2183
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Because of the problem of feed processing

2184
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,400
If you don't do it very well

2185
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
Just for reference

2186
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,400
I see

2187
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,400
Can this material be used for doping?

2188
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,400
This question is really good

2189
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,400
Because we thought about it before

2190
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Try to do doping

2191
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,400
But you know

2192
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,400
This thing is already three-dimensional

2193
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,400
If you do doping

2194
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
The structure may be broken, it will be too complicated

2195
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,400
Someone wanted to say before

2196
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
This structure looks like a lot of defects

2197
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
Is it possible to put cyan in it?

2198
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,400
It's not really doping

2199
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,400
But it's a new material

2200
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,400
But after entering, you will find that its structure will collapse

2201
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,400
So now we are less

2202
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Really do doping

2203
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,400
Is it really doping?

2204
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Is also a problem

2205
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,400
Because you can't make it go very smoothly

2206
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
There is too much difference in each place

2207
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,400
Then the second point is

2208
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,400
If we talk about doping

2209
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,400
We will only use substitution at most

2210
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,400
Maybe substitution

2211
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,400
We assume to add a substitution

2212
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,400
A certain element in the cluster

2213
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
To change its nature

2214
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,400
There is no way to do

2215
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,400
Really do doping

2216
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,400
Because the structure may collapse

2217
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,400
Is its doping

2218
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,400
More like BCS?

2219
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,400
Or is it exotic?

2220
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,400
Its doping is actually super bad

2221
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,400
Just have that phenomenon

2222
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
It just found this phenomenon

2223
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,400
There is no breakthrough in the weather

2224
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,400
Just because it doesn't

2225
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,400
Interfere with anything

2226
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,400
But I saw this phenomenon

2227
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,400
But the temperature is super low

2228
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,400
So there is no application value

2229
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,400
But it's interesting to study

2230
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,400
Why don't we use anything

2231
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,400
It has this feature

2232
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
Most of the metal

2233
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,400
Will have BCS doping

2234
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,400
Yes, that's right

2235
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,400
So this thing

2236
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,400
I'm curious about this thing

2237
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,400
Because it's metal

2238
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,400
So it may be a BCS doping

2239
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,400
You said it looks like ceramic

2240
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,400
Like semiconductor

2241
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,400
It may not be normal doping

2242
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Yes, it's not normal

2243
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
It's not normal

2244
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,400
They don't particularly study

2245
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Does it match BCS?

2246
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,400
They are just mentioning a phenomenon

2247
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Because if it can be mentioned

2248
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,400
It should not only be communication

2249
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,400
So they just test it

2250
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Because like I just said

2251
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,400
Our final challenge

2252
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,400
How to make a better test

2253
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,400
For a smaller area

2254
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,400
Because what is it

2255
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,400
It's really a little bit difficult

2256
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,400
Because it's not that easy to control

2257
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,400
You have to make a big one

2258
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,400
A lot of phasing

2259
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,400
A lot of defects

2260
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,400
It's easy, but you have to do it

2261
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,400
It's a little bit difficult

2262
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,400
Do you have any other questions?

2263
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,400
Okay, let's thank Zong

2264
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,400
For bringing us a wonderful speech

2265
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,400
And a great Q&A

2266
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,400
Thank you

2267
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,400
Thank you

2268
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,400
If you have any questions

2269
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
If you are really interested in BCS

2270
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
Because my speech is not very good

2271
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,400
If you are interested

2272
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,400
You can come back to me

2273
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,400
I think

2274
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,400
It's a little bit difficult

2275
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,400
Because it's a little bit difficult

2276
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,400
If you are interested

2277
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,400
You can come back to me

2278
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,400
I think it makes me think a lot of questions

2279
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,400
I hope everyone

2280
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,400
If you are interested

2281
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,400
You can join this field

2282
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,400
You see so many people in front

2283
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
Cosmology

2284
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,400
Actually it's ok

2285
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,400
I will turn off the recording now
