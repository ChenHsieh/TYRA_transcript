00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's Chara Talk.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Wu Jiazhen,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
who is currently at Winstead University,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to share his research with us.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today's topic is

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
MicroBioEcology of Activated Carbon Block

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Point-of-Use Drinking Water Filters.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are several special terms here,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which he will introduce to us later.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Before we get started,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I would like to introduce Jiazhen's background.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Jiazhen is an Environmental Microbiologist.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He got his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Before he got his Ph.D.,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
he studied Public Health at NTU,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and his Master's Degree was Environmental Engineering.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Before that, he did research on tap water in Taiwan.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So it makes sense that he started to focus on this direction.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He is currently at the Institute of Environmental Health Science

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
at Winstead University, Detroit, Michigan.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The main topic he will share with us today is his research.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In addition to his research,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
of course, I believe that research is also one of your interests.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In addition to his research,

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jiazhen is also a pianist and a hiker.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you for the introduction.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Jiazhen just gave a very complete introduction.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
When I was at NTU,

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I did research on microorganisms.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When I entered the Institute of Environmental Engineering,

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I studied microorganisms in tap water.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because of these past experiences,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I started to read my Ph.D. at the University of Michigan in 2013.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I read a lot of books about the microorganisms in tap water.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will use Chinese and English to introduce my Ph.D. thesis.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The topic I want to talk about today is

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the study of biochemical and biological microorganisms in tap water.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The so-called activating carbon block point-of-view

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
drinking water filter is actually a very common filter

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that can be seen in the market.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This filter uses carbon dioxide to remove some chemicals.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In fact, from my past research on microorganisms in water

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
or in tap water,

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I gradually discovered that

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the changes in microorganisms in tap water

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and the chemical reaction between microorganisms and tap water

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
are very complicated and change a lot.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Since my background is not in the field of environmental engineering,

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will briefly introduce tap water.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Tap water enters the water supply system

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
through the water supply system.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This diagram shows that

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
in the water supply system,

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
there are various reactions in the process of

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
delivering tap water to various households

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
or buildings in large water pipes.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In fact, there are a variety of reactions

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
or various interactions in the process of delivering tap water.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For example, the bacteria may live in the liquid.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There may be competition between different bacteria,

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and they may grow more or less.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
At the same time,

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
they may also be inactivated by the disinfectant in the tap water.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So there will be growth and death.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There may also be absorption of

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
some particles in the tap water,

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
or absorption on the tap water pipe,

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and then form a biofilm.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This biofilm may also be re-returned to the tap water

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
through the purification of the tap water.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In fact, in our household,

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
if you open your chest,

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the water that flows out of the chest,

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and the other bacteria,

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
there is a lot of water in the tap water.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There may be more than 10,000 to more than 10 million bacteria per liter.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is a word in our topic just now,

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Point of Use.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It is simply the meaning of the word.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The so-called point of use.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We don't just look at the water quality after the tap water comes out.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We are looking at the water quality

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
through the tap water system.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We are looking at the water quality

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
through the tap water system.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It may be one day, it may be several days,

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
or it may be a few hours.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
At this time,

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
when it comes to our household,

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
our company, and our school,

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
after opening the tap,

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that place is called the point of use.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is the concentration when it first comes out.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There are tens of thousands of bacteria per liter.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There are tens of thousands of bacteria per liter.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It sounds terrible,

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but in fact, most of the bacteria are not necessarily harmful to the human body.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Traditionally,

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the so-called bacteria that are more concerned

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the so-called bacteria that are more concerned

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
are related to intestinal or feces pollution.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like intestinal fungus,

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
like intestinal fungus,

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
like Shigella,

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which is the most traditionally recognized bacteria

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
for decades.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So there are rules to regulate the concentration

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of more than one CFU per liter.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
of more than one CFU per liter.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The other type of opportunistic pathogen

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
of the disease

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
may not necessarily harm everyone.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
may not necessarily harm everyone.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Opportunistic means

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the population that is more sensitive.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
For example, the elderly,

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the people with chronic diseases,

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
or people who are addicted to alcohol.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For people like this,

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
if they encounter such a pathogen,

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
if they encounter such a pathogen,

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
they may get sick.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
These pathogens include

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
lupus,

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
leukemia,

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and mycobacteria.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because of the advancement of technology,

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
we slowly found that they can still be detected in the water.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,480
These pathogens may be

132
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,000
more than one CFU

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
or ten CFU

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
per liter,

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
in epidemic areas.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
...

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
for disinfectants

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and chemicals.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
...

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Third,

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
bacteria resistant bacteria.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
...

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
...

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
...

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
...

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
...

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
...

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
...

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
...

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
...

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
...

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
...

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
...

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
...

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
...

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
...

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
...

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
...

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
...

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
...

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
...

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
...

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
...

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
...

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
...

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
...

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
...

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
...

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
...

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
...

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
...

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
...

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
...

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
...

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
...

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
...

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
...

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
...

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
...

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
...

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
...

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
...

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
...

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
...

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
...

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
...

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
...

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
...

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
...

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
...

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
...

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
