00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, everyone. I'm Jason Hong.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm the host for today.

00:10.000 --> 00:24.000
Today, we're honored to have two postdocs from the Japanese Institute of理化學研究所, RIKEN.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
One is the founder of TAIRA, Ted Chang.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
The other is Xu Chengxuan.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
Ted Chang is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Emerging Sciences.

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
His research focuses on the interaction between light and light-emitting ions.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Chengxuan focuses on theory.

00:59.000 --> 01:16.000
His research focuses on the interaction between spin-orbital interaction and Latin geoliquid effects on nanostructure.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
We're honored to have them here today.

01:23.000 --> 01:43.000
Today's topic is 2-Dimensional Electron Gas, 2DEC, Electronic and Application.

01:43.000 --> 01:58.000
I'd like to ask Ted Chang to introduce 2-Dimensional Electron Gas.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Can you hear me?

02:13.000 --> 02:27.000
Most of the audience is muted.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
If you have any questions, please turn on the microphone.

02:33.000 --> 02:43.000
There's a line on the right side of the screen, which means you're muted.

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
You can also leave a comment in the chat box on the right.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
Hello, I'm Ted Chang.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
Today I'm going to talk about 2DEC.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
2DEC stands for 2-Dimensional Electron Gas.

03:09.000 --> 03:19.000
We use semiconductors to generate different heterostructure materials.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
We can also do some interesting experiments by adding some processes.

03:25.000 --> 03:48.000
Later on, Ted Chang will talk about how to use 2DEC to generate heterostructure materials.

03:48.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm going to talk about how to generate 2DEC.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
We're going to talk about how to generate quantum dots.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
In quantum dots, we can trap a single electron.

04:08.000 --> 04:19.000
In this experiment, we're going to measure the direction of polarization of light.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
The result is a single electron.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
We can also generate entangled photons.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
This is a technology that has been around for 20 years.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
We can generate entangled photons and spins.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Let's talk about 2DEC.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Why do we want to enter 2DEC?

04:53.000 --> 05:06.000
In fact, in 3D life, the phenomenon is different in 2D.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
This is a very special example.

05:09.000 --> 05:19.000
In 2D space, it is not possible for an animal to live in 2D space.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Why?

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Because this dog will be separated by its digestive tract.

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
Dogs in 2D space are not likely to exist in 2D space.

05:34.000 --> 05:44.000
Because the physical conditions in 2D space are different, there will be different phenomena.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
What method do we use to observe 2DEC?

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
Let's talk about how 2DEC is generated.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
We will also introduce some basic characteristics of 2DEC.

06:04.000 --> 06:20.000
If we have different semiconductor materials, which phenomenon is the most important to characterize the good or bad of these materials?

06:21.000 --> 06:35.000
From 2DEC, we will introduce how to control the production of electrons or even a single electron in the material.

06:35.000 --> 06:50.000
How does 2DEC interact with a single electron?

06:50.000 --> 07:08.000
This is a diagram of 3 different materials.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
The left bottom corner is the material of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
The band structure of these two materials is different.

07:20.000 --> 07:43.000
The band structure on the left is the material of gallium arsenide, and the band structure on the right is the material of aluminum gallium arsenide.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
When the two materials are stacked together, a quantum well is generated.

07:51.000 --> 08:06.000
In the middle of the quantum well, the Fermi energy, which occupies the highest electromagnetic field, can be adjusted.

08:06.000 --> 08:35.000
The material of gallium arsenide can move freely in the 2D space.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
At the same time, different materials can be used to make similar 2DEC.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
Later on, we will introduce gallium arsenide.

08:48.000 --> 08:58.000
In our lab, we are also working on silicon and silicon germanium, which are also heterostructures.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
In this material, we will focus on the characteristics of gallium arsenide.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
The main thing is that we hope that its mobility is basically the higher the better.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Mobility is also related to a lot of things.

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
Usually, the mean free path is very long, and the scheduling time is very short.

09:24.000 --> 09:44.000
In this material, we will focus on the phase coherence lab, which is the interaction between electrons.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
We hope that the interaction between electrons will be better and better.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Of course, it is different for different materials.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
But basically, our main concern is mobility, mean free path, and scheduling time.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
Gallium arsenide is a very mature technology.

10:03.000 --> 10:11.000
Now it can grow to tens of millions, which is no problem.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Of course, there are many limitations in other materials.

10:18.000 --> 10:27.000
The impurities in the middle of each layer may not match.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
So in this aspect, its mobility will be reduced.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
In contrast, its mean free path and scheduling time are not so good.

10:39.000 --> 11:05.000
Next, we will talk about how to use mature manufacturing technology to make special components from 2DEC.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
This picture looks very old.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Indeed, this is a paper published in 1996.

11:13.000 --> 11:26.000
It uses gallium arsenide with a similar structure.

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
So it has gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide, and gallium arsenide, which are different doping materials.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
It can add electrons up and down.

11:38.000 --> 11:50.000
So it has a dot in the middle, which is a 2D artificial atom.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Because its electrons can only be confined to this layer,

11:56.000 --> 12:05.000
we used to think that our electronic architecture has a lot of S, P, and D domain.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
But it is S, P, D, and L in three-dimensional space.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
But in 2D, its S, P, D, and L, its orbital angular number is different.

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
Because of the discovery of 2D artificial atom,

12:25.000 --> 12:46.000
we created a periodic table for 2D artificial atoms.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
The elements in this table are very interesting.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
It is named after the person who discovered this phenomenon.

12:56.000 --> 13:05.000
Our group, Tarucha, is in the upper left corner of the periodic table.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
There are many famous people in this table.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
This is one of the researchers of Mariana Fermi.

13:21.000 --> 13:29.000
In addition to using the H method to describe different elements,

13:29.000 --> 13:36.000
there is another method that is commonly used now.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
It is to put an electrode on it.

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
For example, in 1988, they started to put an electrode on 2D.

13:46.000 --> 13:57.000
The current from the left to the right is a quantized conductance.

13:57.000 --> 14:07.000
When passing through the channel, the wave function can only be confined to these directions.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
So the conductance is quantized.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
This is a picture of its side.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
When you apply voltage to the electrode below,

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
the lower the voltage, the narrower the channel below.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
At the same time, it also controls the height of the level.

14:29.000 --> 14:39.000
This is how it produces quantized conductance.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Sorry, sometimes it doesn't work.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Oh, yes, quantized conductance.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
Next, we will slowly enter the topic.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
Recently, everyone has been discussing quantum computing.

14:57.000 --> 15:04.000
How to use quantum dot or quantum confine in the direction of quantum,

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
and how to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
This paper was written by Chen Xuanhui's boss in 1998.

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
How to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.

15:26.000 --> 15:34.000
Basically, the concept is that when we apply voltage to the electrode above,

15:34.000 --> 15:45.000
there are some electrons below that can only stay in this area.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
This is because it is confined to one end, so it is in quantum dot.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
How to use quantum dot to produce quantized conductance.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
Apply different voltages to the gate in the middle,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
so that the interaction between electrons becomes stronger or weaker.

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
So that it has the effect of exchange.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Next, let's move on to my real experiment.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
This is our dilution fridge.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Our components are placed on a chip on the dilution fridge.

16:26.000 --> 16:39.000
The real size is about 1cm x 1cm.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
As long as you apply voltage to the electrode above,

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
you can control the production of quantum dot.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
For example, this is an SEM graph.

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
The quantum dot produced here is produced in the electrode confined here.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
Its size is about 100nm.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
In addition to producing double quantum dot,

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
the same device can also produce single quantum dot.

17:11.000 --> 17:18.000
When the voltage in the middle is not so high,

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
the whole space can let the electrons stay in the middle.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
In this place, we can measure its conductance.

17:31.000 --> 17:40.000
It is like a horizontal line.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
When the voltage in the middle increases,

17:44.000 --> 17:58.000
it produces a stability diagram.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Next, I will talk about how our experiment is going.

18:04.000 --> 18:14.000
The optical part is producing entangled photons in the left half of the graph.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
Entangled photons are basically two different nonlinear crystals.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
One is producing double quantum dot,

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
and the other is producing entangled photons.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
When we measure the polarization of the photon on one side,

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
we measure the spin of the electron on the other side.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Is the electron spinning up or down?

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
This is a work from five years ago.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
When a single electron is produced,

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
it is related to the direction of polarization of the photon.

19:00.000 --> 19:09.000
When you produce a circular polarization with different velocities,

19:09.000 --> 19:19.000
it produces different traces of electrons.

19:19.000 --> 19:28.000
Next, we will talk about how to use the irradiated light

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
to produce a single electron.

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
How do we measure the direction of the electron's spin?

19:37.000 --> 19:50.000
Next, we will measure the direction of the electron's spin from horizontal to spin up or vertical to spin down.

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
This is to use the electron and hole pair produced.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
We use the light hole instead of the heavy hole.

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
This method allows us to produce different spin directions from horizontal to vertical.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
How to do spin readout?

20:18.000 --> 20:28.000
We use a method called spin-to-charge conversion.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
We hope that the spin-up and spin-down are different.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
How do we do this?

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
We use a phenomenon called Pauli Spin Blockade.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
If you know the Pauli Exclusion Principle,

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
you will know that if the electron spins up or down on both sides,

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
it will not be able to move from the left to the right.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
This is our basic way of doing it.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
In the experiment, we let the quantum dot on the right have an electron.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
The blue star represents 0 and 1.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
0 and 1 represent the charge state of different quantum dots.

21:19.000 --> 21:30.000
When another electron is produced, it will enter 1 or 0.2.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
If the electron is produced in the opposite direction,

21:34.000 --> 21:41.000
it will spin left and right.

21:41.000 --> 21:48.000
When the electron is produced in the opposite direction,

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
it will spin left and right.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
When the electron is produced in the opposite direction,

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
it will spin left and right.

22:09.000 --> 22:18.000
This is how we measure the direction of single spin.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
If it is in a different direction of spin,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
its trace will be different.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
This graph also describes the phenomenon I just described.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
How do we produce an entangled photon?

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
This is a very mature technology.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Because the quantum dot moves,

22:50.000 --> 23:00.000
the light in the two circles will move in the opposite direction.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
The light in the two circles will move in the opposite direction.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
If you measure the polarization of the light in the two circles,

23:12.000 --> 23:21.000
If you measure the polarization of the light in the two circles,

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
it will be an entangled state.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
it will be an entangled state.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
Next, we measure the light.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
Next, we measure the light.

23:39.000 --> 23:47.000
Next, we measure the light.

23:47.000 --> 23:59.000
If the light receives the two signals at the same time,

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
it means that we have an entangled photon and an entangled spin.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
This is the result of our experiment last year.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
It produces an entangled photon and an entangled spin.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
It produces an entangled photon and an entangled spin.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
This is the end of the main experiment.

24:26.000 --> 24:35.000
Here I explain how 2D Electron GANs is formed.

24:35.000 --> 24:44.000
Here I explain how 2D Electron GANs is formed.

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
Usually, the quantum dot is produced differently.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
Some products are self-assembled quantum dots,

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
because the structure of the golden frame

24:59.000 --> 25:05.000
has a defect, and this defect becomes a quantum dot.

25:05.000 --> 25:13.000
Compared to us, we use predetermined electrons

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
to apply different voltages to produce a single dot, a double dot.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
So these are very controllable things.

25:22.000 --> 25:31.000
Next, I will talk about how to measure the direction of the single electron.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
We will also talk about how to change the direction of the light

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
from a different bias to a different direction of the electron.

25:42.000 --> 25:49.000
Finally, we will talk about how to use the entangled photon

25:49.000 --> 25:56.000
to produce different directions of the electron,

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
and how to produce entangled photons and spin pairs.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
That's all for today.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
Our lab is the Quantum Functional System Research Group

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
at the Institute of Physics and Chemistry.

26:17.000 --> 26:25.000
Our main PI is Harucha,

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
and we have other partners,

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
such as Chenxuan and Loss,

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
and OIWA, a group from Osaka University.

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
Our wafers are provided by a German school and organization.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
That's all for today.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Thank you.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Thank you, Ted, for the wonderful talk.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
If you have any questions,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
please feel free to ask.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
If not, I will ask a question.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
You mentioned that mobility is very important.

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
Where does mobility and phase coherence time affect quantum computing?

27:34.000 --> 27:40.000
Why are these properties important?

27:47.000 --> 27:54.000
Phase coherence time limits the size of the quantum dot.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
The phase coherence length and mean free path of a quantum dot

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
can reach tens of microns.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
The requirements for the process are less than 1 micron.

28:13.000 --> 28:21.000
Silicon is much smaller, about 10 times smaller.

28:22.000 --> 28:30.000
Therefore, it is more difficult for us to experiment or process.

28:30.000 --> 28:38.000
The size of the quantum dot must be at least 100 nanometers or less.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
What we are doing now is to control the electron in this area.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
If there are still some phenomena in this area,

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
this is not ideal.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
Basically, mobility, mean free path, and phase coherence length

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
affect the size of the component process.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
Of course, there are different difficulties.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
For example, if my SEM graph shows that

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
the size of a dot is about 200 to 300 nanometers.

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
So a dot is about 200 nanometers or less.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
Silicon is super difficult to make, so it will be more difficult.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
But the Galien Arsenide you show has a coherence length of 40 microns.

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
So even if you make it less than 40 microns,

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
you can still make it.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
It doesn't matter if it's less than 1 micron.

30:04.000 --> 30:10.000
1 micron is already very easy to make.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
Basically, photolithography can be done.

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
Do you have any questions?

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
We are very informal, so you can ask as many questions as possible.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.000
Hello, can you hear me?

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
Can you hear me?

30:40.000 --> 30:48.000
I have a question.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
Do you know how long the coherence time can be less?

30:56.000 --> 31:04.000
What is the relaxation time after entanglement?

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
For electrons, it's very small.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
Because it's in the Galien Arsenide, it's about 100 nanoseconds.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
I see.

31:22.000 --> 31:30.000
So it's still limited by the time of entanglement.

31:30.000 --> 31:38.000
Basically, in the Galien Arsenide, there are many different nucleons.

31:38.000 --> 31:46.000
These nucleons will interact with electrons.

31:46.000 --> 31:54.000
So it can be about a few hundred nanoseconds.

31:54.000 --> 32:02.000
In the Galien Arsenide, it's very short.

32:02.000 --> 32:10.000
But in silicon, it's about 20 milliseconds.

32:10.000 --> 32:18.000
Because silicon can be purified,

32:18.000 --> 32:26.000
silicon can be purified, and silicon can be purified.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
Thank you.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
Any other questions?

32:38.000 --> 32:46.000
If not, let's invite Chenxuan to give the next speech.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
Okay, thank you.

32:52.000 --> 33:02.000
Hello, everyone.

33:02.000 --> 33:08.000
Can you see my slides now?

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Yes.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
Thank you, Jason.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
Thank you, Ted, for the invitation.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
My name is Chenxuan Xu.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.

33:30.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
I'm going to talk about 2DEC electronics and applications.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
In my research, I focus on spin-orbital coupling.

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
So I'll start by introducing spin-orbital coupling in nanostructure.

33:56.000 --> 34:04.000
Then I'll talk about why we're interested in very strong spin-orbital coupling.

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
Then I'll talk about why we're interested in very strong spin-orbital coupling.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
This is our recent theoretical research.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
When you have a very strong spin-orbital coupling in nanowire,

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
what will happen to your charge transport, current, or inductance?

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
Okay, let's start our introduction.

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
In nanostructure, we usually have inversion symmetry breaking.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
These inversion symmetry breaking are equivalent to a circuit.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
When electrons move in these inversion symmetry breaking,

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
there is a magnetic field in its inversion symmetry breaking.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
This magnetic field, of course, will be coupled with its spin coupling.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
In our experimental inversion symmetry breaking,

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
it looks like its spin and momentum will be coupled.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Because momentum is related to its orbital motion,

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
we call this coupling spin-orbital coupling.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
In nanostructure, there are mainly two kinds of symmetry breaking.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
The first one is what Ted just introduced.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
Because we're going to form two decks, we'll have some heterostructure.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
So in the z-direction, there's a magnetic field.

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
This magnetic field will cause this spin-orbital coupling.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Then we call it rush-button coupling.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
In addition to this structure,

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
our material is usually made up of 3-5 sets of semiconductors.

35:42.000 --> 35:48.000
So in its crystal, there's usually inversion symmetry breaking.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
This inversion symmetry breaking will give us another phase.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
We call it Dresselhaus turn.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
I'll give you two examples.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
What kind of effect does this coupling have in nanostructure?

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
One of the effects is that

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
when we continue to confine this two-deck to a dot,

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
which is one of the applications Ted just talked about.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
Usually, after we form a common dot,

36:20.000 --> 36:26.000
if we want to do some further spin qubits experiments,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
we usually add a magnetic field.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
We found that if you have a magnetic field

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
coupled with spin-orbital coupling,

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
you'll change the G-factor in the dot.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
The G-factor is important here

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
because it affects Zeeman splitting.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Of course, it affects the nature of the dot electron.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
So we have a paper in our group

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
discussing this nature.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
That's the effect.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
The second example is related to the topic I'm going to talk about today.

37:02.000 --> 37:08.000
If your two-deck later forms a wire,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
usually your wire won't have...

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
your cross-section won't be zero.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
So you'll have some finite width.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
This is the so-called quasi-1D.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
This is what I call quasi-1D.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
In this case, we found that

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
spin-orbital coupling will form some

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
bend-distortion properties.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
I'm going to talk a little bit more about this.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
First of all, in a common experiment,

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
we'll add some magnetic fields.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
So the situation I'm going to discuss next,

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
the experiment is that

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
the launch button is far greater than the tracer host.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
So I'll just look at the launch button next.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
In the case of quasi-1D,

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
we know that there will be kinetic energy

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
along the direction of the wire.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
So that's the term.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
In the y-direction, I'll have some confinement.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
I can take this part of the energy spectrum quantized.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
So it's equivalent to this kind of energy splitting.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
So this is my sub-bend term.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
The launch button will result in

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
the mixing of these two parts.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I just mentioned that

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
the launch button spin-orbital coupling

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
can have these two terms.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Let's look at the first term,

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
which is the term related to Kx.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
It's related to the momentum along the wire.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
So the effect of this term is that

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
in the energy spectrum,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
it splits the quadratic dispersion

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
of the upper and lower order.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
So there's this shift.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
If I add the second term of

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
the launch button spin-orbital coupling,

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
this term will couple these two states

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
in this little green circle.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
So it splits the different sub-bends

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
with the opposite spin-orbital coupling.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
If I add these two terms,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
I'll find that the energy spectrum

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
of my quantum wire will be distorted.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
This means that

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
if I have a Fermi energy here,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
we'll find that the energy spectrum

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
of branch A and branch B,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
which is the red and blue energy spectrum,

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
the Fermi velocity will be different.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
So I call this bend-distortion.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
This is another effect of

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
the launch button spin-orbital coupling.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
Another one is that it may mix

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the upper and lower order.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
Mainly because of the spin-orbital coupling,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
your spin is no longer a good quantum number.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
We have some simple calculations here.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
The left side is the energy spectrum.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
If I have a chemical potential,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
assuming that the chemical potential

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
is slowly tuned from the bottom to the top,

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
the graph on the right is equivalent to

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
from left to right.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
We're calculating the spin expectation value

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
of these four different states.

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
We'll find that because of the spin-orbital coupling,

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
the spin will change with the chemical potential.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
This is one effect.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
The second effect is what I just said.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Because these two energy bands

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
have different velocities,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
we can also calculate their velocities

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
and find that they are also related to the chemical potential.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
Here is a brief introduction

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
of these effects.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Now, I'd like to go back to the beginning

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
and ask why we're interested in

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
spin-orbital coupling.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
This question is equivalent to asking

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
why spin-orbital coupling is so important.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Is it because it can be eaten?

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
If you're in Kalucha's group,

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
you'll find that they can make

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
a double nanowire cake.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
If you're a good friend of their group,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
you can eat this delicious double nanowire cake.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
But apart from being edible,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
the most important thing for us is

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
that if you have spin-orbital coupling,

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
you can use it to achieve Majorna bond states.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
This is a relatively popular material

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
in the field of spin-orbital coupling.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Next, I'd like to introduce

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
what Majorna bond states are.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
This is more than 80 years ago.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Majorana was an Italian physicist.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
He proposed that

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
in the Dirac equation,

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
there is a real solution.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
The solution is called Majorna fermions.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
They are their own antimatter.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
The reason why we're interested in

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
condensers and solid-state physics

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
is because we later found that

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Majorna fermions may not be able to

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
or we may not be able to

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
verify that they are elementary particles.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
But they may be able to be realized

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
in solid-state physics,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
especially in the last 10 years.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
The paper by Ulrich and Dasama

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
tells you that

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
if you want to achieve Majorna fermions,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
you only need some easy-to-do setups.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
You just need some spin-orbital nanowires

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
to achieve Majorna bond states.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
Because of the appearance of these two papers,

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
people started to notice

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
that we may be able to achieve Majorna bond states.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
Of course, Majorna bond states

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
are very popular.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
The other reason is that

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
they are thought to provide

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
some topological quantum computation.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
So you can use them to do quantum computing.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
This is one of the reasons

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
why people are interested in them.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
Because of this nature,

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
you may be able to do quantum computation.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
People want to know

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
if they can really do it.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
Let me introduce the most

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
well-known or

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
carefully studied setup,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
that is, using single-wire.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
As I said, if you convert an electron

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
into a single-wire,

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
and if the material has a strong spin-orbital coupling,

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
for example,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
you can use indium arsenide or indium montmorillonide.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
As you know,

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
these materials have a strong spin-orbital coupling.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
If you have these materials,

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
and you add some magnetic field

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
along the direction of the wire,

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
basically,

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
you can have this effect.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
If you have large-spin-orbital coupling,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
as I said,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
the dispersion will be shifted.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
If you add another magnetic field,

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
it will open a Zeeman gap

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
at the zero-momentum point.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
If your chemical potential

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
is fine-tuned to this area,

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
you will have helical modes.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
Helical modes are the electrons

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
on the right and on the left

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
with different spin,

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
which is called helical modes.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
If you put such a wire

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
on a superconductor,

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
you will find that

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
at the zero-momentum point,

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
the system gap is determined by two parameters.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
One is the pairing gap,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
and the other is the Zeeman gap.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
This means that you have two gap openings

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
competing against each other.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Both gaps want to open,

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
but their opening signs are opposite.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
So the system gap

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
means that

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
if I put my wire on the superconductor,

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
my pairing gap will be fixed.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
If I slowly open my magnetic field,

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
the system gap,

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
the gap of the entire energy spectrum,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
will shrink,

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
and it will be closed at a certain point.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
If I continue to open my magnetic field,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
it will be reopened.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Here we find a topological phase transition.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
In this area on the right,

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
we find that the band is inversed.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Because of this band inversion,

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
we find that in this area,

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
you can achieve Majorna bond state.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
You can see that

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
the elements needed here

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
sound quite simple.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
As long as you have a magnetic field,

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
a superconductor,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
and strong enough spin-over coupling,

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
you can achieve Majorna bond state.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
It sounds quite convenient,

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
so we put a lot of effort

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
into studying this setup.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
But there is a difficulty.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
Because you need a magnetic field,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
the magnetic field tends to disrupt the superconductor.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
In other words,

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
your entire gap is usually affected by the magnetic field.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
In other words,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
your Majorna bond state

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
is usually in the middle of the gap.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
The smaller the gap,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
the weaker the protection.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
So you don't need a magnetic field.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
This makes people,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
especially those who do theoretical research,

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
wonder if there are other mechanisms.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
As mentioned earlier,

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
we need the so-called gap opening

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
to open the gap

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
and achieve Majorna bond state.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
If we look at it the other way around,

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
if we look at it the other way around,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
before the pairing gap,

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
my energy spectrum

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
is equivalent to

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
a spin-selected gap in my energy spectrum.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
That is, the gap opening

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
between the upper and lower branches

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
is different in the momentum space.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Is it possible

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
to have a spin-selected gap?

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
People later found out that

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
if you have a wire

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
and feel the rotating magnetic field,

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
you can achieve a spin-selected gap.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
you can achieve a spin-selected gap.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
People later found out that

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
in the case of a single-wire,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
the conduction electron has a so-called RKKY coupling.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
This RKKY coupling

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
can achieve a very special spin order.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
can achieve a very special spin order.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
This spin will automatically

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
generate a rotating order.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
This order can be used to achieve

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
the very special gap we just mentioned.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
That is, if you have this RKKY system,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
That is, if you have this RKKY system,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
you automatically have a spin-off coupling.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
you automatically have a spin-off coupling.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
That is, you have a synthetic spin-off coupling.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
That is, you have a synthetic spin-off coupling.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
If you put such a system on the super island,

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
you will have different competing mechanisms.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
you will have different competing mechanisms.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
You can have band-inversion

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
and you can achieve Myrna-Brown state.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
Our group also used a similar mechanism a while ago.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Our group also used a similar mechanism a while ago.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
We found that if you use carbon-13,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
which is different from the usual carbon-12,

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
which is different from the usual carbon-12,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
it will have nuclear spin.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
If you use carbon-13 nanotube,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
you will find that it will automatically generate this helix.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
If you put this nanotube on the super island,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
you can achieve Myrna-Brown state.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
Of course, there may also be different setups.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
Of course, there may also be different setups.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
What we were doing a while ago was using higher-order TI.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
What we were doing a while ago was using higher-order TI.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
In this case, your material will have this so-called

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
gapless-hinged state.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
We found that if you put the super conductor on the material,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
We found that if you put the super conductor on the material,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
you can achieve two different pairings.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
One is the so-called non-local pairing,

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
and the other is the local pairing.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
You can achieve Myrna-Brown state

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
because of the competition between these two different pairings.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
Today's topic is more related to

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
the so-called double nanowire setup.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
Today's topic is more related to

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
the so-called double nanowire setup.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
You put two nanowires on the super conductor.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
You put two nanowires on the super conductor.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
There are two ways for the cooper pair to enter the nanowire.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
You can enter the same nanowire,

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
which is called local pairing.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
You can also enter different nanowires.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
Theoretically, you will find that

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
if you have non-local pairing greater than local pairing,

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
you can also achieve Myrna-Brown state.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
This can explain our motivation.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
This can explain our motivation.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Basically, we want to know

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
that we can have some spin-octal coupling nanowires

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
that we want to know that we can have some spin-octal coupling nanowires

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
that we can try to put on the super conductor.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
How do we achieve this condition,

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
that is, non-local pairing greater than local pairing?

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
This is another theoretical study.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
This is another theoretical study.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
If your electronic interaction is strong enough,

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
you are likely to achieve this condition.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
The reason is that the electronic interaction here is the coolant.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
The reason is that the electronic interaction here is the coolant.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
So if your coolant is very strong,

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
it will try to split your cooper pair into different wires.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
So if your coolant interaction is strong enough,

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
your non-local pairing will be greater than the local pairing.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
your non-local pairing will be greater than the local pairing.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
Before trying to achieve these topological states,

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
Before trying to achieve these topological states,

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
we would like to know that how could we reach

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
strong electronic interaction.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
Normal, the so-called

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
wired electronic interaction

53:10.000 --> 53:12.880
is described with the Tomonaga-Latinger

53:12.880 --> 53:15.880
or Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid.

53:15.880 --> 53:18.880
In describing its model,

53:18.880 --> 53:21.880
we will have a parameter called Gc.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.880
So the point is that we want to know

53:24.880 --> 53:27.880
how much Gc we can reach.

53:27.880 --> 53:30.880
Let's review first.

53:30.880 --> 53:33.880
If there is no spin-over coupling,

53:33.880 --> 53:36.880
how do we determine the value of Gc in practice?

53:36.880 --> 53:39.880
Here I simply write this Hamiltonian.

53:39.880 --> 53:42.880
If there is no spin-over coupling,

53:42.880 --> 53:45.880
the so-called Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid

53:45.880 --> 53:48.880
will look like this.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.880
There will be some bosonic fields

53:51.880 --> 53:54.880
to describe the physics of low energy.

53:54.880 --> 53:57.880
The most important thing is this Gnu.

53:57.880 --> 54:00.880
Gnu is C or S,

54:00.880 --> 54:03.880
which is the charge or spin sector.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.880
The most important thing is that because of the coolant interaction,

54:06.880 --> 54:09.880
there is no spin-over coupling.

54:09.880 --> 54:12.880
The smaller the Gc, the stronger the spin-over coupling.

54:12.880 --> 54:15.880
So we want to know

54:15.880 --> 54:18.880
the value of Gc in this material.

54:18.880 --> 54:21.880
How do we know?

54:21.880 --> 54:24.880
As you can see in the document,

54:24.880 --> 54:27.880
if you have a Tomonaga-Latinger Liquid,

54:27.880 --> 54:30.880
your IV curve will look like this.

54:30.880 --> 54:33.880
This IV curve

54:33.880 --> 54:36.880
has a so-called universal scaling behavior.

54:36.880 --> 54:39.880
What does it mean?

54:39.880 --> 54:42.880
If you divide both sides

54:42.880 --> 54:45.880
by the power load of the temperature,

54:45.880 --> 54:48.880
you will find that the right side

54:48.880 --> 54:51.880
is only related to V divided by T.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.880
This V is the bias voltage,

54:54.880 --> 54:57.880
and T is the temperature.

54:57.880 --> 55:00.880
In other words, if you draw this picture,

55:00.880 --> 55:03.880
you will find that all the bias and all the temperature

55:03.880 --> 55:06.880
data points are all concentrated on the same line.

55:06.880 --> 55:09.880
This is called universal scaling.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.880
Because this scaling is related to this α,

55:12.880 --> 55:15.880
and this α is related to this Gc,

55:15.880 --> 55:18.880
so if you can fit this data,

55:18.880 --> 55:21.880
you can find out how much Gc should be.

55:21.880 --> 55:24.880
In this way, you can know

55:24.880 --> 55:27.880
how strong the interaction of electrons in the guide line is.

55:28.880 --> 55:31.880
Here's an example.

55:31.880 --> 55:34.880
Tarucha's group

55:34.880 --> 55:37.880
uses indium arsenide as a wire.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.880
They first get a two-deck wafer,

55:40.880 --> 55:43.880
and then continue to convert it into a wire.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.880
This is what Ted mentioned earlier.

55:46.880 --> 55:49.880
If you have these wires,

55:49.880 --> 55:52.880
they continue to measure this IV curve

55:52.880 --> 55:55.880
with the current to the bias voltage.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.880
Different colors represent different temperatures,

55:59.880 --> 56:02.880
and you find that the low data is like this.

56:02.880 --> 56:05.880
But you can rescale it.

56:05.880 --> 56:08.880
After rescaling, you will find that all the data points

56:08.880 --> 56:11.880
are concentrated on this line.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.880
So this tells us that there really is

56:14.880 --> 56:17.880
the phenomenon of the so-called Tomonaga-Rattinger liquid in this guide line.

56:17.880 --> 56:20.880
You can get this α from this fitting.

56:20.880 --> 56:23.880
They continue to tune

56:24.880 --> 56:27.880
different top gate voltages.

56:27.880 --> 56:30.880
That is, it can adjust the charge density in the guide line.

56:30.880 --> 56:33.880
You find different densities.

56:33.880 --> 56:36.880
The low data you get is like this.

56:36.880 --> 56:39.880
Then you can go to fit

56:39.880 --> 56:42.880
and find the phenomenon of universal scaling.

56:42.880 --> 56:45.880
Their data is very beautiful.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.880
In other words,

56:48.880 --> 56:51.880
not only do you know that

56:51.880 --> 56:54.880
there is universal scaling in this line,

56:54.880 --> 56:57.880
there is Tomonaga-Rattinger liquid,

56:57.880 --> 57:00.880
you also know that you can tune

57:00.880 --> 57:03.880
the strength of the electron interaction.

57:03.880 --> 57:06.880
Here is the value of their fit α

57:06.880 --> 57:09.880
and the top gate voltage.

57:09.880 --> 57:12.880
So the first conclusion here is that

57:12.880 --> 57:15.880
you can have a tunable electron interaction.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.880
The second is that your α

57:18.880 --> 57:21.880
is about 2.5.

57:21.880 --> 57:24.880
How do we know

57:24.880 --> 57:27.880
what the value is when it is converted to Gc?

57:27.880 --> 57:30.880
The most important question here is

57:30.880 --> 57:33.880
because we know that the spin-over coupling of indium arsenide is very strong.

57:33.880 --> 57:36.880
What we found in the file before

57:36.880 --> 57:39.880
is that there is no spin-over coupling formula.

57:39.880 --> 57:42.880
So we want to know that if you add spin-over coupling,

57:42.880 --> 57:45.880
this formula will be changed.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.880
So how do we know

57:48.880 --> 57:51.880
what our real Gc is?

57:51.880 --> 57:54.880
So this brings us to our research this time.

57:54.880 --> 57:57.880
Because of the time,

57:57.880 --> 58:00.880
I will briefly introduce it.

58:00.880 --> 58:03.880
In the case of Bostonization,

58:03.880 --> 58:06.880
the introduction mentioned that

58:06.880 --> 58:09.880
you have the phenomenon of band distortion,

58:09.880 --> 58:12.880
which is ΔV.

58:12.880 --> 58:15.880
If you have a Hamiltonian,

58:15.880 --> 58:18.880
it will produce a new term.

58:18.880 --> 58:21.880
This new term is quadratic,

58:21.880 --> 58:24.880
so you can still diagonalize it.

58:24.880 --> 58:27.880
Then you can get the full Hamiltonian.

58:27.880 --> 58:30.880
Because this full Hamiltonian

58:30.880 --> 58:33.880
can still be directly solved,

58:33.880 --> 58:36.880
we can still use it to calculate

58:36.880 --> 58:39.880
our current or inductance.

58:40.880 --> 58:43.880
Then we will consider two extremes.

58:43.880 --> 58:46.880
That is, impurity,

58:46.880 --> 58:49.880
that is, there will be different impurities in this inductance.

58:49.880 --> 58:52.880
These impurities will cause

58:52.880 --> 58:55.880
your electron to backscatter.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.880
So this will affect your current or inductance.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.880
We consider two extremes.

59:01.880 --> 59:04.880
One is when this impurity is very strong.

59:04.880 --> 59:07.880
If it is very strong,

59:07.880 --> 59:10.880
there will be a tunnel barrier.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.880
Then we find that if your tunnel barrier

59:13.880 --> 59:16.880
is in the end of the inductance and the middle of the inductance,

59:16.880 --> 59:19.880
you will have different scaling exponents.

59:19.880 --> 59:22.880
So in these two different situations,

59:22.880 --> 59:25.880
we find that

59:25.880 --> 59:28.880
you can still get a similar form,

59:28.880 --> 59:31.880
which is this IV curve.

59:31.880 --> 59:34.880
It looks the same as the formula

59:35.880 --> 59:38.880
The only difference is that this α will be changed.

59:38.880 --> 59:41.880
Then we find that this α will be related to

59:41.880 --> 59:44.880
where your impurity is.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.880
Then it is also related to the bend distortion

59:47.880 --> 59:50.880
caused by spin-orbital coupling.

59:50.880 --> 59:53.880
This is its formula.

59:53.880 --> 59:56.880
Let's summarize the results in this picture.

59:56.880 --> 59:59.880
Let's summarize the results in this picture.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.880
In this picture,

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.880
I first draw the whole exponent

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.880
without spin-orbital coupling.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.880
It looks like this.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.880
That is to say, the stronger your electromagnetic interaction force,

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.880
that is, Gc is close to zero,

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.880
the greater your exponent.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.880
On the contrary, if Gc is 1,

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.880
that is, if there is no electromagnetic interaction force,

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.880
your α will become zero.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.880
This is the effect of spin-orbital coupling.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.880
We find that it affects

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.880
the strong electromagnetic interaction force.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.880
In fact, this effect is very small

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.880
because it is very small compared to the original exponent.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.880
That is to say, if there is a strong electromagnetic interaction force

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.880
in your導線,

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.880
you don't have to worry about whether spin-orbital coupling is strong or not.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.880
Because it doesn't really affect

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.880
the opposite area.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.880
If your electromagnetic interaction force is weak,

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.880
you will indeed see some changes.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.880
We found that the changes here are negative.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.880
That is to say, your exponent looks

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.880
smaller than it was without spin-orbital coupling.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.880
So these features tell us

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.880
that when your experiment has measured

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.880
that your α is quite high value,

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.880
it can be said that your electron-electron

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.880
display is very strong.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.880
This is our main conclusion.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.880
Of course, we just said that we can consider different limits.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.880
Your impurity can be very strong.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.880
This is the conclusion we just got.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.880
Your impurity can also be very weak.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.880
If it is very weak, we are not tunnel barrier.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.880
In this case, we consider a lot of

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.880
weak impurities.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.880
Then we get a similar formula.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.880
The difference is that the exponent will be different.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.880
We found that if we take this exponent

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.880
to draw this picture,

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.880
we will find that the big difference

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.880
is that the exponent will only go to 1 at most.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.880
That is, it will be limited between 0 and 1.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.880
So the 2.5 we saw in the experiment

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.880
cannot be explained by this weak impurity.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.880
So we can rule it out.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.880
So we know that the exponent we saw in the experiment

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.880
is 2.5 because

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.880
there are some very strong impurities in the導線.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.880
So we can get our conclusion here.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.880
So let's make a summary here.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.880
First, what we said in the introduction

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.880
is that if you have a導線

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.880
and you have a very strong spin-over coupling,

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.880
you can use it to achieve some

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.880
topological states.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.880
The second point is that

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.880
our research shows that

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.880
you can still use the IV curve to measure the導線.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.880
From here, you can deduce

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.880
how strong the electromagnetic interaction force

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.880
in the導線 is.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.880
Our analysis shows that

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.880
the IV curve in the experiment

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.880
of indium arsenide

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.880
allows us to deduce that Gc is about 0.2.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.880
So this means that the spin-over coupling

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.880
in the導線 is very strong.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.880
We know that indium arsenide

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.880
has a very strong spin-over coupling.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.880
Now we know that it can achieve

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.880
a very strong electromagnetic interaction force.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.880
So if you add these two factors together,

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.880
it tells us that indium arsenide

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.880
can be used to achieve Majorna bond state.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.880
Then you don't need to use magnetic field

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.880
to achieve Majorna bond state.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.880
This is my speech today.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.880
I'll pause here now

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.880
to see if you have any questions.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.880
Do you have any questions?

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.880
Let me ask you a question first.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.880
When you talk about α,

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.880
is it the gate voltage

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.880
of the conductance

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.880
or the source voltage?

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.880
Is it the gate voltage

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.880
or the source voltage?

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.880
Is that right?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.880
Yes, the V in the IV curve

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.880
is the source voltage.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.880
Can you explain a little bit?

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.880
Is there a more straightforward idea?

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.880
When α is equal to 0,

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.880
does it mean that this is a straight line?

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.880
What does α equal to 0 mean?

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.880
0 is the value of the current

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.880
in this IV curve.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.880
Is it a straight line?

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.880
Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.880
Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.880
Yes, because it doesn't have a scale 0.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.880
I think this is understandable.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.880
When there is no electron-electron interaction,

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.880
you are a little bit like...

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.880
If you are an ohmic contact,

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.880
If you are an ohmic contact,

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.880
you should get an ohmic line.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.880
you should get an ohmic line.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.880
When there is electron-electron interaction,

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.880
what does α mean?

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.880
When your source current is high,

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.880
When your source current is high,

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.880
you will get more current.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.880
When your source current is high,

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.880
you will get more current.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.880
Let me see if there is a similar formula.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.880
Let me see if there is a similar formula.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.880
You can think like this.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.880
Maybe I can use this.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.880
Is there a simpler physical image?

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.880
We can think like this.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.880
When you have an impurity at a point,

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.880
When you have an impurity at a point,

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.880
we say this is a strong impurity.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.880
It means that your impurity is very strong,

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.880
so your conduction channel is interrupted.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.880
so your conduction channel is interrupted.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.880
So when you want to have current,

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.880
you have to pass this tunneling.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.880
So you will have current.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.880
This tunneling is equivalent to

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.880
density of states.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.880
There will be density of states

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.880
in your conduction channel or lead.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.880
When you have a strong interaction force,

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.880
when α is stronger,

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.880
it means that your density of states will be suppressed.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.880
Because your density of states

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.880
can be thought of as the α-quantity of epsilon.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.880
It is also a power law.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.880
What is epsilon?

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.880
Epsilon is energy.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.880
So your density of states will be written as the rho of epsilon.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.880
So it is equivalent to

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.880
how many density of states you have

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.880
near the Fermi energy.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.880
If there is no interaction,

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.880
this α is 0,

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.880
which means that its density of states is constant.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.880
Because it is constant.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.880
So you will have some density of states

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.880
to allow you to tunnel.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.880
When your interaction force is getting stronger and stronger,

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.880
α will get bigger and bigger,

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.880
which means that the density of states

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.880
near the Fermi level will be suppressed.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.880
Because the α-quantity of epsilon,

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.880
which means that epsilon is getting closer to 0,

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.880
its density of states will be getting smaller and smaller.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.880
Because of this,

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.880
if you want to tunnel into

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.880
the liquid state,

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.880
it will be more and more impossible.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.880
You can think of it this way.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.880
So you need a higher voltage

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.880
to generate a certain current.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.880
Yes, you can say that.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.880
Wait, what about the experiment?

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.880
Did I read it wrong?

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.880
Ok, I think I understand what you mean.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.880
When your voltage is high,

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.880
your differential conductance

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.880
will increase.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.880
Yes, it will increase.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.880
Ok, I understand.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.880
So,

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.880
I think I wrote differential conductance

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.880
at the end.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.880
Here, here.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.880
Ok, so this is the definition of α.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.880
Yes.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.880
So the higher your V,

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.880
the higher your differential conductance.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.880
Of course, if you have a linear response region,

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.880
your voltage will be lower.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.880
Your power load is determined by the temperature.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.880
Yes.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.880
Does anyone have any questions?

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.880
Ok.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.880
If there are no further questions,

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.880
I will turn off the recording.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.880
You can continue to discuss

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.880
in the conference room.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.880
Let's turn on the microphone

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.880
and give a warm round of applause

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.880
to the speakers.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.880
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.880
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.880
Are you ready?

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.880
Please turn on your microphone

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.880
so that the speakers can hear you.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.880
Thank you.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.880
Thank you for your speech.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.880
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.880
I will turn off the recording.
