0	18000	Welcome everyone to today's Terra Talk, we are very honored to invite our speaker, Mr. Huang Shengfeng, to tell us about today's topic, Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.
18000	27000	I am very happy, because we have a long time in fact, there are no humanities or social science-related speeches.
27000	36000	Today, it is easy to invite Mr. Shengfeng, and Mr. Shengfeng is now in Edinburgh, he is 12 o'clock in the middle of the night to speak for everyone, so thank him very much.
37000	50000	First, let me introduce the background of Shengfeng. Shengfeng is the founder of Taipeng International Law, the founder of the Taiwan Voter Alliance.
50000	70000	He previously studied law at Taipei University and the Law Department of Taipei University, and then studied international law at the University of London, and now studies international law at Edinburgh University.
70000	80000	He is going to talk to us about the topic of Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.
80000	93000	A small reminder, if you don't turn on the microphone, you can't hear the applause, so let's turn on the microphone together, and thank Shengfeng for bringing us today's speech.
100000	112000	Hello everyone, I am Huang Shengfeng. Today I am very happy to have this opportunity to share with you some of the results of my research so far.
112000	120000	My research topic is Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.
120000	134000	At the beginning of the speech, I would like to share a sentence with everyone. This is what Albus Dumbledore said in Harry Potter.
134000	138000	Sometimes we must choose between what is right and what is easy.
164000	177000	In the end, it created today's situation. When we want to solve some problems in the future, we must continue to face many choices.
177000	188000	I don't know if the Taiwanese will choose the right choice or the simple and easy choice. I think this may determine our future.
188000	196000	At the beginning of this speech, I hope everyone can keep this sentence in mind.
196000	205000	Later, when I talk about the content, you can take this sentence out from time to time and think about it.
205000	215000	At that time, what did the Taiwanese think or what choices did the Taiwanese make in the end? What should we do in the future?
215000	220000	There are three main topics I want to share today. The first is the background knowledge of international law.
220000	226000	The second is the past and present of international law. The last is the future.
226000	240000	The background knowledge of international law is because most of the people who come to listen to my presentation today are not legal background.
241000	248000	So they may not know much about this aspect. I want to do some basic background explanation first.
248000	253000	Then I will start to talk about our internal topics.
253000	257000	First of all, we need to understand what international law is.
257000	266000	International law is the basic rule of law between political entities.
266000	269000	What is the political entity on international law?
269000	275000	Basically, it includes the so-called sovereign state.
275000	283000	The second is the so-called international organization, such as the United Nations, WHO, and WTO.
283000	285000	These are also political entities on international law.
285000	291000	The other is the implementation of autonomous units, such as Taiwan or Somaliland.
291000	298000	I put Taiwan in the implementation of autonomous units, not in the country.
298000	312000	This means that at least so far, under the definition of international law, Taiwan has not yet been recognized as a sovereign state.
312000	314000	Of course, everyone may have different ideas.
314000	320000	But from the perspective of international law, Taiwan is not yet.
320000	322000	Of course, I will say why it is not.
322000	331000	In addition, international law is the principle that determines the rights and obligations of the political entity on international law and its right to carry out its obligations.
331000	334000	The scope of international law is actually very wide.
334000	343000	Generally, when people hear international law, they sometimes feel that it is related to a place, a country, or diplomacy.
343000	349000	In fact, the scope of international law is very wide, including political, economic, military, and human rights.
349000	353000	For example, international relations, diplomacy, and business.
353000	359000	Then there is economic, import-export trade, currency exchange, financial transactions, and securities transactions.
359000	365000	In fact, today some people say that international law does not seem to have any effect.
365000	375000	In fact, if we want to implement import-export trade, or even if we want to study abroad,
375000	380000	or when you go sightseeing and need to exchange foreign currency, this is also related to international law.
380000	389000	Even now, some people may be in the United States, and then you can buy and sell securities and goods from other countries.
389000	393000	These financial transactions are all related to international law.
393000	401000	Then, for example, the military part, such as hand-to-hand combat, stop-and-go, how to end the war, military occupation.
401000	405000	Then, for example, the restrictions on nuclear and biological weapons.
405000	412000	For example, recently, the US withdrew the Semiconductor Missile Agreement.
412000	416000	These are all related to the military.
416000	423000	Then, for example, the human rights part, such as the right to freedom, the right to self-determination, the right to life, the right to transport, and the human rights law.
423000	438000	In fact, basically, we can say that as long as you have a connection with other countries, no matter what form of connection it is, it will be related to international law.
438000	446000	Hearing international law, there is often a reaction that international law is bigger and more powerful than fist.
446000	451000	However, it must be emphasized here that international law is not only bigger than fist.
451000	457000	Because if it is really bigger than fist, I believe that the biggest fist in the world now is the United States.
457000	462000	But even if the United States has such a big fist, it can't stop it.
462000	466000	That is, the wife of Palestine, she was born in front of the United Nations.
466000	472000	The United States is only one vote in the United Nations, in the General Assembly, and in the Security Council.
472000	478000	So it can't decide everything, although its fist may be the biggest in the world.
478000	485000	In addition, for example, China, of course, can't prevent the International Court of Justice from making a judgment against it.
485000	493000	Of course, at this time, some people will say that although it is said that it is not conducive to its judgment, China is still my heart and my tree.
493000	496000	But we have to think a little bit, that is, yes, that's right.
496000	508000	Although the Philippine was against the South China Sea part of the International Court of Justice, and then the International Court of Justice put China on it.
508000	518000	Later, the International Court of Justice made some of China's claims that there was no legal effect, that is, it did not have those rights.
518000	529000	Although China later decided not to recognize these things, other countries made such a decision because of the International Court of Justice.
529000	538000	So other countries, such as the United States, claimed that since the International Court of Justice believed that the right to claim did not exist,
539000	544000	then I followed the rules of the International Court of Justice, such as the International Ocean Law, and I exercised my freedom of navigation.
544000	548000	There are other countries, such as the United Kingdom, who are also exercising their freedom of navigation.
548000	561000	When other countries make a decision because of you, such as the International Court of Justice, and then let other countries obtain other basis on the International Law to exercise their rights, this is the effect of the International Law.
562000	570000	So what the International Law represents is to tell everyone that there is more than just a fist in the international community.
570000	578000	Because even if you have a fist as big as China, and then it is not willing to recognize the decision made by the International Court of Justice,
578000	585000	but other countries can still act according to the judgment made by the International Court of Justice.
585000	591000	At this time, even if China is dissatisfied, it can only look aside.
591000	599000	In this regard, I would like to let everyone know that the strong can set the rules, and the weak must comply with the rules.
599000	612000	The International Law is actually a decision made by the great powers and the strong to discuss and make a political decision.
613000	631000	The main purpose of the International Law is to allow different countries to solve disputes in a civilized and legal way, rather than a rapid war.
631000	642000	So in this case, we can know that the International Law is to some extent a bit like a structure on the balance of danger.
642000	649000	So in this case, even if it is a big country, it will feel that it is necessary to comply with the International Law.
649000	655000	Because if it does not comply with the International Law, other big countries may not comply with the International Law, and then it will be a mess.
655000	661000	In the event that everyone gives up their strength, it may be the end of the world.
661000	668000	For countries that are not strong, the strength is not so strong.
668000	676000	In fact, it is more important to understand what the rules are made by these big countries, and then to make good use of these rules.
676000	682000	Because in this case, you are not saying that you are bigger than the fist, you are a small fist against a big fist, you will win.
682000	688000	But if you follow the rules of the International Law, the rules of the International Law are a rule created by the power.
688000	696000	When you follow the rules created by the power to deal with other powers, you are like standing on the shoulders of a giant.
696000	700000	Although you may be a small person, you are standing on the shoulders of a giant.
700000	712000	The International Law is actually very useful, and in fact, for the weaker object, the greater the impact of the International Law, the stronger the meaning.
712000	714000	In fact, here I want to mention a simple example.
714000	727000	For example, after the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, it took 22 years and 24 days for it to become the representative government of China in the United Nations on October 25, 1971.
727000	733000	On October 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution No. 2758 was passed.
733000	742000	According to that resolution, the representative of China in the United Nations is the representative of the People's Republic of China.
742000	759000	So we all know that although the People's Republic of China came to Taiwan because of the civil war, and the so-called mainland China was controlled by the People's Republic of China.
759000	769000	But even though the power is so different, the People's Republic of China also took more than 20 years to enter the United Nations.
769000	777000	So it's not that it's really bigger than the fist. If it's really bigger than the fist, it should have entered earlier, and it wouldn't have waited more than 20 years.
777000	791000	Then again, like Palestine, it was after the independence of Palestine was announced on November 15, 1988. It took 24 years and 14 days for it to become a member of the United Nations.
791000	803000	So we find that whether it is a strong, stronger foundation of the People's Republic of China, or a very weak Palestine.
803000	812000	But after they were established, it took a long time for them to enter the international community, for example, to enter the United Nations.
813000	819000	So we know that whether it is strong or weak, the international law has a certain impact on them.
819000	827000	I am here to talk about the United Nations, because whether it is the People's Republic of China regime or Palestine,
827000	833000	they entered the United Nations today in accordance with the regulations set by the United Nations itself.
833000	840000	Of course, the regulations set by the United Nations International Organization also follow the regulations set by the international law.
840000	850000	So basically everyone follows the regulations of the international law. No one says that I have a big fist today, so I can listen to me directly.
850000	856000	Or that I am very weak, so everyone has to pity me. In fact, there is no such thing.
856000	867000	So I think that the international law has the greatest effect on the weak, which is to increase the competition with the strong, and then the political and legal defense.
867000	881000	In fact, this is especially important for Taiwan. I think that many people who come to participate today may have a nationality from other countries, for example, you may have a nationality in the United States.
882000	895000	Maybe you don't feel so strongly about this, but if you say that the nationality you have today or the place you are in is a relatively weak place in international politics or international relations,
895000	902000	in fact, you will feel that if everyone is just a fist, there is not much effect.
902000	911000	But if there is an international law as a backer, when you go to fight for some rights with others, you will have the opportunity to get what you want.
912000	915000	Can I ask a question?
915000	925000	You just said that there are three kinds of political entities in the world, the state, the WHO, and Taiwan or Somaliland.
926000	935000	Then you just had a statement that all interactions between countries must abide by international law.
935000	945000	I want to ask that the object of the international law is actually the country, that is, the ABC of the three A or ABC?
946000	947000	ABC.
947000	949000	So all three are required?
949000	950000	Yes.
950000	956000	Because I just said that the basic interactions between political entities in international law are regulated.
956000	960000	So the political entities in international law include those three things.
961000	963000	OK, thank you.
969000	979000	I think everyone has heard of the four elements of a country, namely territory, people, and government.
980000	982000	Then there is sovereignty.
982000	1000000	For example, if you were educated in Taiwan, you would probably know the four elements of a country, namely territory, people, government, and sovereignty.
1000000	1005000	But I want to tell you that this statement is wrong.
1005000	1017000	The reason is that sovereignty is something that a country will have after it is formed.
1017000	1023000	So it is not a basic element that constitutes a country.
1023000	1028000	It is something that you will have after you become a country.
1029000	1037000	So if you say that sovereignty is an element that constitutes a country, this is a bit of a logical question.
1037000	1044000	Basically, it should be said that it is not the so-called four elements, but the characteristics that a sovereign country should have.
1044000	1051000	That is, in the Montevideo Convention on the Rights of the Nation, it talks about territory, people, and government.
1052000	1059000	In addition, there is the so-called diplomatic ability, which is the ability to communicate with other sovereign countries.
1059000	1064000	I particularly emphasize the ability to communicate with other sovereign countries.
1065000	1075000	And the important thing is that the sovereign country must treat you as a sovereign country.
1075000	1086000	When you communicate with the so-called official position, your diplomatic ability is truly recognized.
1087000	1092000	So in fact, a country, a very interesting thing is that the so-called sovereign country needs to have characteristics,
1092000	1099000	In addition to those entities that can be seen, such as territory, people, and government,
1099000	1105000	The other part of the diplomatic ability is actually directly linked to the so-called recognition part.
1105000	1112000	In fact, of course, some people say that you are or are not a country today, and you do not need other countries to recognize you.
1112000	1120000	But now the question is whether you are a country or whether you can play the role of a country.
1120000	1126000	In fact, it depends on whether other countries treat you as a country.
1126000	1137000	So whether or not you are recognized today is the key to becoming a country.
1137000	1145000	But to be recognized by other countries, to recognize that you are a country, is to allow you to operate like a country,
1145000	1151000	Or like a country, a basic prerequisite for connecting with other countries.
1151000	1157000	So in fact, when we have the so-called territory today, and the people have the government,
1157000	1165000	Then, with the diplomatic ability to be equal to other countries, you will have a so-called sovereign thing.
1165000	1175000	In fact, the form of sovereign performance is that it can control or manage the land and people internally,
1175000	1180000	Then you can have diplomatic relations with other countries.
1180000	1186000	So in fact, sovereign countries need to have these characteristics.
1186000	1194000	Basically, we can say that if it is a country, it will have these characteristics.
1194000	1200000	But having these characteristics does not mean that you are a country.
1200000	1205000	This is a bit logical, that is, if P is Q, if it is not Q, it is not P.
1205000	1213000	But you can't say that if P is Q, then if it is not P, then it is not Q. This logic is wrong.
1213000	1218000	OK, here is another basic knowledge.
1218000	1224000	That is, we have to distinguish between the so-called country, the government, and the regime.
1224000	1232000	The so-called country is a political entity with international law that dominates the national legal personality.
1232000	1239000	The regime is a political group with practical power and governance ability.
1239000	1247000	So if there is a group of people today and they form an organization,
1247000	1254000	Then that organization has practical control and can govern a certain place and govern a certain people.
1254000	1263000	We can say that the organization built by this group of people is a so-called regime.
1263000	1269000	Then there is another so-called government. The government is a government that can represent the country, that is, represent the country externally.
1269000	1278000	Then internally, it can govern the people and the land, and it is a regime that conducts diplomacy externally.
1278000	1282000	The distinction between this place and this place is very important.
1282000	1290000	Because if we put these three things together today, we will often have problems when we judge some problems.
1290000	1295000	Especially when facing the situation in Taiwan.
1295000	1303000	There are a few points here. The first is that a country can only have a government that represents the country, the so-called government.
1303000	1307000	The representative government is a regime that can represent the country.
1307000	1316000	So we know that the representative government is a regime, but this regime has another special nature, that is, it can represent the country.
1316000	1325000	In a country, there may be several regimes at the same time, and these several regimes are in the so-called representative government.
1325000	1331000	If there is such a situation, it is the so-called representative power struggle.
1331000	1336000	The most direct example is China, which is related to Taiwan.
1336000	1345000	From October 1, 1949 to today, the representative power struggle between the People's Republic of China government and the People's Republic of China government.
1345000	1349000	I also wrote the government here. In fact, we all know that they call themselves the government.
1349000	1354000	In fact, it is the regime of the People's Republic of China and the regime of the People's Republic of China.
1354000	1357000	They are fighting for the position of the Chinese representative government.
1357000	1364000	Which one wins will become the so-called Chinese government, the Chinese representative government.
1364000	1371000	The other is Venezuela. Venezuela just happened this year.
1371000	1376000	We know that the government of Maduro, and then there was a government of Guaido.
1376000	1380000	Guaido is a leader of the ruling party.
1380000	1385000	He thinks that the election of the Maduro government was problematic.
1385000	1389000	He does not recognize the election result.
1389000	1396000	In addition, Maduro's previous governance had a big problem.
1396000	1401000	There was a very big financial problem in Venezuela.
1401000	1404000	Guaido felt that he could not do it.
1404000	1412000	He appointed himself as the temporary president and established the so-called transitional government.
1412000	1421000	The interesting thing here is that the United States was the first to recognize that Guaido's transitional government was the representative government of Venezuela.
1421000	1425000	The Maduro government is not the representative government.
1425000	1439000	The interesting thing here is that other countries can choose which regime is the representative government of another country.
1439000	1446000	After their choice, they will follow their choice to deal with the government of this country.
1446000	1455000	For example, after the Maduro government decided to recognize Guaido's transitional government in the United States,
1455000	1461000	it ordered the U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela.
1461000	1471000	The U.S. government's response is that we now recognize that Guaido's transitional government is the legitimate government of Venezuela.
1471000	1475000	Since the U.S. government is not the legitimate government of Venezuela,
1475000	1481000	the U.S. government's request to the U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela is illegal.
1481000	1483000	The U.S. government does not recognize this request.
1483000	1486000	So the U.S. diplomats continue to stay in Venezuela.
1486000	1491000	This is actually a very interesting situation.
1491000	1497000	We know that countries have various characteristics.
1497000	1502000	Some of these characteristics are necessary, while some are not.
1502000	1511000	Let's see how these characteristics will change after the change.
1511000	1513000	First, let's talk about nationality.
1513000	1516000	Every country has a nationality, which is its name.
1516000	1520000	Of course, it can be changed, but its change will not affect its legal personality.
1520000	1532000	For example, if my name is Huang Shengfeng, and if I change my name to Lai Qingde, I will not become the former director of the Executive Yuan.
1532000	1535000	The same goes for countries.
1535000	1540000	After the country's nationality is changed, its national legal personality will not change.
1540000	1547000	A recent example is that Swaziland was renamed Swaziland in 2018.
1547000	1552000	Another example is that the Qing Dynasty changed its name to the Republic of China in 1912.
1552000	1555000	I say that the Republic of China was renamed.
1555000	1564000	You may think that the Republic of China was not founded by Sun Wen to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.
1564000	1571000	In fact, the Republic of China was founded by Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty.
1571000	1576000	Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty issued a decree of abdication in 1912.
1576000	1582000	In this decree, he announced that the Qing Dynasty would be changed from an imperial system to a republic system.
1582000	1587000	The Qing Dynasty would become the Great Republic of China, which was allied with the Han Dynasty.
1587000	1592000	Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty appointed Yuan Shikai as the temporary government.
1592000	1603000	The Qing Dynasty changed from an imperial system to a republic system.
1603000	1607000	The Qing Dynasty changed its name to the Republic of China.
1607000	1617000	The Qing Dynasty was later replaced by Yuan Shikai's temporary government.
1617000	1624000	Some people may not believe it, but I want to make it simple.
1624000	1633000	In the 6th year of the Republic of China, the so-called Xuantong 9th year,
1633000	1637000	there was a thing called Zhang Xun's abdication.
1637000	1644000	If you have read the history of the Republic of China textbooks, you will know the so-called Zhang Xun's abdication.
1644000	1651000	Zhang Xun's abdication means that the Republic of China changed from a republic system to an imperial system.
1651000	1655000	So Puyi ascended the throne again.
1655000	1657000	Let's think about one thing.
1657000	1663000	If the Qing Dynasty was overthrown today, if this country was overthrown,
1663000	1670000	and the Republic of China was a new country, how could you change it back?
1670000	1675000	It's just a simple change of a system, and then the name was changed and changed again.
1675000	1680000	If you are building a new country today, how could you change it like this?
1680000	1681000	In fact, it's not.
1681000	1686000	Because the Republic of China itself is the Qing Dynasty itself.
1686000	1689000	It just changed the system and changed the name.
1689000	1695000	So when Zhang Xun abdicated, because it was the same, it was able to return to its previous state.
1695000	1701000	So Zhang Xun's abdication tells us that the Republic of China is the same as the Qing Dynasty.
1701000	1705000	It's just a different name. It's just a different system.
1705000	1710000	This is actually the so-called renaissance constitution.
1710000	1711000	We can think of it this way.
1711000	1713000	In fact, this is the renaissance constitution.
1713000	1716000	The Qing Dynasty changed the name to the Republic of China.
1716000	1718000	Originally, the Qing Dynasty did not have a constitution.
1718000	1722000	Later, the Republic of China was changed to a temporary constitution.
1722000	1725000	It is the so-called renaissance constitution.
1725000	1730000	The renaissance constitution is no different from the constitutional constitution advocated by some people today.
1730000	1738000	So I found that if you change the name of a country, change its system, or make some regulations,
1738000	1742000	it will not affect the nature of this country.
1742000	1744000	Another so-called government.
1744000	1746000	If necessary, it can be changed.
1746000	1749000	Its change does not affect the national law.
1749000	1751000	Let me give you an example.
1751000	1757000	In 1928, China's representative government changed from the US government to the national government.
1757000	1763000	The textbooks of the Republic of China tell us that
1763000	1770000	Jiang Jieshi led the North and later unified China.
1770000	1772000	The North was successful.
1772000	1780000	In fact, the process of the whole North was the so-called Beiyang government, the representative government of China.
1780000	1784000	It was overthrown by the rebellious government.
1784000	1787000	That is to say, before the completion of the North,
1787000	1793000	Jiang Jieshi led the so-called national government.
1793000	1796000	In fact, it was a rebellious government.
1796000	1801000	After the rebellious government successfully overthrew the original representative government,
1801000	1807000	there was no other government in the Republic of China to compete with it.
1807000	1811000	So the national government became the representative government of the Republic of China.
1811000	1818000	Other countries originally came to the Republic of China with the Beiyang government.
1818000	1823000	Later, the Beiyang government was eliminated and replaced by the national government.
1823000	1827000	Other countries continue to come to the national government.
1828000	1830000	They are from the same country, but they still come from China.
1830000	1833000	They just come from different governments.
1833000	1838000	In fact, this is the meaning of the civil war in the Republic of China.
1838000	1845000	The civil war in the Republic of China is that the national government meets another competitor.
1845000	1848000	The system can be changed when necessary.
1848000	1851000	Its change does not affect the national law.
1851000	1857000	Here, we mentioned that China changed from a geological system to a republic system in 1912.
1857000	1863000	For example, France changed from a geological system to a republic system in the French Revolution in 1792.
1863000	1866000	We know that France is now the fifth republic.
1866000	1872000	In other words, after the French Revolution, it first became a republic system.
1872000	1877000	Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.
1877000	1881000	Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.
1881000	1884000	Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.
1884000	1887000	Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.
1887000	1890000	So we know that a country's system can be changed.
1890000	1893000	Geological system, republic system, etc.
1893000	1894000	But the country is still the same.
1894000	1897000	Otherwise, we would not talk about the so-called French Revolution.
1897000	1899000	They are all from the same country.
1899000	1901000	It's just a system change.
1901000	1903000	In addition, there is the Constitution.
1903000	1905000	The Constitution is not necessary.
1906000	1916000	Because if the Constitution is necessary, we will find that there may be no country before the so-called military constitution.
1916000	1917000	In fact, it is not.
1917000	1922000	Because before the military constitution, all countries are monarchical systems.
1922000	1924000	There is no Constitution.
1924000	1926000	But these countries still exist.
1926000	1931000	Even to this day, they still belong to the imperial system.
1931000	1934000	For example, we have some chief states on the Arabian Peninsula.
1934000	1937000	These chief states are the imperial system.
1937000	1941000	They do not have the Constitution.
1941000	1947000	The Constitution is re-created and revised.
1947000	1951000	No matter how many times, it does not affect the order of the National Security Council.
1951000	1952000	Or change it.
1952000	1955000	For example, I can say that the French constitution is 17 times.
1955000	1956000	You may be surprised.
1956000	1958000	The French constitution is 17 times.
1958000	1959000	Re-created.
1959000	1960000	Not revised.
1960000	1961000	Re-created 17 times.
1961000	1966000	The latest constitution has been revised 24 times.
1966000	1970000	But we will not say that the French constitution is 17 times.
1970000	1974000	So France died and was born again.
1974000	1975000	Died and was born again.
1975000	1976000	More than ten times.
1976000	1977000	We do not think so.
1977000	1979000	It is still the same country.
1979000	1984000	So, the Constitution or the revision of the Constitution will not affect the national character.
1984000	1986000	In addition, there is the state flag.
1986000	1987000	The state flag is actually unnecessary.
1987000	1989000	No one stipulates that the country must have a state flag.
1989000	1991000	But that is a symbol.
1991000	1993000	So usually there will be.
1993000	1995000	To change it will not affect the national character.
1995000	1999000	The national anthem is the same.
1999000	2003000	Here we will start to enter the topic.
2003000	2005000	Taiwan's international law status.
2005000	2008000	Here we have to define what Taiwan is.
2008000	2012000	Taiwan actually has several definitions.
2012000	2013000	The most common is that
2013000	2015000	In the current range of the People's Republic of China regime.
2015000	2017000	Including Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen.
2017000	2020000	There are other regions controlled by the regime in reality.
2020000	2022000	For example, Dongsha Island, Taiping Island.
2022000	2024000	These places.
2024000	2025000	The other is Guangyi.
2025000	2027000	That is the so-called island of Taiwan.
2027000	2028000	With its affiliated islands.
2028000	2029000	Then there is Penghu Island.
2029000	2031000	This is Guangyi.
2031000	2033000	That is the island of Taiwan.
2033000	2035000	With its affiliated islands.
2035000	2036000	That is not included in Penghu Island.
2036000	2039000	That is the island of Taiwan.
2040000	2043000	In today's briefing.
2043000	2045000	Unless I list Penghu at the same time today.
2045000	2047000	Otherwise, basically speaking.
2047000	2048000	This is Guangyi.
2048000	2050000	This is the island of Taiwan.
2050000	2053000	With its affiliated islands.
2053000	2055000	Then there is Penghu Island.
2055000	2057000	That does not include other places.
2057000	2059000	So it does not include Kinmen, Mazu.
2059000	2061000	And Dongsha, Taiping.
2061000	2063000	These places.
2063000	2066000	In fact, the past of Taiwan.
2066000	2068000	In fact, history is very long.
2068000	2071000	But because what we are going to talk about today.
2071000	2074000	It is relatively close to the modern history of Taiwan.
2074000	2076000	So I think I will.
2076000	2078000	Probably from Taiwan and China.
2078000	2079000	Began to be involved.
2079000	2081000	For example, modern China.
2081000	2083000	Let's start with less involved places.
2083000	2084000	But in this place.
2084000	2085000	We can take a look first.
2085000	2086000	This is the Qing Dynasty.
2086000	2087000	The emperor of the Qing Dynasty.
2087000	2089000	This is Emperor Yongzheng.
2089000	2090000	He said.
2090000	2092000	Taiwan has not belonged to China since ancient times.
2092000	2095000	The imperial examination of the God of War revealed the map.
2096000	2098000	The imperial examination of the God of War revealed the map.
2098000	2101000	This is the father of Emperor Yongzheng.
2101000	2103000	Also Emperor Kangxi.
2103000	2104000	In other words.
2104000	2106000	This place in Taiwan.
2106000	2110000	Until Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty.
2110000	2114000	To really enter the so-called map of China.
2114000	2115000	But before that.
2115000	2116000	Basically speaking.
2116000	2119000	Taiwan is not part of China.
2119000	2122000	So we know.
2122000	2123000	People's Republic of China.
2123000	2126000	Now claim that Taiwan is part of China.
2126000	2128000	The indivisible part.
2128000	2129000	Since ancient times.
2129000	2130000	We know.
2130000	2135000	In fact, many people do not agree with the facts.
2135000	2137000	In this place.
2137000	2139000	I think there are some points.
2139000	2140000	For example.
2140000	2143000	Because I'm talking about this now.
2143000	2145000	China is related to Taiwan.
2145000	2146000	And it is related to modern Taiwan.
2146000	2147000	So we jump directly.
2147000	2148000	Jump to 1662.
2148000	2151000	Is the part of Zheng Chenggong's defeat of the Netherlands.
2151000	2152000	Before that.
2152000	2154000	Is that.
2154000	2155000	Other western countries.
2155000	2156000	The part of the people of Taiwan.
2156000	2159000	The place has jumped.
2159000	2160000	In 1662.
2160000	2162000	Zheng Chenggong's defeat of the Netherlands.
2162000	2163000	We know.
2163000	2166000	The so-called anti-Qing people.
2166000	2167000	Later.
2167000	2169000	Not long after he came to Taiwan.
2169000	2170000	Died.
2170000	2172000	His son.
2172000	2173000	Zheng Jing.
2173000	2174000	Later.
2174000	2177000	Established the so-called Donglin Kingdom.
2177000	2178000	That.
2178000	2180000	Donglin Kingdom.
2180000	2181000	On the island of Taiwan.
2181000	2183000	Is.
2183000	2184000	More.
2184000	2185000	The Chinese side.
2185000	2186000	Is.
2186000	2187000	In fact.
2187000	2188000	In Taiwan.
2188000	2190000	More.
2190000	2192000	The beginning of a systematic degeneration.
2192000	2193000	Then.
2193000	2194000	In 1683.
2194000	2196000	In the 7th month of the Donglin Kingdom.
2196000	2197000	When he was at the Penghu Sea War.
2197000	2199000	He was defeated by the Qing Empire.
2199000	2200000	Then.
2200000	2201000	Surrender in September.
2201000	2202000	In October.
2202000	2203000	Enter the sea.
2203000	2204000	Enter Taiwan.
2204000	2205000	Then he surrendered.
2205000	2206000	So at this time.
2206000	2207000	Because.
2207000	2208000	The Qing Empire.
2208000	2209000	Then.
2209000	2210000	This.
2210000	2211000	The Qing Empire.
2211000	2212000	Emperor Kangxi.
2212000	2213000	Later.
2213000	2214000	Decided.
2214000	2215000	To take Taiwan.
2215000	2216000	Into the so-called territory.
2216000	2217000	Of course.
2217000	2218000	That is to say.
2218000	2219000	The Qing Empire itself.
2219000	2220000	In.
2220000	2221000	Defeated.
2221000	2222000	Zheng Chenggong.
2222000	2223000	Defeated.
2223000	2224000	After the Donglin Kingdom.
2224000	2225000	Is.
2225000	2226000	To take Taiwan into.
2226000	2227000	This.
2227000	2228000	The territory of the Qing Empire.
2228000	2229000	Inside.
2229000	2230000	They also have a fight.
2230000	2231000	But later.
2231000	2232000	Anyway.
2232000	2233000	After a fight.
2233000	2234000	So I still decided.
2234000	2235000	All right.
2235000	2236000	Let's take Taiwan into the territory.
2236000	2237000	But.
2237000	2238000	No active management.
2238000	2239000	Then.
2239000	2240000	In 1867.
2240000	2241000	This.
2241000	2242000	The so-called United States.
2242000	2243000	The Rovahao Incident.
2243000	2244000	That is.
2244000	2245000	The United States.
2245000	2246000	Uploaded.
2246000	2247000	He is.
2247000	2248000	In the east.
2248000	2249000	Here.
2249000	2250000	Then.
2250000	2251000	Later.
2251000	2252000	Accidentally.
2252000	2253000	Into.
2253000	2254000	This.
2254000	2255000	Taiwan's territory.
2255000	2256000	Then.
2256000	2257000	As a result.
2257000	2258000	Later.
2258000	2259000	Many people were fired.
2259000	2260000	That.
2260000	2261000	Living.
2261000	2262000	Living people.
2262000	2263000	Run.
2263000	2264000	Go to the Qing Empire.
2264000	2265000	A small report.
2265000	2266000	As a result.
2266000	2267000	The Qing Empire said.
2267000	2268000	Then he.
2268000	2269000	Do not care.
2269000	2270000	From this place.
2270000	2271000	You can see.
2271000	2272000	One thing.
2272000	2273000	That is.
2273000	2274000	For the Qing Empire.
2274000	2276000	For the Qing Empire.
2276000	2278000	The so-called deep.
2278000	2279000	He does not think.
2279000	2280000	Is his own territory.
2280000	2281000	That is.
2281000	2282000	He can't control.
2282000	2283000	The place.
2283000	2284000	He thinks.
2284000	2285000	That is not actually his territory.
2285000	2286000	So.
2286000	2287000	It's not his territory.
2287000	2288000	Within the scope of things.
2288000	2289000	It's not.
2289000	2290000	He can manage.
2290000	2291000	So.
2291000	2292000	We can see from this place.
2292000	2293000	That is.
2293000	2294000	The Qing Empire.
2294000	2295000	Basically.
2295000	2296000	What is his position?
2296000	2297000	On this island.
2297000	2298000	On this island.
2298000	2299000	He can control.
2299000	2300000	What is the position of the scope?
2300000	2301000	That.
2301000	2302000	The United States.
2302000	2303000	Of course.
2303000	2304000	Very angry.
2304000	2305000	Ah.
2305000	2306000	That's good.
2306000	2307000	Since you don't care.
2307000	2308000	Then I'll do it myself.
2308000	2309000	So.
2309000	2310000	The United States.
2310000	2311000	He himself.
2311000	2312000	Send troops away.
2312000	2313000	To Taiwan.
2313000	2314000	So.
2314000	2315000	This is the U.S. Marine Corps.
2315000	2316000	Just.
2316000	2317000	Landed in Taiwan.
2317000	2318000	Then.
2318000	2319000	To this.
2319000	2320000	The native of the Taiwanese people.
2320000	2321000	Just.
2321000	2322000	Fight with him.
2322000	2323000	As a result.
2323000	2324000	Since defeated.
2324000	2325000	Lost.
2325000	2326000	This.
2326000	2327000	Now this is.
2327000	2328000	The U.S. Marine Corps.
2328000	2329000	Everyone knows.
2329000	2330000	Hey.
2330000	2331000	Almost everyone hears it.
2331000	2332000	Wen Feng.
2332000	2333000	Wen Feng.
2333000	2334000	That's it.
2334000	2335000	Wen Feng.
2335000	2336000	That's it.
2336000	2337000	Hey.
2337000	2338000	This.
2338000	2339000	Is very powerful.
2339000	2340000	But they lost to this.
2340000	2341000	The native of Taiwan.
2341000	2342000	So.
2342000	2343000	You can know.
2343000	2344000	The native of Taiwan.
2344000	2345000	Really.
2345000	2346000	Very arrogant.
2346000	2347000	So he.
2347000	2348000	The United States.
2348000	2349000	These.
2349000	2350000	The Marines.
2350000	2351000	Attack the native of Taiwan.
2351000	2352000	Return in the rain.
2352000	2353000	Later.
2353000	2354000	Three months later.
2354000	2355000	Just.
2355000	2356000	In Langqiao.
2356000	2357000	With the head of the 18th Division of the Taiwan Army.
2357000	2358000	This.
2358000	2359000	This.
2359000	2360000	Zhou Qidu.
2360000	2361000	He fought with him.
2361000	2362000	Then.
2362000	2363000	He signed the so-called.
2363000	2364000	Alliance of the Southern Xia.
2364000	2365000	Then.
2365000	2366000	Officially ended.
2366000	2367000	This.
2367000	2368000	Luo Fahao Incident.
2368000	2369000	Then.
2369000	2370000	This Alliance of the Southern Xia.
2370000	2371000	Basically.
2371000	2372000	That is to say.
2372000	2373000	In the future.
2373000	2374000	If there is a ship.
2374000	2375000	In case of.
2375000	2376000	What kind of.
2376000	2377000	When the shipwreck happened.
2377000	2378000	Then.
2378000	2379000	If they say.
2379000	2380000	Raised a.
2380000	2381000	What label.
2381000	2382000	For example.
2382000	2383000	Raised a red flag.
2383000	2384000	Then.
2384000	2385000	The United States.
2385000	2386000	This.
2386000	2387000	Is.
2387000	2388000	A kind of agreement.
2388000	2389000	That.
2389000	2390000	From this place.
2390000	2391000	We can see that.
2391000	2392000	This.
2392000	2393000	The United States.
2393000	2394000	With.
2394000	2395000	The aborigines.
2395000	2396000	They signed.
2396000	2397000	Such an agreement.
2397000	2398000	But.
2398000	2399000	Signed such an agreement.
2399000	2400000	Is it representative of.
2400000	2401000	This.
2401000	2402000	The Taiwan Army 18th Division.
2402000	2403000	They.
2403000	2404000	In the eyes of the United States.
2404000	2405000	Is.
2405000	2406000	A country.
2406000	2407000	In fact, this.
2407000	2408000	To put on a question mark.
2408000	2409000	Just.
2409000	2410000	Because in fact.
2410000	2411000	This is the US government.
2411000	2412000	They are with.
2412000	2413000	Under the international law.
2413000	2414000	Modern.
2414000	2415000	Under the international law.
2415000	2416000	The sovereign state.
2416000	2417000	The same.
2417000	2418000	Can sign some agreements.
2418000	2419000	Sign some agreements.
2419000	2420000	So.
2420000	2421000	Even if it is.
2421000	2422000	Signed such an agreement.
2422000	2423000	It does not mean that.
2423000	2424000	At that time.
2424000	2425000	The United States.
2425000	2426000	Is.
2426000	2427000	This.
2427000	2428000	Taiwan Army 18th Division.
2428000	2429000	This piece.
2429000	2430000	Recognize it.
2430000	2431000	Is a country.
2431000	2432000	But what we can be sure of is.
2432000	2433000	He thinks.
2433000	2434000	He is with a regime.
2434000	2435000	Is signing.
2435000	2436000	Just.
2436000	2437000	Because he thinks.
2437000	2438000	He can control that place.
2438000	2439000	A regime.
2439000	2440000	And then.
2440000	2441000	In.
2441000	2442000	In.
2442000	2443000	After more than a year.
2443000	2444000	This.
2444000	2445000	Li Xian.
2445000	2446000	Again.
2446000	2447000	With that.
2447000	2448000	Zhuo Qidu.
2448000	2449000	In China.
2449000	2450000	The customs tax officer.
2450000	2451000	Under the witness.
2451000	2452000	Signing a memorandum of understanding.
2452000	2453000	That's here.
2453000	2454000	I'm talking about.
2454000	2455000	Under the witness.
2455000	2456000	So we know that.
2456000	2457000	This.
2457000	2458000	This Chinese customs.
2458000	2459000	The official.
2459000	2460000	He is just a witness.
2460000	2461000	He is not the party.
2461000	2462000	So we know that.
2462000	2463000	In this case.
2463000	2464000	It is a very.
2464000	2465000	It is a very.
2465000	2466000	It is a very.
2466000	2467000	It is a very.
2467000	2468000	It is a very.
2468000	2469000	It's a very.
2469000	2470000	It's a very.
2470000	2471000	It's a very.
2471000	2472000	It's a very very memorable.
2472000	2473000	It's a very memorable.
2473000	2474000	In this case it's a very interesting thing.
2474000	2475000	The United States and.
2475000	2480000	With this.
2480000	2481000	The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.
2481000	2482000	The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.
2482000	2483000	The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.
2483000	2484000	Signed with him.
2484000	2485000	This thing.
2485000	2486000	China's third-person role.
2486000	2487000	China's third-person role.
2487000	2488000	challenged
2488000	2489000	Be a witness.
2489000	2490000	China's third-person role.
2490000	2491000	Not be a person's character.
2491000	2492000	Not be Person's anime.
2492000	2493000	It can be seen from this that it means that China does not really believe that that place is his territory.
2494000	2497000	Then there was an event at the peony bazaar in 1878 lecture.
2497000	2498000	Then there was an event at the peony bazaar in 1878 lecture.
2498000	2499000	Many people know.
2499000	2500000	It is.
2500000	2501000	Liu Lib LA.
2501000	2502000	Liu Lib LA.
2502000	2503000	OK.
2503000	2504000	Liu Lib LA.
2504000	2505000	OK.
2505000	2506000	It is happening for thevious reasons.
2506000	2507000	It is happening for vicious reasons.
2507000	2513000	After it, the land was villagers encountered with native people.
2513000	2514000	After it, the land was villagers encountered with native people.
2514000	2516000	Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.
2516000	2518000	Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.
2518000	2519000	Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.
2519000	2521000	Then some peko подборFF Escaped by battle.
2521000	2522700	At this time,
2523000	2525000	In the imperial State of Japan,
2525000	2526000	In the imperial State of Japan,
2526000	2528200	during the great British competition with the King
2528200	2529000	toward the imperial State of the New Republic.
2529000	2536000	during the great British competition with the King
2537000	2539000	The曷ren commander of the Imperial Japanese Palace
2539000	2541000	The曷ren commander of the Imperial Japanese Palace
2541000	2543000	Recently, he Roosevelt asked
2543000	2543000	
2543000	2545000	Recently, he Roosevelt asked
2545000	2547000	The one who killed the King of Taiwan
2547000	2549000	The one who killed the King of Taiwan
2549000	2550760	You are not the King of the Empire
2550760	2552000	You are not the king of the empire
2552000	2555460	The great New Empire not to
2555460	2555460	
2555460	2555460	
2555460	2557460	The great New Empire
2557460	2559460	The great New Empire
2559460	2563460	King's imperial reuse
2563460	2565460	King's imperial rebirth
2565460	2565460	
2565460	2567460	The great New Empire said
2567460	2570460	This is a self-degraded rebirth
2570460	2572460	In other words
2572460	2573460	The great New Empire said
2573460	2574460	These people can't control
2574460	2575460	So we found that
2575460	2576460	It's the same as the Roosevelt incident
2576460	2579460	The attitude of the great New Empire is like this
2579460	2581460	The attitude of Japan is OK
2581460	2582460	Well, since that's the case
2582460	2584460	You think these
2584460	2587460	The place where the rebirth is located is not your territory
2587460	2588460	Then you can't control these
2588460	2590460	Then I'll take care of it, right?
2590460	2593460	Because I think the Great Japanese Empire said
2593460	2595460	I think the King of the Empire
2595460	2597460	It's also my territory
2597460	2599460	So I want to protect my territory
2599460	2601460	So I'm going to punish
2601460	2604460	These rebirths in Taiwan
2604460	2607460	So Japan sent troops to the so-called five main regions
2607460	2610460	Five main regions
2610460	2611460	So later
2611460	2613460	Japan, of course, sent troops to attack
2613460	2615460	Mutan Temple, Kaosifu Temple
2615460	2617460	And then
2617460	2619460	After defeating these aborigines
2619460	2622460	He camped in that place
2622460	2623460	For the Great Japanese Empire
2623460	2625460	It's actually a very embarrassing thing
2625460	2628460	That is
2628460	2629460	You are the Great Japanese Empire
2629460	2631460	You go to this island of Taiwan today
2631460	2633460	You have to go
2633460	2634460	For your
2634460	2636460	The fishermen of the King of the Empire
2636460	2638460	Go to
2638460	2640460	It's OK to achieve justice
2640460	2642460	But after you go there to fight
2642460	2643460	You stay there
2643460	2644460	No
2644460	2645460	Because he
2645460	2646460	The Great Japanese Empire still thinks that
2646460	2647460	The island of Taiwan is mainly his
2647460	2648460	Although Japan is there
2648460	2649460	Stay there
2649460	2651460	What do you think
2651460	2653460	So the Great Japanese Empire later
2653460	2654460	To find a way
2654460	2655460	To get rid of these things
2655460	2656460	So later
2656460	2659460	Through the intervention of the British Empire
2659460	2662460	Then signed the Beijing Treaty
2662460	2663460	After that
2663460	2665460	It's agreed in it
2665460	2668460	After that, these places on the island of Taiwan
2668460	2669460	These rebirths
2669460	2671460	The Great Japanese Empire has to find a way
2671460	2673460	To restrain
2673460	2675460	In fact, to some extent
2675460	2677460	This also means that
2677460	2678460	Britain is here
2678460	2679460	It's a statement
2679460	2680460	All right
2680460	2681460	People in these places
2681460	2682460	Basically
2682460	2684460	Or you have to manage
2684460	2685460	Or you have to manage
2685460	2686460	You have to manage
2686460	2688460	I think it's a bit like admitting
2688460	2690460	The place where those rebirths are
2690460	2692460	In fact, it is still the territory of the Great Japanese Empire
2692460	2693460	So people in these places
2693460	2694460	You have to manage
2694460	2696460	such
2696460	2698460	In 1885
2698460	2700460	The Great Japanese Empire finally
2700460	2702460	Established it in Taiwan
2702460	2703460	After two years
2703460	2705460	Officially assigned to work
2705460	2706460	As a result
2706460	2709460	It didn't take long to establish
2709460	2710460	Ten years later
2710460	2711460	Nine years
2711460	2713460	Then the Jiawu War happened
2713460	2716460	On March 23, Japan
2716460	2717460	One of the Penghu
2717460	2718460	Japan has occupied Penghu
2718460	2721460	So in the so-called Jiawu War
2721460	2723460	Penghu is actually
2723460	2725460	Involved in the war
2725460	2726460	But Japan
2726460	2728460	He has an army to occupy Penghu
2728460	2730460	Here I want to mention
2730460	2731460	In the past
2731460	2733460	Just before
2733460	2735460	Before World War I and World War II
2735460	2736460	In the International Law
2736460	2738460	Basically during the war
2738460	2741460	If you are in the war
2741460	2742460	This one
2742460	2744460	For example, the enemy occupied
2744460	2746460	His opponent's country
2746460	2748460	A piece of territory
2748460	2750460	When there is an occupation
2750460	2752460	Usually after the war
2752460	2754460	The part that was occupied
2754460	2756460	May be cut off
2756460	2757460	So in fact, Japan
2757460	2759460	On March 23, he occupied Penghu
2759460	2761460	Is meaningful
2762460	2763460	That is to say
2763460	2765460	Japan wants to say
2765460	2767460	He wants to eat Taiwan and Penghu
2767460	2769460	So anyway
2769460	2770460	On March 23
2770460	2771460	He sent the army first
2771460	2773460	To occupy Penghu
2773460	2775460	Later, when signing the contract
2775460	2776460	There is a big bargaining chip
2776460	2781460	Can ask the Qing Empire to give up Penghu
2781460	2782460	Here we can take a look
2782460	2784460	That is to say
2784460	2786460	The Qing Empire was in 1772
2786460	2787460	The scope he controlled
2787460	2788460	It's actually very small
2788460	2790460	In other words
2790460	2791460	After the Qing Empire
2791460	2793460	After he solved the Kingdom of Dongning
2793460	2794460	In 1772
2794460	2796460	The scope he actually controlled
2796460	2797460	It's still very small
2797460	2799460	Still limited to the original
2799460	2801460	The scope controlled by the Kingdom of Dongning
2801460	2803460	By 1884
2811460	2812460	Then in 1884
2816460	2818460	Then in 1884
2819460	2820460	The Qing Empire
2820460	2822460	The scope of control is relatively large
2822460	2824460	Just now
2824460	2825460	Does anyone want to speak?
2825460	2826460	Just now
2828460	2829460	It's okay, you can continue
2829460	2830460	I'm sorry
2830460	2831460	OK
2831460	2833460	In 1772
2833460	2834460	The Qing Empire
2834460	2836460	The scope of control on the island of Taiwan
2836460	2838460	Is very small
2838460	2840460	Then in 1884
2840460	2842460	His scope of control is relatively large
2842460	2843460	But we found
2843460	2845460	In the middle of the island of Taiwan
2845460	2847460	Is mainly the mountainous area
2847460	2848460	The Qing Empire
2848460	2850460	Basically uncontrollable
2850460	2852460	But actually we see
2852460	2853460	This 1884
2853460	2854460	The Qing Empire
2854460	2856460	The scope he controlled
2856460	2858460	Actually in the eastern part
2858460	2859460	For example, in the so-called
2859460	2862460	The part of Beinanting
2862460	2865460	May be a little bragging
2865460	2867460	Because actually
2867460	2868460	The Qing Empire
2868460	2870460	In the middle of the east
2870460	2871460	His ability to control
2871460	2874460	Not so strong
2874460	2876460	Then in 1895
2876460	2877460	This
2877460	2878460	The Treaty of Maguan
2878460	2880460	The Treaty of Maguan was signed on May 8th
2880460	2882460	Then the Great Japanese
2882460	2883460	In terms of international law
2883460	2884460	The Great Japanese Empire is
2884460	2886460	According to this Treaty of Maguan
2886460	2887460	To obtain the Qing Empire
2887460	2889460	The rule of law in the Taiwan Strait
2891460	2892460	Then
2892460	2894460	After a few weeks
2894460	2895460	I said it was not really
2895460	2897460	To establish an independent democratic country
2899460	2900460	Then this is also particularly emphasized
2900460	2902460	It's not really independent
2902460	2903460	Why do you say that?
2903460	2904460	Because
2904460	2906460	In fact, Taiwan is a democratic country
2906460	2909460	Some people see Taiwan as a democratic country today
2909460	2911460	I think this is the Taiwanese claim
2911460	2912460	Independent
2912460	2915460	Is a pioneer
2915460	2916460	Then there is also the belief that
2916460	2918460	Is now going to restore the country
2918460	2920460	What is the restoration of Taiwan's democracy?
2920460	2922460	But the Taiwan Democratic Republic is actually
2922460	2925460	When it was established
2925460	2927460	In fact, it's just a delay
2927460	2929460	That's just to say
2929460	2931460	Some officials of the Qing Empire
2931460	2932460	Then there were some
2932460	2933460	Some scholars at the time wanted to say
2933460	2934460	They want to say
2934460	2935460	Announce independence as soon as possible
2935460	2936460	Then
2936460	2939460	See if there are other countries to intervene
2939460	2941460	Then let Japan
2941460	2942460	There is no way to put that
2942460	2943460	Taiwan and Penghu
2943460	2944460	Become its territory
2944460	2946460	Because we know that in the Treaty of Maguan
2946460	2950460	The original part of the Great Japanese Empire
2950460	2951460	Except for Penghu, Taiwan
2951460	2952460	Including those places on the Liaodong Peninsula
2952460	2953460	As a result
2953460	2956460	There is the so-called Three Kingdoms Intervention in Liao
2956460	2958460	So actually at that time
2958460	2959460	Some officials in Taiwan
2959460	2960460	There are some scholars
2960460	2961460	They are thinking
2961460	2962460	I will announce independence as soon as possible today
2962460	2964460	Then maybe other countries will intervene
2964460	2965460	Then Japan will put Taiwan and Penghu
2965460	2967460	Into the Qing Empire
2967460	2968460	So there is such an idea
2968460	2970460	So even the Taiwan Democratic Republic
2970460	2971460	Even that year
2971460	2973460	Its year is called Yongqing
2973460	2974460	You know that this is
2974460	2977460	Always loyal to the Qing Empire
2977460	2979460	So in fact, the Taiwan Democratic Republic
2979460	2980460	It's really not
2980460	2982460	It really means independence
2982460	2985460	So in terms of international law
2985460	2988460	After the establishment of the Taiwan Democratic Republic
2988460	2989460	Basically speaking
2989460	2990460	There is no country to admit
2990460	2992460	No other country
2992460	2995460	Admit the existence of this country
2995460	2996460	Everyone can see it clearly
2996460	2998460	No one wants to
2998460	3000460	Take advantage of this
3000460	3002460	So in terms of concept
3002460	3003460	Taiwan Democratic Republic
3003460	3005460	Is on the mainland territory of the Great Japanese Empire
3005460	3008460	Taiwan's rebellion
3008460	3010460	The so-called Taiwan Democratic Republic was established by the rebellion
3010460	3013460	That's about five months later
3013460	3015460	This is the end of the military suppression
3015460	3020460	So the Taiwan Democratic Republic was destroyed
3020460	3021460	And then this
3021460	3022460	By 1910
3022460	3024460	The Great Japanese Empire began to use force
3024460	3028460	To annex the territory of the aborigines
3028460	3029460	Then I say here
3029460	3032460	Use force to annex the territory of the aborigines
3032460	3033460	Then in this place
3033460	3036460	It's a way to conquer with force
3036460	3039460	Before World War I
3039460	3042460	Is to conquer with force
3042460	3043460	Is to wage war
3043460	3046460	Use force to conquer the territory of others
3046460	3048460	Then expand your own sovereignty
3048460	3049460	Territory
3049460	3050460	In international law
3050460	3052460	Is legal
3052460	3053460	Before this
3053460	3054460	Before World War I
3054460	3056460	This is legal
3056460	3058460	But after World War I
3058460	3059460	Such behavior
3059460	3060460	Basically speaking
3060460	3062460	It is deemed illegal
3062460	3064460	That is because
3064460	3065460	To avoid the country
3065460	3068460	Expand the territory by force
3068460	3069460	Anyway
3069460	3070460	Is Japan
3070460	3071460	The Great Japanese Empire
3071460	3072460	He is using force
3072460	3073460	To conquer
3073460	3075460	Can legally expand the territory
3075460	3076460	During the period
3076460	3077460	He used force
3077460	3079460	To annex the territory of the aborigines
3079460	3082460	Then he used this
3082460	3084460	The so-called Five-Year Li Fan Plan
3084460	3086460	Is to use force to conquer
3086460	3089460	By January 15, 1915
3089460	3091460	The Five-Year Li Fan Plan was completed
3091460	3093460	It was announced to end on the 20th of the same month
3093460	3095460	This is the so-called Taiwan Islands
3095460	3096460	Out of the city
3096460	3097460	That is to say
3097460	3099460	On this day
3099460	3101460	Taiwan Islands
3101460	3103460	Every inch of land
3103460	3105460	Is his true sovereignty
3105460	3109460	Belongs to the Great Japanese Empire
3109460	3110460	So we know
3110460	3112460	Actually this
3112460	3113460	Taiwan Islands
3113460	3114460	The Great Empire
3114460	3116460	He gave it to Japan
3116460	3117460	In fact, it does not include the so-called
3117460	3118460	Central Mountain Area
3118460	3120460	Then there is the eastern part
3120460	3121460	That is Japan
3121460	3122460	After he used force to conquer
3122460	3124460	He really got a complete
3124460	3125460	Taiwan Islands
3125460	3128460	Conquered sovereignty
3128460	3129460	In 1943
3129460	3130460	This
3130460	3131460	Later
3131460	3132460	After the island returned to Japan
3132460	3134460	It's been a while
3134460	3135460	Then this
3135460	3137460	The Second World War broke out
3137460	3138460	That
3138460	3140460	On October 23, 1943
3140460	3141460	The so-called Kairo Airstrike
3141460	3142460	Then it says
3142460	3144460	The Taiwan-Japan War will return to the Republic of China
3144460	3147460	Then on July 26, 1945
3147460	3148460	The Wade Declaration
3148460	3149460	Then it says that the Kairo Declaration
3149460	3151460	Must be implemented
3151460	3153460	August 15, 1945
3153460	3154460	The Great Japanese Empire
3154460	3155460	This
3155460	3157460	The emperor of the Japanese
3157460	3159460	The Great Japanese Empire unconditionally surrendered to the Mongols
3159460	3160460	I think
3160460	3161460	Ok
3161460	3162460	Then let's jump back and see
3162460	3163460	This 1895
3163460	3164460	I just said before
3164460	3165460	I said that the Qing Empire
3165460	3166460	He
3166460	3167460	In that
3167460	3168460	The 1884
3168460	3169460	That one
3169460	3171460	He said he was on the east side
3171460	3173460	The part of the Northern Land
3173460	3174460	Say that part is a bit bragging
3174460	3175460	why
3175460	3176460	You see, in 1895
3176460	3177460	When the Great Japanese Empire
3177460	3178460	The range it can control
3178460	3180460	Not including the east
3180460	3184460	That is actually very interesting
3184460	3185460	That is to say
3185460	3186460	Because this place actually represents
3186460	3187460	That is to say
3187460	3189460	Originally these places were all
3189460	3191460	The Great Japanese Empire can effectively control
3191460	3192460	Should be able to
3192460	3194460	Effectively transfer to Japan
3194460	3196460	But actually for Japan
3196460	3198460	He said in 1895
3198460	3199460	He is on the east side
3199460	3200460	He still can't control
3200460	3202460	That place is the aboriginal place
3202460	3203460	But in 1920
3203460	3205460	Found the island of Taiwan
3205460	3208460	All included in the Great Japanese Empire
3208460	3210460	Set up this administrative plan
3210460	3212460	Japan also effectively governs
3212460	3213460	So we know that
3213460	3215460	In fact, the sovereignty of the entire island of Taiwan
3215460	3216460	In fact, the Great Japanese Empire
3216460	3218460	Is the first one
3218460	3222460	A country with sovereignty over the island of Taiwan
3222460	3223460	OK
3223460	3226460	I just talked about this in 1895
3226460	3227460	1945
3227460	3228460	August 15, 1945
3228460	3229460	This
3229460	3231460	The emperor of the Great Japanese Empire
3231460	3234460	Is to announce the surrender of the Five Straits
3234460	3235460	Then on September 2
3235460	3236460	The Great Japanese Empire
3236460	3238460	He signed the surrender document
3238460	3239460	The surrender document
3239460	3241460	It is a ceasefire agreement
3241460	3242460	That is to say
3242460	3243460	After signing this
3243460	3247460	Everyone will fire each other
3247460	3250460	So this is just a ceasefire agreement
3250460	3254460	The purpose is to end the battle
3254460	3255460	Then the same day
3255460	3257460	The same day
3257460	3258460	Chief of the Allied Forces
3258460	3259460	Commander Michael Arthur
3259460	3260460	He ordered the Great Japanese Empire
3260460	3261460	Issued what he issued
3261460	3263460	General Order No. 1
3263460	3264460	General Order No. 1
3264460	3265460	Inside
3265460	3266460	He agreed that
3266460	3268460	The representative of the regime of the Republic of China
3268460	3269460	According to the arrangements in the order
3269460	3270460	In China
3270460	3272460	Not including Manchuria
3272460	3273460	In China
3273460	3274460	Then in Taipeng
3274460	3276460	Then 16 degrees north to north
3276460	3277460	French Indochina
3277460	3281460	Accept Japanese surrender
3281460	3282460	Then
3282460	3283460	Let's take a look
3283460	3285460	Someone just said in China
3285460	3286460	Then Taipeng
3286460	3287460	Then 16 degrees north to north
3287460	3288460	So I found out
3288460	3290460	He is a division list
3290460	3291460	So it means
3291460	3293460	Taipeng is not part of China
3293460	3294460	Then China
3294460	3295460	It does not include Manchuria
3295460	3296460	Then why is it planned like this
3296460	3297460	Because at that time Manchuria
3297460	3299460	Is handed over to the Soviet Union
3299460	3301460	To be responsible
3301460	3302460	Then go to surrender
3302460	3304460	Then occupy
3304460	3306460	Then October 25, 1945
3306460	3307460	This is Chiang Kai-shek
3307460	3308460	He sent the representative of the surrender
3308460	3309460	Chen Yi
3309460	3310460	To the Taipei Public Security Hall
3310460	3312460	Hold the Allied Surrender Ceremony
3312460	3314460	But he held this
3314460	3315460	When the surrender ceremony
3315460	3317460	He did not say that this is
3317460	3319460	The Allied Forces came to surrender
3319460	3320460	He said this is called
3320460	3322460	Taiwan restoration
3322460	3323460	That
3323460	3324460	At that time he
3324460	3326460	The Republic of China regime
3326460	3327460	Here in Taiwan
3327460	3328460	Established a
3328460	3329460	Occupation agency
3329460	3330460	It's called
3330460	3332460	Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency
3332460	3334460	Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency
3334460	3336460	Add the three words of Taiwan Provincial
3336460	3338460	That because
3338460	3339460	Actually this
3339460	3340460	At this time
3340460	3342460	Taiwan is just
3342460	3343460	Allied Forces
3343460	3344460	Military occupation
3344460	3345460	That is to say, it is not really
3345460	3347460	Return to the Republic of China
3347460	3348460	The sovereignty did not really
3348460	3350460	Return to the Republic of China
3350460	3351460	That
3351460	3353460	Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency
3353460	3355460	In fact, it represents the Allied Forces
3355460	3356460	To Taiwan and Penghu
3356460	3358460	Occupation
3358460	3359460	But because
3359460	3360460	The Republic of China is thinking
3360460	3361460	Anyway, that
3361460	3362460	The Cairo Times said that
3362460	3363460	Taiwan and Penghu
3363460	3364460	After Japan surrendered
3364460	3366460	Will return to the Republic of China
3366460	3367460	So he just
3367460	3368460	A little bit like
3368460	3369460	Before and after
3369460	3370460	A little bit like
3370460	3371460	Five tickets after getting on the bus
3371460	3373460	So he just
3373460	3374460	Established the so-called
3374460	3375460	Administrative Officer Agency
3375460	3376460	Then add Taiwan Provincial in front
3376460	3377460	That goes with that
3377460	3378460	Taiwan Guangfu
3378460	3381460	That
3381460	3383460	January 12, 1946
3383460	3384460	The Republic of China regime
3384460	3385460	He issued
3385460	3386460	Administrative order
3386460	3387460	Then restore Taiwan Penghu
3387460	3388460	Well-known
3388460	3390460	Republic of China nationality
3390460	3391460	That
3391460	3392460	Britain and the United States
3392460	3393460	In this place
3393460	3394460	He protested
3394460	3395460	He said because of Taiwan Penghu sovereignty
3395460	3396460	At this time
3396460	3397460	Still belong to Japan
3397460	3398460	So you have to say
3398460	3399460	Britain and the United States are clear
3399460	3400460	He said there was no Taiwan Guangfu
3400460	3401460	This kind of thing
3401460	3402460	No 18
3402460	3403460	December 15, 1945
3403460	3404460	No Taiwan Guangfu
3404460	3405460	This kind of thing
3405460	3406460	Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty
3406460	3407460	In 1942
3407460	3408460	Still belong to Japan
3408460	3409460	So they said
3409460	3411460	You can't be in the Republic of China
3411460	3412460	Just like this
3412460	3413460	Directly to the occupation
3413460	3415460	People's nationality
3415460	3416460	But the Republic of China
3416460	3419460	He continues
3419460	3420460	I do what I do
3420460	3421460	So anyway
3421460	3422460	He still does
3422460	3423460	But in international law
3423460	3424460	In fact, at that time
3424460	3425460	Taiwanese people
3425460	3427460	Taiwan and Penghu
3427460	3429460	Residents
3429460	3430460	They
3430460	3431460	In international law
3431460	3432460	He still has
3432460	3433460	Still have
3433460	3434460	Great Japanese Empire
3434460	3438460	Is the nationality of Japan
3438460	3439460	But at this time
3439460	3440460	They have one more
3440460	3442460	The so-called Republic of China nationality
3442460	3443460	So at that time
3443460	3444460	Taipeng resident
3444460	3446460	Double nationality
3446460	3449460	Everyone has two nationalities
3449460	3450460	Then
3450460	3452460	On February 28, 1947
3452460	3453460	Then
3453460	3455460	Then all the way to the same April
3455460	3457460	On February 28, the Great Lusha
3457460	3459460	This thing
3459460	3461460	In fact, here we can know
3461460	3463460	Say
3463460	3464460	In fact, here
3464460	3466460	What happened
3466460	3467460	It's definitely not the government
3467460	3469460	With his name
3469460	3470460	Is a national government
3470460	3472460	With his people
3472460	3473460	Conflict
3473460	3475460	It's not the case
3475460	3477460	The situation here is
3477460	3478460	A
3478460	3480460	Occupation
3480460	3481460	In
3481460	3482460	Occupation of the victorious country
3482460	3484460	On the territory of the defeated country
3484460	3486460	The act of slaughtering the people of the defeated country
3486460	3488460	This is definitely not what
3488460	3490460	It's not an official-civilian conflict
3490460	3491460	It's not an official-civilian conflict
3491460	3492460	This is
3492460	3494460	Cross-national slaughter
3497460	3499460	Because after the February 28 incident
3499460	3501460	This
3501460	3502460	The people of Taiwan are of course
3502460	3504460	For this
3504460	3505460	The regime of the Republic of China
3505460	3506460	Very dissatisfied with the situation here in Taiwan
3506460	3507460	Then they also made a request
3507460	3510460	Request that the governor-general of Taiwan province
3510460	3511460	Require him to be re-elected
3511460	3513460	Become the provincial government of Taiwan
3513460	3515460	Because he thinks
3515460	3517460	Chen Yi is like another
3517460	3519460	Like the Governor-General of Taiwan
3519460	3520460	That
3520460	3521460	The regime of the Republic of China
3521460	3522460	Later on April 22
3522460	3525460	When it was
3525460	3527460	Re-elected the provincial government of Taiwan
3527460	3528460	That
3528460	3529460	On May 17, the provincial government of Taiwan
3529460	3531460	Officially operated
3531460	3532460	Then in front of this
3532460	3536460	I want to talk about it
3536460	3538460	Re-elect the governor-general of Taiwan province
3538460	3539460	Re-elected
3539460	3540460	Re-elected the provincial government of Taiwan
3540460	3542460	This is actually
3542460	3544460	The requirements that the people of Taiwan put forth
3544460	3546460	This is the requirements that the people of Taiwan put forth
3546460	3547460	It means that the people of Taiwan
3547460	3548460	At that time
3548460	3550460	They think they are
3550460	3552460	Citizens of the Republic of China
3552460	3553460	And don't think they are
3553460	3556460	People occupying the land
3556460	3558460	So they will make such a request
3558460	3559460	So to some extent
3559460	3560460	It means that I am Chinese
3560460	3562460	So
3562460	3565460	So this is actually a choice
3565460	3566460	This is a choice
3566460	3568460	The result of this choice
3568460	3570460	Caused a big problem
3570460	3571460	OK
3571460	3572460	On May 17, 1947
3572460	3574460	The provincial government of Taiwan officially operated
3574460	3577460	On October 1, 1949
3577460	3579460	The government of the People's Republic of China
3579460	3580460	Witness
3580460	3582460	I don't want to talk about witnessing
3582460	3583460	Witness
3583460	3584460	Because actually in this place
3584460	3585460	What really happened
3585460	3587460	Is not to establish another country
3587460	3591460	But another government
3591460	3592460	That also started on this day
3592460	3595460	On October 1, 1949
3595460	3596460	China
3596460	3598460	There is a two-party regime
3598460	3600460	There are two regimes under China
3600460	3601460	Republic of China regime
3601460	3604460	With the People's Republic of China regime
3604460	3605460	These two regimes
3605460	3606460	Began to fight
3606460	3609460	Who is the representative government of China
3609460	3611460	That has been fighting to this day
3611460	3612460	Keep fighting to this day
3612460	3614460	Still fighting to this day
3614460	3615460	Some people may think
3615460	3616460	No
3616460	3617460	Now the government of the Republic of China
3617460	3619460	Isn't it the government of Taiwan?
3619460	3620460	Where is he fighting this thing?
3620460	3621460	In fact, there is
3621460	3622460	Why not
3622460	3624460	Because we look at this before
3624460	3626460	In 2017
3626460	3628460	Panama
3628460	3631460	He changed to recognize the People's Republic of China regime
3631460	3633460	Is the Chinese representative government
3633460	3634460	Of course, Taiwan is writing here
3634460	3637460	What is Taiwan-Panamanian diplomatic relations?
3637460	3639460	But we look at that time
3639460	3641460	Republic of China regime
3641460	3642460	What does his Ministry of Foreign Affairs say?
3642460	3643460	He said
3643460	3645460	Republic of China regime
3645460	3647460	Between Panama
3647460	3648460	The diplomatic relations between the two countries
3648460	3651460	More than a century
3651460	3652460	How does this century count?
3652460	3654460	When did it start?
3654460	3657460	Counting from 1910
3657460	3658460	This is very interesting
3658460	3664460	If the Republic of China regime is not China
3664460	3666460	How could you
3666460	3667460	If it's really Taiwan
3667460	3669460	How could you be with Panama
3669460	3671460	More than a century of diplomatic relations
3672460	3673460	Because in 1910
3673460	3675460	Taiwan is the territory of Japan
3675460	3677460	So it's impossible for Taiwan to establish diplomatic relations with Panama
3677460	3679460	So in 1910
3679460	3680460	It must be China
3680460	3681460	And the point is
3681460	3682460	In 1910
3682460	3683460	The Republic of China has not appeared yet
3683460	3685460	Still the Qing Empire
3685460	3686460	So we know
3686460	3688460	The Republic of China is the Qing Empire
3688460	3689460	So he just counted like this
3689460	3692460	Then the Republic of China is China
3692460	3693460	So from here we can know
3693460	3696460	The Republic of China regime says itself is Taiwan
3696460	3698460	This is actually a big question mark
3698460	3699460	Republic of China government
3699460	3700460	Until now
3700460	3702460	It's still so determined
3702460	3703460	It's still so determined
3703460	3708460	In fact, the Republic of China regime
3708460	3709460	It's all like this
3709460	3710460	Look at him
3710460	3711460	It's all like this
3711460	3713460	There is no diplomatic country
3713460	3714460	China
3714460	3715460	This thing
3715460	3717460	Take it from him
3717460	3718460	There is still China
3718460	3719460	Where is this attribute
3719460	3720460	OK
3720460	3721460	it is good
3721460	3723460	On December 8, 1949
3723460	3724460	Because of this
3724460	3726460	Domestic relations
3726460	3728460	Do you have any questions?
3728460	3729460	No no
3729460	3730460	I don't have a question
3730460	3732460	Let's pause here for a moment
3732460	3734460	Just to this
3734460	3739460	Before the establishment of the People's Republic of China
3739460	3741460	Because there are a lot of historical facts here
3741460	3742460	quite a lot
3742460	3743460	Let's stop here
3743460	3746460	Before the establishment of the People's Republic of China
3746460	3748460	Does anyone have any questions?
3748460	3750460	Do you want to ask?
3754460	3756460	I can ask
3756460	3757460	You say
3757460	3758460	I just
3758460	3760460	I am a historian
3760460	3762460	Then I also read some
3762460	3764460	Some questions about international law
3764460	3765460	Then of course
3765460	3767460	I haven't talked about the key part yet
3767460	3770460	Is the 1952 Sanhok Agreement
3770460	3772460	I look forward to how you will interpret that thing
3772460	3774460	But I think so far
3774460	3775460	I heard a question
3775460	3778460	Is that when you first defined the international law
3778460	3779460	There are three
3779460	3782460	It was just mentioned by Yan Yong
3782460	3784460	Then you put Taiwan in the third
3784460	3787460	He is just a full-time independent unit
3787460	3788460	Instead of a country
3788460	3790460	If your definition is like that
3790460	3792460	In fact, you are still discussing
3792460	3793460	That is to say
3793460	3795460	You try to put the regime of the Republic of China
3795460	3796460	Kick out of Taiwan
3796460	3799460	Then think that the people of Taiwan can decide for themselves
3799460	3802460	The government of the Republic of China is just one of the exiled regimes
3802460	3803460	That is unreasonable
3803460	3804460	Because of your own
3804460	3805460	Your own
3805460	3808460	The original assumption is that Taiwan is not a country
3808460	3811460	If your original assumption is like that
3811460	3812460	That is to say
3812460	3815460	Taiwan can't get out of the Republic of the People's Republic of China
3815460	3818460	Can't skip the Republic of the People's Republic of China
3818460	3819460	Then talk to yourself
3819460	3820460	I can be independent
3820460	3822460	What can I do about this
3822460	3824460	Do you understand
3824460	3825460	Do you understand the mistake
3825460	3827460	Ah, I think you
3827460	3829460	This inference seems a bit strange
3829460	3832460	Because why would you go to the Republic of China
3832460	3833460	There is no way to escape
3833460	3835460	It has nothing to do with him
3835460	3837460	Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I just heard it
3837460	3838460	The feeling is the first one
3838460	3839460	The first step is to say
3840460	3843460	I want to make sure that we are on the same page
3843460	3847460	You think Taiwan's current situation is not a sovereign state
3847460	3848460	Right
3848460	3850460	That's because it's all the way down
3850460	3852460	The result is that Taiwan is not a country
3852460	3853460	So I will
3853460	3854460	That is
3854460	3855460	I just said earlier
3855460	3856460	Why is Taiwan not a country
3856460	3858460	I said I would talk about it later
3858460	3859460	Oh, so
3859460	3861460	It's not that I make an assumption first
3861460	3862460	No, no
3862460	3864460	Is that I push it all the way
3864460	3865460	Because in the end it will be made
3865460	3866460	I will tell you that the whole way
3866460	3868460	There will be a conclusion
3868460	3869460	And the conclusion is
3869460	3870460	Taiwan is not a country
3870460	3872460	But Taiwan is really a
3872460	3874460	A place of independent operation
3874460	3876460	So I put this thing on
3876460	3877460	That is to say, this is
3877460	3879460	A political entity mentioned in the International Law
3879460	3880460	Something that will appear
3880460	3883460	Because Taiwan is really a political entity
3883460	3885460	Participating in international society
3888460	3890460	It doesn't matter if you continue
3890460	3892460	Because of that 1952
3892460	3893460	The San Francisco Treaty
3893460	3894460	I think it's more critical
3894460	3895460	I think
3895460	3897460	How to explain that
3898460	3899460	Because I think it's quite interesting
3899460	3901460	Because I'm talking about this here
3901460	3902460	The point is
3902460	3904460	Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to who
3906460	3907460	Because Taiwan's sovereignty
3907460	3908460	Our sovereignty
3908460	3909460	Because it says here
3909460	3910460	Here
3910460	3911460	Taiwan's sovereignty is not yet
3911460	3912460	Belong to any
3912460	3913460	Still in Japan
3913460	3915460	Still in Japan
3918460	3919460	Actually, I think this question is good
3919460	3920460	But that's why
3920460	3921460	The reason I stopped here
3921460	3923460	This is what I will talk about later
3923460	3925460	So before this
3925460	3927460	About any historical events
3927460	3929460	Do you have any questions?
3930460	3931460	Because what Kiki said
3931460	3933460	With the next thing to talk about
3934460	3936460	Because that will be answered later
3936460	3937460	That will be answered later
3937460	3938460	I'm sorry
3938460	3941460	The part where someone left a message
3941460	3942460	Let me read it for him
3942460	3943460	I want to ask
3943460	3945460	Why is the Kinmen Mazu not in
3945460	3947460	In your definition of Taiwan
3949460	3950460	This will be talked about later
3950460	3951460	Will be talked about later, right?
3951460	3952460	But actually I will say
3952460	3953460	A simple truth
3953460	3954460	That is
3954460	3955460	Because the Kinmen Mazu
3955460	3957460	Never been
3957460	3959460	Conceded by China
3961460	3963460	The Kinmen Mazu has always been in China
3965460	3968460	So its historical direction
3968460	3971460	It's different from Taiwan
3971460	3973460	From 1895
3973460	3974460	There is a big difference
3974460	3976460	Yes, it was in 1895
3976460	3979460	Taiwan and Penghu were conceded to Japan
3979460	3980460	So these two places
3980460	3981460	After the defeat of Japan
3981460	3983460	The problem of transfer
3983460	3986460	It's different from the Kinmen Mazu
3986460	3987460	Because the Kinmen Mazu
3987460	3990460	It is inherited by the Manchurian government
3990460	3992460	The Republic of China government
3992460	3993460	Then the Republic of China government
3993460	3995460	Later became an exile government
3995460	3996460	So come to Taiwan
3996460	3997460	The Kinmen Mazu
3997460	3998460	Its sovereignty has always been
3998460	3999460	Belongs to the Republic of China government
3999460	4000460	But Taiwan
4000460	4001460	Because in 1895
4001460	4003460	There was a regime transfer
4003460	4004460	Is to transfer to Japan
4004460	4006460	Then after the defeat of Japan
4006460	4007460	Gave up this land
4007460	4009460	So Taiwan and Penghu will have problems
4009460	4010460	Kinmen Mazu has no problem
4010460	4012460	You secretly finished my thing
4012460	4014460	Do you want to come and talk
4014460	4015460	But anyway
4015460	4017460	But I think this place should be a little bit
4017460	4018460	Because I'll talk about it later
4018460	4020460	Because it's not actually
4020460	4022460	Sovereignty does not belong to the Republic of China
4022460	4024460	But belongs to China
4024460	4026460	Let's put it this way
4026460	4028460	Because when
4028460	4030460	We are talking about this part of sovereignty
4030460	4031460	Sovereignty belongs to
4031460	4033460	It must be a country
4033460	4035460	The Republic of China
4035460	4037460	It's actually in
4037460	4038460	People's Republic of China
4038460	4039460	Sovereignty appears
4039460	4041460	A state of two regimes under China
4041460	4043460	When
4043460	4044460	At this time
4044460	4045460	Actually the problem is
4045460	4046460	That is to say
4046460	4047460	That part of the territory
4047460	4048460	Anyway, the territory of China
4048460	4050460	Always the territory of China
4050460	4051460	But
4051460	4052460	Unless there is
4052460	4053460	Unless there are other changes
4053460	4056460	The status of the transfer of territorial sovereignty
4056460	4057460	But this
4057460	4058460	Republic of China regime
4058460	4060460	With the People's Republic of China regime
4060460	4061460	These two regimes
4061460	4062460	Who is the representative government of China
4062460	4063460	This is the problem
4063460	4065460	But Kinmen and Mazu
4065460	4066460	Always
4066460	4068460	Always belong to the territory of China
4068460	4069460	In other words
4069460	4070460	Republic of China
4070460	4071460	It's not a
4071460	4072460	It's not a separate
4072460	4074460	People's Republic of China
4074460	4075460	country
4075460	4076460	They are a
4076460	4078460	Two regimes in a country
4078460	4079460	Two
4079460	4081460	Who is the representative government of the government
4081460	4082460	regime
4082460	4083460	So it's always been like this
4083460	4085460	Always in this state
4085460	4086460	So
4086460	4088460	Kinmen has always been the territory of China
4088460	4090460	That's also because of this reason
4090460	4092460	So it becomes
4092460	4094460	Kinmen has always been tied to China
4094460	4096460	Taiwan and Penghu
4096460	4098460	There is a situation of leaving China
4098460	4100460	Now it's actually going to be discussed later
4100460	4102460	Taiwan and Penghu
4102460	4104460	Did you go back to China
4104460	4105460	Did you go back to
4105460	4107460	Become part of China's territory
4107460	4108460	This is actually
4108460	4109460	International law
4109460	4110460	Top
4110460	4111460	Issues to discuss
4111460	4113460	I think everyone is asking questions
4113460	4114460	It's almost time to break the meme
4114460	4116460	Otherwise, let's continue
4116460	4118460	Yes, let's continue
4118460	4119460	OK
4119460	4120460	it is good
4120460	4122460	That 1949
4122460	4123460	Then we know that this
4123460	4125460	Because of the international war
4125460	4126460	Then the Republic of China
4126460	4127460	The regime of the Republic of China
4127460	4129460	He passed the executive committee meeting
4129460	4130460	Decision
4130460	4132460	Then move the central government to
4132460	4133460	Taipeng
4133460	4137460	Become an exile regime
4137460	4138460	That actually
4138460	4139460	The United States
4139460	4140460	These countries
4140460	4141460	A little bit
4141460	4142460	Forget it
4142460	4143460	That is to say
4143460	4144460	This one
4144460	4145460	It was announced
4145460	4147460	It was said that Taiwan and Penghu
4147460	4148460	Anyway, sooner or later
4148460	4149460	Return to China
4149460	4150460	right
4150460	4151460	that
4151460	4152460	I don't care about him
4152460	4153460	that
4153460	4154460	In case it is said that Taipeng
4154460	4155460	If it is said that in case
4155460	4156460	That
4156460	4157460	If the CCP eats it
4157460	4159460	You just admit it
4159460	4161460	But later because of the Korean War
4161460	4162460	Just
4162460	4163460	American attitude
4163460	4164460	There are some
4164460	4165460	This
4165460	4167460	The attitude of the anti-communist country has changed
4167460	4169460	They think this
4169460	4171460	This communist country
4171460	4172460	They are now
4172460	4174460	To expand their power
4174460	4176460	That way
4176460	4177460	It's already
4177460	4178460	The country itself
4178460	4179460	Own
4180460	4182460	The uprising between the people
4182460	4184460	Or the form of revolution
4184460	4185460	In addition
4185460	4186460	There is also this
4186460	4188460	Is to use force to invade
4188460	4189460	So they think
4189460	4191460	This is unacceptable
4191460	4192460	So they think
4192460	4193460	No way
4193460	4194460	In this place
4194460	4196460	I think the communist country
4196460	4197460	Must be used
4197460	4198460	In a more powerful way
4198460	4199460	To fight him
4199460	4200460	So at that time
4200460	4201460	They just
4201460	4202460	A conclusion
4202460	4203460	That is to say
4203460	4204460	Taiwan and Penghu can't fall
4204460	4206460	Communists
4206460	4207460	So at that time
4207460	4208460	They just
4208460	4209460	Maybe a
4209460	4210460	The so-called Taiwan Strait
4210460	4212460	Neutralization Declaration
4212460	4213460	At this time
4213460	4214460	He actually said
4214460	4215460	That is to say
4215460	4216460	Taiwan and Penghu
4216460	4217460	This part of the sovereignty
4217460	4218460	This question
4218460	4219460	This has not been decided yet
4219460	4220460	This has to be solved
4220460	4221460	Wait until
4221460	4223460	After signing a contract with Japan
4223460	4224460	Then decide
4224460	4225460	That's what they think
4225460	4227460	Or wait for the Korean War
4227460	4229460	After the end of the Korean War
4229460	4232460	Decide again
4232460	4233460	But later
4233460	4234460	Of course
4234460	4237460	There are some changes
4237460	4238460	That
4238460	4240460	On September 8, 1951
4240460	4242460	Japan and 48 allies
4242460	4243460	Members
4243460	4245460	Signed the San Francisco Treaty
4245460	4246460	At this time
4246460	4249460	When signing the San Francisco Treaty
4249460	4250460	China
4250460	4252460	There is no
4252460	4253460	Signed
4253460	4254460	Of course
4254460	4256460	A very important reason is because
4256460	4257460	In the end
4257460	4258460	China
4258460	4259460	Which regime
4259460	4260460	To represent the government
4260460	4262460	To represent China
4262460	4263460	This
4263460	4264460	Allies
4264460	4266460	There is a dispute between the members
4266460	4267460	Like the United States
4267460	4269460	I feel like I have to ask the Republic of China to come
4269460	4270460	Like the Soviet Union
4270460	4271460	He felt like
4271460	4273460	There should be the People's Republic of China
4273460	4274460	regime
4274460	4275460	Everyone is arguing
4275460	4276460	Irreconcilable
4276460	4277460	So in the end
4277460	4278460	China is not
4278460	4279460	No
4279460	4281460	Signed the San Francisco Treaty
4281460	4282460	But in the San Francisco Treaty
4282460	4283460	There is a special
4283460	4285460	Part of China's power
4285460	4286460	There are some
4286460	4287460	Some
4287460	4288460	Conditions
4288460	4291460	In the second B of the San Francisco Treaty
4291460	4292460	He is clear
4292460	4293460	That is to say
4293460	4294460	Japan gives up the right to Taiwan Strait
4294460	4296460	Rights and demands
4296460	4298460	This is a complete
4298460	4300460	A way to give up the sovereignty of the Taiwan Strait
4300460	4301460	Ok
4301460	4302460	But he did not point out
4302460	4304460	Who is the owner of the sovereignty of the Taiwan Strait?
4304460	4306460	So this is in
4306460	4308460	The so-called status of Taiwan is not set
4308460	4309460	This legal basis
4309460	4312460	The basis of the International Law is completed
4312460	4313460	Before this
4313460	4315460	For example, on June 25, 1950
4315460	4317460	Taiwan's status is not set
4317460	4318460	This position comes out
4318460	4319460	Actually
4319460	4320460	Because at that time
4320460	4322460	In fact, Taiwan and Penghu
4322460	4324460	Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to Japan
4324460	4325460	Just say
4325460	4326460	At that time
4326460	4327460	In fact, Truman meant
4327460	4328460	That is to say
4328460	4329460	Taiwan and Penghu
4329460	4330460	The status of the future
4330460	4332460	Not sure yet
4332460	4333460	That's just
4333460	4335460	This is in the San Francisco Treaty
4335460	4336460	Inside
4336460	4337460	In the second B
4337460	4338460	Directly put
4338460	4339460	The status of Taiwan and Penghu
4339460	4341460	Is not set
4341460	4343460	This legal basis
4343460	4345460	Set it up
4345460	4347460	So through this treaty
4347460	4348460	Inside this clause
4348460	4349460	Inside Japan
4350460	4352460	Then there is no designation
4352460	4353460	Who will accept
4353460	4354460	This one
4354460	4355460	Let Taiwan and Penghu
4355460	4356460	The final disposal
4356460	4357460	In a
4357460	4359460	Uncertain state
4359460	4360460	On the International Law
4360460	4361460	Taiwan and Penghu
4361460	4363460	The status is in an uncertain situation
4363460	4365460	In fact, in the San Francisco Treaty
4365460	4366460	It's not just Taiwan and Penghu
4366460	4367460	It's like this
4367460	4369460	There are others like
4369460	4370460	The West Shaanxi Islands
4370460	4372460	The South Shaanxi Islands
4372460	4373460	Then
4373460	4375460	And Japan
4375460	4377460	There were some at that time
4377460	4379460	There will be some
4379460	4380460	Tendao Islands
4380460	4381460	Kuye Islands
4381460	4383460	These places in the south
4383460	4385460	In fact, they are all in the same form
4385460	4387460	To standardize
4387460	4388460	So basically
4388460	4389460	All belong to the so-called status
4389460	4390460	To a certain state
4390460	4391460	Unless later
4391460	4393460	There are other special disposals
4393460	4395460	Taiwan and Penghu are not
4395460	4396460	OK
4396460	4397460	The second F below
4397460	4398460	I told you
4398460	4399460	He said to Mingding
4399460	4400460	The part of the South Shaanxi and the West Shaanxi
4400460	4401460	Japan is also in the same way
4401460	4402460	To give up
4402460	4403460	So this part is
4403460	4404460	Japan gave up
4404460	4406460	The sovereignty of these places
4406460	4409460	Absolutely give up
4409460	4410460	That was in 1951
4410460	4411460	On November 19
4411460	4412460	Japan's Yuren Emperor
4412460	4414460	According to the request of the Japanese Cabinet
4414460	4417460	To complete the certification of the San Francisco Treaty
4417460	4418460	Then I'm here
4418460	4420460	The reason for this particular point
4420460	4422460	Because
4422460	4424460	To some people
4424460	4425460	I'm still arguing now
4425460	4426460	That is to say
4426460	4427460	Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty
4427460	4429460	Still belong to Japan
4429460	4430460	That
4430460	4431460	Their claim is
4431460	4432460	Because of that
4432460	4433460	The San Francisco Treaty
4433460	4434460	Is
4434460	4435460	Signed by the Japanese government
4435460	4436460	Not the Japanese emperor
4436460	4437460	Signed
4437460	4438460	So it doesn't count
4438460	4439460	Then I'm here
4439460	4440460	Special mention
4440460	4441460	That is to say
4441460	4442460	The Japanese emperor has already certified
4442460	4443460	San Francisco Treaty
4443460	4444460	So he has already recognized
4444460	4445460	So the San Francisco Treaty
4445460	4447460	To give up the Taiwan-Penghu sovereignty
4447460	4449460	The Japanese emperor has already recognized
4449460	4451460	So Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty
4451460	4453460	No longer belong to Japan
4453460	4455460	That
4455460	4456460	In 1952
4456460	4457460	On April 19
4457460	4458460	Japanese Justice
4458460	4459460	Sorry
4459460	4460460	You say
4460460	4462460	Can I ask a question?
4462460	4463460	You say
4464460	4465460	You said here
4465460	4466460	Hey
4466460	4468460	San Francisco Treaty
4468460	4470460	China has no money
4470460	4471460	Then my question is
4471460	4472460	That way
4472460	4474460	Does this contract still count?
4474460	4476460	Or is this kind of contract
4476460	4477460	Is to
4477460	4479460	Big
4479460	4480460	I don't know how to
4480460	4482460	How does this contract work?
4482460	4483460	If there is one
4483460	4484460	From Mongolia
4484460	4486460	This contract is still valid
4486460	4487460	Thank you
4487460	4488460	OK
4488460	4489460	it is good
4489460	4490460	Let's talk about it now
4490460	4491460	San Francisco Treaty
4491460	4492460	San Francisco Treaty
4492460	4494460	It actually means this
4494460	4495460	because
4495460	4496460	The purpose of the contract
4496460	4497460	Is to end
4497460	4501460	The state of war between countries
4501460	4503460	So in San Francisco Treaty
4503460	4504460	Inside
4504460	4505460	Every signed country
4505460	4507460	Every signed member
4507460	4511460	Are the countries that have fought with Japan before
4511460	4512460	So San Francisco Treaty
4512460	4513460	Actually
4513460	4514460	Although it is Japan
4514460	4516460	Signed with so many countries
4516460	4517460	But actually
4517460	4518460	He
4518460	4520460	What I really want to say is
4520460	4521460	This
4521460	4523460	48 countries
4523460	4526460	Have signed a contract with Japan
4526460	4527460	That
4527460	4528460	The effect of this contract is
4528460	4529460	Happened in Japan
4529460	4530460	With
4530460	4533460	Between each signed country
4533460	4535460	Is the effect of individual establishment
4535460	4537460	Individual establishment effect
4537460	4538460	So
4538460	4539460	It's the United Nations
4539460	4540460	Not a
4540460	4541460	It's not like a company
4541460	4542460	Something like a judge
4542460	4543460	It is a
4543460	4544460	Individual
4544460	4545460	Gather
4545460	4546460	So it's like
4546460	4548460	When we sign a contract
4548460	4549460	San Francisco Treaty
4549460	4550460	Effective in Japan
4550460	4551460	With
4551460	4552460	Every
4552460	4553460	Signed
4553460	4554460	Between countries
4554460	4555460	That did not sign
4555460	4556460	That's the contract
4556460	4558460	It doesn't work for that country
4558460	4560460	But it won't affect
4560460	4561460	Signed
4561460	4562460	The country with the contract
4562460	4564460	Efficiency between Japan
4564460	4566460	and so
4566460	4567460	In this place
4567460	4568460	San Francisco Treaty
4568460	4569460	Itself
4569460	4570460	When it works
4570460	4571460	Is
4571460	4574460	All countries that have signed and approved
4574460	4576460	This contract is effective
4576460	4577460	That
4577460	4578460	Not because
4578460	4579460	Which one
4579460	4581460	San Francisco members did not sign
4581460	4583460	Then the whole contract will be invalid
4583460	4584460	Or there is no way to work
4584460	4585460	because
4585460	4587460	The international law
4587460	4588460	Basically speaking
4588460	4591460	Between two countries
4591460	4592460	Established
4592460	4594460	one
4594460	4596460	It's a contract relationship
4596460	4597460	So
4597460	4599460	Will not be affected by another country
4599460	4601460	Is there a contract
4601460	4603460	Unless they are in today
4603460	4604460	In the contract
4604460	4605460	In the contract
4605460	4606460	Directly say
4606460	4608460	Must have someone
4608460	4609460	To sign
4609460	4610460	Must have someone
4610460	4611460	Approve
4611460	4612460	This
4612460	4613460	The contract is effective
4613460	4614460	Otherwise
4614460	4615460	Basically speaking
4615460	4616460	Established in
4616460	4618460	Every
4618460	4619460	Signed between countries
4619460	4621460	Any other country
4621460	4622460	No money
4622460	4624460	Does not affect the efficiency of the contract
4624460	4625460	In fact, in this place
4625460	4627460	San Francisco Treaty
4627460	4628460	That
4628460	4629460	San Francisco member
4629460	4630460	Not only China
4630460	4632460	The Soviet Union did not sign
4632460	4633460	The Soviet Union is actually today
4633460	4635460	Have not signed a peace treaty with Japan
4635460	4636460	Peace Treaty
4636460	4637460	From the Soviet Union to today
4637460	4639460	Have not signed a peace treaty with Japan
4639460	4641460	That
4641460	4642460	Wait a minute
4642460	4643460	Because I don't quite understand
4643460	4645460	What is the contract for?
4645460	4647460	Is to end the war between
4647460	4649460	End the war between the country and the country
4649460	4650460	The state of war
4650460	4651460	Then there is
4651460	4653460	Determine the compensation between countries
4653460	4655460	So
4655460	4656460	I can understand
4656460	4657460	So this contract
4657460	4659460	As long as Japan unilaterally recognizes it
4659460	4660460	From each country
4660460	4661460	Can complete
4661460	4662460	No country
4662460	4664460	Does it matter to sign?
4664460	4665460	No
4665460	4666460	Signed country
4666460	4667460	Signed country
4667460	4668460	To end
4668460	4670460	The war between him and Japan
4670460	4671460	If you don't sign
4671460	4672460	War
4672460	4673460	Will continue to exist
4673460	4674460	So
4674460	4675460	So that means
4675460	4676460	China is now
4676460	4677460	Theoretically still
4677460	4678460	In the state of war with Japan
4678460	4679460	No
4679460	4680460	Because we haven't finished the history
4680460	4682460	Sorry
4682460	4684460	Because you don't have to sign
4684460	4685460	You want
4685460	4687460	You can sign another contract with Japan
4687460	4688460	Contract
4688460	4689460	In other words
4689460	4690460	In other words
4690460	4691460	Not just able to sign
4691460	4692460	This kind of contract
4692460	4693460	Every country
4693460	4694460	Because
4694460	4695460	Just say we are so
4695460	4696460	For example, if there are 50 people today
4696460	4697460	Right
4697460	4698460	Fifty people fight a group
4698460	4699460	Then
4699460	4701460	Fifty people fight a man
4701460	4702460	Then this person
4702460	4703460	With everyone
4703460	4705460	Everyone makes an agreement
4705460	4706460	Some people say
4706460	4707460	We use this set today
4707460	4709460	Use this set of rules
4709460	4710460	This condition
4710460	4711460	We
4711460	4712460	I made an agreement with you
4712460	4713460	In fact, he said this set
4713460	4714460	Condition
4714460	4715460	I am not satisfied
4715460	4716460	I want to talk about it again
4716460	4717460	Yes
4717460	4718460	So that's the state
4718460	4719460	You can also
4719460	4720460	With those countries that do not sign the agreement
4720460	4722460	In another contract
4722460	4723460	To end their
4723460	4724460	The state of war
4724460	4725460	Not just able to sign
4725460	4726460	Not
4726460	4727460	When you
4727460	4728460	Between two countries
4728460	4729460	You want to end the state of war
4729460	4731460	Just sign a contract
4731460	4732460	But
4732460	4733460	In the case of so many countries
4733460	4734460	Can
4734460	4735460	You can have
4735460	4736460	For example, 50
4736460	4737460	Fifty
4737460	4738460	Allied soldiers
4738460	4739460	You can sign with Japan
4739460	4740460	Is
4740460	4742460	Between 1 to 50
4742460	4744460	Between
4744460	4745460	This contract
4745460	4746460	To end this state of war
4746460	4747460	But if
4747460	4748460	For example, like here
4748460	4749460	There are 48 members
4749460	4752460	Decided to sign a treaty with Japan
4752460	4753460	That
4753460	4755460	It's these 48 countries
4755460	4756460	The state of war with Japan
4756460	4758460	Just based on the treaty to end
4758460	4759460	Ok
4759460	4761460	Then the rest did not sign
4761460	4762460	They just
4762460	4764460	In addition, use other ways to end
4764460	4766460	Maybe it's a contract
4766460	4768460	Maybe it's in other forms
4768460	4769460	For example, some are
4769460	4771460	What to publish
4771460	4773460	To replace
4773460	4774460	The same
4775460	4777460	The same
4777460	4779460	To achieve that goal
4779460	4780460	But we are talking about
4780460	4782460	48 countries
4782460	4784460	48 allied soldiers
4784460	4785460	Signed with Japan
4785460	4787460	In the end, only 45 were approved
4787460	4788460	That
4788460	4790460	In addition, there are those three that are not
4790460	4791460	They are actually later
4791460	4793460	Also use other ways to contact
4793460	4795460	The state of war with Japan
4795460	4796460	Correct
4796460	4797460	This is
4797460	4798460	It's quite interesting
4798460	4799460	That is to say, this one
4799460	4800460	Maybe someone will say
4800460	4802460	Is the allied forces coming together?
4802460	4803460	No
4803460	4804460	That is
4804460	4805460	Countries
4805460	4807460	Just gather together
4807460	4809460	But he did not stipulate that
4809460	4810460	Must be consistent
4810460	4812460	Then all the same action
4812460	4813460	To count
4813460	4814460	No
4814460	4815460	Each country
4815460	4817460	Is an individual right
4817460	4820460	Individuals can go to Japan to sign a treaty
4820460	4822460	This is a country with its own
4822460	4824460	That
4824460	4825460	Because of that
4825460	4826460	Uh
4826460	4827460	There is another one
4827460	4828460	This participant
4828460	4830460	He has a question
4830460	4831460	That
4831460	4832460	That is
4832460	4833460	China did not sign a treaty with Japan
4833460	4834460	And so on
4834460	4836460	This question of Taiwan
4836460	4837460	I think
4837460	4839460	This discussion is probably
4839460	4841460	Probably answered this question
4841460	4843460	Because we are a little late now
4843460	4844460	That
4844460	4845460	Uh
4845460	4846460	Let's
4846460	4847460	The user's question
4847460	4849460	If he feels that it has not been fully answered
4849460	4851460	After the speech
4851460	4852460	Ask again
4852460	4853460	Then talk about the parts that have not been answered
4853460	4854460	OK?
4854460	4855460	Then you end it first
4855460	4856460	OK
4856460	4857460	That user
4857460	4858460	Sorry
4858460	4859460	That
4860460	4861460	Because China later
4861460	4862460	Signed with Japan
4862460	4863460	Ha ha ha
4863460	4864460	OK
4864460	4865460	it is good
4865460	4866460	That
4866460	4867460	April 19, 1952
4867460	4868460	Then of course
4868460	4869460	Posted that
4869460	4870460	Private message
4870460	4871460	That message said
4871460	4872460	Taipeng resident
4872460	4873460	The expiration date of the TPP Treaty
4873460	4875460	Japanese nationality
4875460	4876460	That
4876460	4877460	TPP Treaty
4877460	4879460	April 28, 1952
4879460	4880460	So
4880460	4882460	From that day on
4882460	4885460	Taiwan and Penghu are no longer Japanese territory
4885460	4887460	Then the sovereignty is in an uncertain state
4887460	4888460	Then
4888460	4889460	Taipeng resident
4889460	4891460	He is no longer Japanese nationality
4891460	4892460	No more Japanese
4892460	4893460	Yes
4893460	4894460	Now there are some people in Taiwan and Penghu
4894460	4896460	There are still Japanese nationalities
4896460	4899460	This is not always understood in international law
4899460	4900460	Then let's talk about this thing now
4900460	4901460	Is
4901460	4903460	China signed a contract with Japan
4903460	4904460	That is
4904460	4905460	April 28, 1952
4905460	4907460	On the day the contract came into effect
4907460	4909460	Japan and the People's Republic of China
4909460	4912460	Signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty
4912460	4913460	What about this contract
4913460	4914460	Because Japan was there
4914460	4915460	He is
4915460	4917460	Recognize the People's Republic of China as the Chinese representative government
4917460	4919460	So at this time
4919460	4921460	The effect of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
4921460	4927460	Is to end the war between China and Japan
4927460	4931460	So although China did not sign the TPP Treaty
4931460	4932460	But
4932460	4934460	He signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty
4934460	4935460	So it's still the same
4935460	4936460	Then there is a point
4936460	4937460	In the Sino-Japanese Treaty
4937460	4938460	Article 2
4938460	4939460	He clearly stated
4939460	4943460	The two sides admitted that Japan had given up Taiwan in the TPP Treaty
4943460	4944460	Taipeng
4944460	4945460	Taipeng
4945460	4949460	The complete sovereignty of the South China Sea and the West China Sea
4949460	4950460	That's it
4950460	4951460	It's over
4951460	4953460	This is about territorial
4953460	4954460	The part of Taipeng's sovereignty
4954460	4955460	That's it
4955460	4959460	Nothing else
4959460	4961460	In fact, in this place
4961460	4963460	This second article also means
4963460	4964460	The People's Republic of China
4964460	4966460	Basically through the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
4966460	4968460	He admitted that in the Sino-Japanese Treaty
4968460	4971460	Arrangements for Taiwan's absence
4971460	4972460	In the fourth article
4972460	4977460	This includes all the treaties between China and Japan before December 9, 1941
4977460	4980460	This also includes the so-called Maguan Treaty
4980460	4982460	There will be a question later
4982460	4984460	But I will mention
4984460	4985460	Article 10
4985460	4986460	Taipeng residents and his descendants
4986460	4988460	As a citizen of the People's Republic of China
4988460	4990460	As a citizen of the People's Republic of China
4990460	4991460	But here you have to pay special attention
4991460	4992460	This is a citizen
4992460	4994460	You are not
4994460	4995460	Take you as
4995460	4996460	It's called a citizen
4996460	4998460	So in other words
4998460	5000460	In fact, Taipeng residents and his descendants
5000460	5002460	For the regime of the People's Republic of China
5002460	5004460	Actually not his citizen
5004460	5007460	He just took it as his citizen
5007460	5010460	In law
5010460	5014460	The Sino-Japanese Treaty was enacted on August 5, 1952
5014460	5015460	it is good
5015460	5017460	Then I just said before
5017460	5018460	He signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5018460	5019460	Article 10
5019460	5022460	The absence of the Sino-Japanese Treaty before December 9, 1941
5022460	5023460	All the treaties
5023460	5024460	Including the Maguan Treaty
5024460	5028460	Will Taipeng's sovereignty return to the People's Republic of China?
5028460	5030460	That Japanese side is very straightforward
5030460	5032460	It seems that in 1964
5032460	5034460	The Taiwan Treaty Bureau said directly
5034460	5035460	Jumped over
5035460	5036460	We just said
5036460	5038460	Such a treaty as Taiwan's abandonment
5038460	5039460	That is to say
5039460	5040460	Complete the abandonment of Taiwan
5040460	5041460	Once achieved the purpose
5041460	5044460	After that, it will only be effective in form
5044460	5045460	Because this is
5045460	5046460	A treaty that has been executed
5046460	5047460	Even if abandoned
5047460	5049460	Abandonment in form
5049460	5051460	The event that has been executed
5051460	5054460	Unable to return to the state of non-execution
5054460	5056460	In other words
5056460	5061460	The Maguan Treaty abandons Taiwan and Penghu to Japan
5061460	5062460	Abandoned
5062460	5063460	Completed
5063460	5065460	It's over after the transfer
5065460	5068460	After that, even if the Maguan Treaty is abolished
5068460	5069460	Taiwan and Penghu's sovereignty
5069460	5073460	Will not return to the Republic of China because of this
5073460	5075460	This is the basic principle of international law
5075460	5078460	Because it is based on the requirements of legal stability
5078460	5079460	Of course, why is this?
5079460	5081460	Because
5081460	5082460	Because in fact, between the international
5082460	5083460	Sometimes in the past
5083460	5084460	Often because of some war
5084460	5086460	There is a problem of territorial partition between each other
5086460	5089460	So the territory is partitioned
5089460	5091460	If it's just between two countries
5091460	5092460	It doesn't matter if you fight
5092460	5094460	Sometimes it will be related to the third country
5094460	5096460	Or even the fourth country, the fifth country
5096460	5097460	In this case
5097460	5098460	Your territory
5098460	5101460	A piece of territory may be partitioned in the middle
5101460	5102460	Turn around
5102460	5103460	Turn a few hands
5103460	5107460	If you are in the back
5107460	5109460	For example, if the A country and the B country fight
5109460	5110460	Then partition a piece of land
5110460	5111460	Then fight a few battles
5111460	5114460	Then the land was later transferred to the F country
5114460	5115460	Then if later
5115460	5117460	Between the A country and the B country
5117460	5121460	If the treaty on this piece of land was abolished
5121460	5124460	Assuming that you can make the territory return to its original state
5124460	5127460	Isn't the territory in the hands of the F country now?
5127460	5129460	How do you return to its original state?
5129460	5131460	So this is to say
5131460	5133460	Because it is based on the principle of legal stability
5133460	5134460	So like this
5134460	5136460	You have already
5136460	5138460	The territory has been partitioned
5138460	5139460	You can't say
5139460	5141460	Because you restore today
5141460	5142460	That is to say
5142460	5143460	This treaty
5143460	5145460	The previous treaty was abolished
5145460	5147460	Then restore to its original state
5147460	5148460	and so
5148460	5151460	After the Maguan Treaty was abolished
5151460	5152460	Then Taiwan and Hong Kong
5152460	5154460	Returned to the Republic of China
5154460	5155460	This statement
5155460	5156460	It's not correct in law
5156460	5158460	It doesn't make sense in international law
5158460	5161460	But this is one of the sayings of the Republic of China
5164460	5165460	And then in 1954
5165460	5166460	The Republic of China signed with the United States
5166460	5168460	Sino-US Joint Transparency Treaty
5168460	5169460	What about the treaty?
5169460	5171460	It was abolished on March 3
5171460	5173460	March 3 next year
5173460	5174460	Article 2 of the Treaty
5174460	5175460	Taiwan and Penghu are listed as
5175460	5177460	Territory controlled by the Republic of China
5177460	5180460	In the English version, it is Territory
5180460	5182460	In fact, Territory is mainly in this place
5182460	5185460	Is a region controlled by a regime
5185460	5188460	In the Chinese version, it is translated as territory
5188460	5191460	This is a hint of sovereignty
5191460	5193460	In fact, the Republic of China
5193460	5195460	Do things like this in many places
5195460	5197460	In fact, it's just a field
5197460	5199460	Just say where you actually control
5199460	5201460	It's not about sovereignty
5201460	5202460	Sovereignty belongs to you
5202460	5203460	But the Republic of China
5203460	5206460	He will do it in translation
5206460	5207460	Then make you feel
5207460	5209460	Yeah, does that mean sovereignty?
5209460	5211460	Belongs to the Republic of China
5211460	5213460	In fact, the United States is also very clear about this
5213460	5214460	So they are in
5214460	5216460	The Senate approved the treaty and said directly
5216460	5217460	This treaty
5217460	5219460	Will not change the status of Taiwan's legal status
5219460	5221460	Uncertain state
5223460	5225460	On December 5, 1971
5225460	5226460	The United Nations General Assembly resolution
5226460	5227460	The Republic of China regime
5227460	5229460	Listed as a representative of the Republic of China
5229460	5230460	But this resolution did not mention
5230460	5232460	Taiwan and Penghu belong to
5232460	5234460	Then expelled from the United Nations
5234460	5235460	Is the regime of the Republic of China
5235460	5237460	Not Taiwan
5237460	5238460	So someone said
5238460	5239460	Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations
5239460	5241460	This is not the case
5241460	5243460	Because Taiwan has never been
5243460	5245460	Never entered the United Nations
5245460	5249460	The Republic of China entered the United Nations in 1945
5249460	5251460	Then the Republic of China
5251460	5252460	At that time he was China
5252460	5253460	Because at that time
5253460	5254460	The regime of the People's Republic of China did not exist
5254460	5256460	Is the regime of the Republic of China
5256460	5261460	Is the government of the Republic of China
5261460	5262460	Then in 1972
5262460	5264460	On September 29, Japan changed
5264460	5267460	The regime of the People's Republic of China is the government of China
5267460	5271460	So he did not memorize the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5271460	5272460	In this case
5272460	5273460	For Japan
5273460	5276460	Taiwan and Penghu residents are no longer regarded as citizens of the Republic of China
5276460	5280460	But residents under the Taiwan Autonomous Region
5280460	5282460	In fact, this later
5282460	5284460	Extended all the way to
5284460	5286460	Just recently
5286460	5288460	We have heard some news
5288460	5289460	That is, like Japan
5289460	5292460	Now Taiwan is in Japan
5292460	5294460	If he wants to register
5294460	5296460	Or what other registration
5296460	5298460	His birthplace
5298460	5299460	Something like that
5299460	5300460	You can write Taiwan directly now
5300460	5303460	Instead of writing China
5303460	5305460	So this concept
5305460	5308460	Just came out
5308460	5309460	OK
5309460	5310460	Then in 1979
5310460	5311460	On January 1, the United States changed
5311460	5315460	The regime of the People's Republic of China is the government of China
5315460	5317460	On April 10, the same year
5317460	5319460	Taiwan Relations Act was signed
5319460	5322460	Expired on January 1, 1979
5322460	5323460	But the purpose is to maintain
5323460	5326460	Non-official relations between the United States and Taiwan Penghu residents
5326460	5329460	Then it also admitted that
5329460	5332460	The United States originally recognized the Republic of China
5332460	5333460	This thing
5333460	5335460	Now it's the Taiwan Autonomous Region
5335460	5338460	And this Autonomous Region can be replaced
5338460	5340460	Look at the part of Jinma
5340460	5343460	This award is
5343460	5345460	The point is that these places
5345460	5349460	Jinma has always been the coast island of mainland China
5349460	5352460	Then he is different from the legal status of Taiwan Penghu
5352460	5355460	Because the biggest difference is
5355460	5357460	Never been cut
5357460	5358460	Then there is no
5358460	5359460	This one behind
5359460	5364460	The dispute on the territorial settlement treaty
5364460	5366460	So Jinmen Mazu
5366460	5369460	It's always the territory of China
5369460	5371460	Then the UK is the same
5371460	5373460	Can I ask a question?
5373460	5376460	Just go back to the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5376460	5378460	I agree with your point
5378460	5381460	You said that the defeated country
5381460	5383460	Because he surrendered
5383460	5386460	So he signed the treaty
5386460	5389460	Then put the original
5389460	5391460	The original territory
5391460	5392460	Must give up
5392460	5393460	Transfer to
5393460	5395460	Give up this territory
5395460	5396460	That means
5396460	5399460	This territory will be returned to
5399460	5401460	Originally he
5401460	5403460	Occupied that country
5403460	5404460	I agree
5404460	5406460	But my question is
5406460	5408460	If according to this logic
5408460	5411460	Why did Japan sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty with the Republic of China?
5411460	5413460	When he signed the treaty
5413460	5415460	He is with all
5415460	5418460	The 48 countries that won
5418460	5419460	All signed
5419460	5421460	I said I gave up Taiwan Pengjin
5421460	5422460	I give up every one
5422460	5423460	With the United States
5423460	5424460	With France
5424460	5426460	He has such a clause
5426460	5427460	Or he is only
5427460	5431460	For the Sino-Japanese Treaty signed with the Republic of China
5431460	5432460	He also mentioned
5432460	5436460	I give up the sovereignty of Taiwan Pengjin
5436460	5438460	Then in the treaty
5438460	5439460	There is already
5439460	5441460	Including Japan's abandonment of Taiwan Pengjin
5441460	5443460	Part
5443460	5444460	So he is now
5444460	5446460	Between Japan and the Republic of China
5446460	5447460	In addition
5447460	5449460	This thing is because of China
5449460	5450460	Because at that time
5450460	5452460	China because of the issue of representative rights
5452460	5453460	So there is no way to sign
5453460	5455460	Sino-Japanese Treaty
5455460	5458460	But the war between China and Japan
5458460	5460460	Still have to end
5460460	5461460	So Japan is with
5461460	5464460	The Chinese representative government he recognized
5464460	5466460	Signed this Sino-Japanese Treaty
5466460	5468460	There is a very important part in this
5468460	5469460	Is to say
5469460	5472460	Is the part about Taiwan and Pengjin
5472460	5474460	That part about Taiwan and Pengjin
5474460	5475460	He is here
5475460	5478460	Especially with the Republic of China
5478460	5479460	Signed this thing
5479460	5480460	To say OK
5480460	5482460	Both sides admit
5482460	5484460	Japan has been in the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5484460	5486460	Did you give up this part of the sovereignty?
5486460	5487460	That's it
5487460	5489460	So actually it should be said
5489460	5490460	That is to say, for Japan
5490460	5491460	He is with all the countries
5491460	5493460	About Taiwan and Pengjin
5493460	5497460	Part of the territory
5497460	5498460	The conditions are the same
5498460	5500460	It's all Japan
5500460	5502460	Gave up the sovereignty of Taiwan Pengjin
5502460	5504460	It's all the same thing here
5504460	5505460	I have a
5505460	5506460	I have a metaphor, OK?
5506460	5508460	Because I think you are
5508460	5510460	It seems to make sense
5510460	5512460	But there is a little bit of no sense
5512460	5514460	I said it was a common sense
5514460	5516460	Suppose there is a pair
5516460	5518460	There is a
5518460	5520460	There is a person who went to rob
5520460	5522460	A robbed B's child
5522460	5524460	And then a few years later
5524460	5525460	B retaliated
5525460	5526460	Then B
5526460	5528460	He has a bigger fist
5528460	5530460	He won the war
5530460	5532460	And now
5532460	5535460	He wants to deal with this now
5535460	5537460	The thing about the kid who was robbed
5537460	5538460	He signed a contract
5538460	5539460	Then according to your statement
5539460	5541460	It's a bit like A signed
5541460	5543460	Signed this contract with B
5543460	5544460	In the contract
5544460	5546460	He just said he gave up this kid
5546460	5547460	He didn't say this kid
5547460	5549460	Must belong to B
5549460	5550460	I think you gave me this
5550460	5552460	The logic of the deduction is like that
5552460	5553460	So what I mean is
5553460	5555460	So why did he follow
5555460	5557460	So the first thing is
5557460	5559460	He signed this thing with B
5559460	5562460	A and B have such behavior
5562460	5564460	Is a
5564460	5566460	A has been established in a
5566460	5568460	Under a very special relationship
5568460	5570460	The two of them will do it again
5570460	5571460	A contract like this
5571460	5573460	No, there is no special relationship
5573460	5575460	Because in fact they are all
5575460	5577460	They are all
5577460	5579460	There is a war with Japan
5579460	5580460	So for Japan
5580460	5581460	He just wants to solve this problem
5581460	5583460	So I have to sign this
5583460	5584460	Basically
5584460	5586460	The content of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5586460	5587460	Originally
5587460	5588460	Originally
5588460	5589460	Basically the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5589460	5590460	Originally
5590460	5592460	I think
5592460	5593460	Let's leave this question
5593460	5595460	Let's discuss it in the last Q&A
5595460	5597460	Because this is more like a question of interpretation
5597460	5599460	This is not an objective fact
5599460	5601460	Just answer it
5601460	5602460	Because I think
5602460	5604460	In fact, the objective fact is also very simple
5604460	5605460	Basically
5605460	5606460	For Japan
5606460	5607460	Sino-Japanese Treaty
5607460	5608460	Why did he sign this thing
5608460	5610460	Because actually the original Sino-Japanese Treaty
5610460	5611460	The original draft is not like this
5611460	5612460	The original draft is not like this
5612460	5614460	The original content of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5614460	5616460	In fact, it is not much different from the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5616460	5618460	But then I found out
5618460	5620460	Why repeat these things
5620460	5622460	Because in the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5622460	5624460	Article 26
5624460	5626460	It directly says that Japan
5626460	5628460	In the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5628460	5629460	For example, within two years
5629460	5632460	You can sign with other countries
5632460	5634460	That is, the content of the treaty is consistent
5634460	5637460	Some other contracts that are similar to the content of the treaty
5637460	5640460	To end the state of war between each other
5640460	5641460	So for Japan
5641460	5643460	He signed this with the Republic of China
5643460	5645460	Because Japan is not only signed with the Republic of China
5645460	5646460	He also signed with India
5646460	5648460	And with
5648460	5650460	And some other countries
5650460	5652460	Also signed contracts
5652460	5653460	But when signing these contracts
5653460	5654460	In fact, it is
5654460	5656460	It's like adding up
5656460	5658460	Some of the things in the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5658460	5659460	So for Japan
5659460	5661460	He just didn't sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5661460	5663460	Or signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5663460	5665460	But no approved countries
5665460	5667460	In addition to signing the treaty
5667460	5668460	And then go
5668460	5670460	Officially confirm the state of war between each other
5670460	5671460	That's it
5671460	5672460	That
5672460	5673460	The current situation is that
5673460	5674460	Because now there is a point
5674460	5677460	Japan signed with the Republic of China today
5677460	5678460	This thing
5678460	5680460	With Japan
5680460	5681460	He signed in the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5681460	5682460	He just said
5682460	5683460	I have already made it very clear
5683460	5684460	China also admitted
5684460	5686460	This is the arrangement of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5686460	5687460	Republic of China
5687460	5688460	He also admitted
5688460	5690460	This is how the Sino-Japanese Treaty is handled
5690460	5692460	He can't do it here
5692460	5693460	Further processing
5693460	5695460	In fact, it is the Republic of China
5695460	5696460	I admit
5696460	5697460	That's it
5697460	5698460	The result is like this
5698460	5700460	I can't handle it anymore
5700460	5702460	Because Japan and the Republic of China
5702460	5704460	He can't sign anything else
5704460	5706460	Because Japan has given up
5706460	5708460	In fact, he has given up
5708460	5709460	He just told the Republic of China
5709460	5710460	He told the Republic of China
5710460	5711460	I have given up these things
5711460	5713460	You can't ask me for anything anymore
5713460	5715460	I can't give you anything
5715460	5716460	So the Republic of China said
5716460	5717460	OK, I admit
5717460	5719460	I admit that you have given up here
5719460	5720460	OK
5720460	5722460	I can't ask you for anything
5722460	5723460	You can't give me anything anymore
5723460	5724460	In Japan
5724460	5726460	Through this form
5726460	5727460	Off the hook
5727460	5728460	For example
5728460	5729460	Yes, I am already in the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5729460	5731460	I have already given up on the sovereignty of Taiwan
5731460	5733460	To the world
5733460	5734460	Then
5734460	5735460	It's not my business anymore
5735460	5736460	None of my business
5736460	5738460	Then I signed with the Republic of China today
5738460	5739460	Make it clear
5739460	5741460	Although this place is now occupied
5741460	5743460	But I have already said
5743460	5744460	I have already given up on this thing
5744460	5745460	I have already given up
5745460	5746460	It's none of my business
5746460	5748460	You can't ask me for anything
5748460	5750460	So this is actually the effect of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5750460	5751460	That is
5751460	5752460	This kind of blood
5752460	5753460	Is to let China
5753460	5755460	The Republic of China can't do anything with Japan
5755460	5757460	The Republic of China can only admit
5757460	5758460	OK
5758460	5759460	It's over like this
5759460	5761460	The situation is like this
5761460	5764460	In fact, the Republic of China also thinks
5764460	5766460	The status of Taiwan is not necessarily better
5766460	5768460	It's not because of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
5768460	5769460	Signed like this
5769460	5770460	Then I felt
5770460	5771460	Taiwan is like this
5771460	5772460	Then I went back to him again
5772460	5773460	Of course
5773460	5775460	How he talks to the Taiwanese
5775460	5776460	That's another thing
5776460	5779460	But the Republic of China is very clear about this
5780460	5781460	OK
5783460	5784460	That
5784460	5785460	So I say this conclusion
5785460	5787460	This part of Taiwan and Penghu
5787460	5788460	This is the first place in the law
5788460	5789460	The ownership of sovereignty is not decided
5789460	5791460	Does not belong to any country
5791460	5792460	But this is also special
5792460	5794460	Taiwan and Penghu are basically
5794460	5795460	Basically speaking
5795460	5797460	Before giving up in Japan
5797460	5798460	Sovereignty belongs to Japan
5798460	5800460	But it is the colonial territory of Japan
5801460	5803460	So basically speaking
5803460	5804460	After World War II
5804460	5806460	The so-called international consensus
5806460	5807460	The colonial territory is basically
5807460	5809460	To give the people of the colonial territory the right to self-determination
5809460	5811460	So from this perspective
5811460	5812460	Taiwan and Penghu
5812460	5815460	In its original status as a colonial territory
5815460	5816460	He has the right
5816460	5818460	Taiwanese citizens have the right to decide to return
5819460	5820460	That part of China
5820460	5822460	The regime of the Republic of China did not get it
5822460	5823460	The People's Republic of China regime
5823460	5825460	The regime of the Republic of China did not get it
5825460	5827460	So he can't claim
5827460	5828460	By inheriting the Republic of China
5828460	5830460	To obtain this sovereignty
5831460	5833460	Some people claim that Taiwan and Penghu
5833460	5834460	Sovereignty now belongs to the United States
5834460	5836460	But the United States is just one of the allies
5837460	5838460	There is no international document
5838460	5840460	Hand Taiwan's sovereignty over to the United States
5840460	5841460	So there is no such thing
5842460	5843460	Someone else said
5843460	5845460	Taiwan's sovereignty now belongs to the allies
5845460	5846460	This is also a joke
5846460	5847460	because
5848460	5850460	The allied forces only carry out military occupation authorization
5850460	5852460	That's the same thing in the Sino-Taiwan Treaty
5852460	5853460	Japan just gave up
5853460	5856460	Did not say that the sovereignty was transferred to the allied forces
5857460	5858460	So Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty
5858460	5860460	It will not belong to the allied forces
5860460	5861460	Someone else said
5861460	5863460	Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to the people of Taiwan
5863460	5864460	But in fact, territorial sovereignty
5864460	5866460	Only the country can claim
5866460	5867460	and so
5867460	5869460	Can't mix with national sovereignty
5871460	5872460	The current status of self-determination is
5872460	5873460	The Republic of China regime
5873460	5874460	Under the authorization of the allied forces
5874460	5876460	Established occupation self-government institutions
5876460	5877460	Taiwan's own authorities
5877460	5878460	Occupying
5878460	5879460	In governance
5881460	5883460	That allied force established
5883460	5885460	The Republic of China established this occupation self-government institution
5885460	5888460	At first it was the so-called Taiwan Provincial Executive Office
5888460	5890460	Later it became the Taiwan Provincial Government
5890460	5891460	Then later
5891460	5894460	Because of a series of new provinces
5894460	5896460	After the Dong Province and the Jin Province
5896460	5898460	The main functions and roles
5898460	5899460	Basically
5899460	5903460	Have been taken over by the central government of the Republic of China regime
5904460	5905460	So we see
5906460	5907460	It was originally the Taiwan Province
5908460	5909460	The so-called Taiwan Province of the Republic of China
5909460	5911460	Later, Taipei City became the Executive Office
5911460	5913460	The Executive Yuan directly managed
5913460	5914460	Later, Kaohsiung City came out
5914460	5916460	And now it has become a six-capital city
5917460	5918460	That basically
5918460	5922460	Some of these from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China
5922460	5924460	These so-called Executive Offices
5925460	5926460	Basically equal to the Republic of China
5926460	5928460	It has taken all its governance
5928460	5930460	In their own hands
5930460	5931460	The Taiwan Provincial Government
5931460	5932460	Basically speaking
5932460	5933460	Already
5933460	5934460	Degraded
5934460	5935460	And now
5935460	5938460	The personnel has been reorganized to the National Development and Reform Commission
5938460	5940460	So in fact, the whole Taiwan
5940460	5942460	Now the whole governance
5942460	5944460	It's the Republic of China regime itself
5944460	5945460	In operation
5946460	5947460	OK
5947460	5948460	That's basically the part of the Ma group
5948460	5950460	The rule of law has always been China
5951460	5952460	What about the governance part?
5952460	5953460	It's the Republic of China regime
5953460	5955460	It's the Chinese regime
5955460	5957460	One of the two major regimes
5957460	5958460	China
5958460	5959460	The Republic of China regime
5959460	5960460	Now it is governed
5961460	5962460	So that's the way it is
5963460	5964460	That is
5964460	5965460	To show off
5965460	5966460	It's China
5966460	5967460	It's two regimes
5967460	5968460	The two regimes have their own jurisdiction
5968460	5969460	Different ranges
5969460	5970460	These are all belong to
5970460	5971460	Mainland China
5971460	5972460	Hong Kong and Macau
5972460	5974460	The Ma group is the so-called Chinese territory
5974460	5975460	The part of the sovereign territory
5976460	5977460	That's another piece
5977460	5980460	It is the Allied Forces that authorizes the Republic of China regime
5980460	5982460	Establish the Allied Forces Occupation Organization
5982460	5984460	Then come to govern
5984460	5985460	Taiwan and Penghu
5985460	5987460	That is currently the status of the sovereign
5987460	5988460	That governance
5988460	5989460	The power comes from the Allied Forces
5989460	5991460	All the way down
5991460	5992460	That is to say
5992460	5994460	The Allied Forces were the victors
5994460	5995460	The victor
5996460	5998460	The victor is the loser
5998460	6001460	Occupy the territory
6001460	6003460	And then because of the loser
6003460	6004460	After giving up the territory
6004460	6005460	but
6005460	6008460	The final disposal of its territory is not certain
6008460	6009460	So people still maintain
6009460	6011460	A state of continued management
6011460	6013460	So this is the current legal status
6013460	6015460	Of course this is my research
6015460	6016460	That
6016460	6019460	Maybe someone has other different opinions
6019460	6020460	But basically
6020460	6021460	This is from me
6021460	6023460	I personally from the perspective of international law
6024460	6026460	The results of my research
6026460	6027460	OK
6029460	6030460	Then
6030460	6031460	Taiwan is a country
6031460	6032460	In fact, this statement
6032460	6034460	Some people think it is already
6034460	6036460	Some people say that in 1949
6036460	6038460	Taiwan is already a country
6038460	6039460	but
6039460	6040460	This is a problem
6040460	6041460	That is to say
6041460	6043460	At that time, Taiwan's sovereignty was still Japan
6043460	6045460	How do you use Taiwan to build a country
6045460	6047460	This is a very strange thing
6047460	6048460	Another year
6048460	6050460	On October 25, 1971
6050460	6051460	Also represented China in the United Nations
6051460	6054460	So if you say you built a country in 1949
6054460	6056460	That one
6056460	6057460	If it's not China
6057460	6059460	How do you represent China in the United Nations
6061460	6062460	And another thing is
6062460	6063460	With him
6063460	6064460	Build a country with China
6064460	6065460	Still regard it as China
6065460	6067460	At least before October 25, 1971
6067460	6069460	The United States was before 1979
6069460	6070460	Right?
6070460	6071460	Still think
6071460	6072460	It represents China
6072460	6073460	It's all China
6073460	6075460	Then there are people who claim that
6075460	6076460	After giving up because of Japan
6076460	6077460	Taiwan
6077460	6078460	Then it becomes an unoccupied territory
6078460	6079460	So you can occupy an unoccupied territory
6079460	6080460	Then it becomes its territory
6081460	6082460	But now there is a problem
6082460	6083460	That is to say
6083460	6084460	On the International Law
6084460	6085460	For the so-called unoccupied land
6085460	6086460	There is a strict requirement
6086460	6087460	Now the so-called unoccupied land
6087460	6091460	It is the so-called uninhabited island that can claim to occupy the unoccupied land
6091460	6092460	Or no one
6092460	6094460	Long-term residence
6094460	6095460	That place
6095460	6096460	That place will become
6096460	6097460	Unoccupied land
6097460	6098460	Appropriate object
6098460	6099460	Then we know that
6099460	6100460	In fact, Taiwan and Penghu
6100460	6104460	In fact, there are millions of people on it for a long time
6104460	6106460	Millions of people now live on it
6106460	6108460	Then there are social
6108460	6109460	Social life
6109460	6111460	Organized operation
6111460	6112460	There is economic life
6112460	6113460	So it won't be
6113460	6114460	It won't be an uninhabited island
6114460	6116460	So you can't use it
6116460	6118460	The sovereignty of the unoccupied land
6118460	6119460	The Republic of China regime
6119460	6121460	Has not yet announced the establishment of a new country
6121460	6123460	So it's all the same
6123460	6124460	Same as above
6124460	6127460	It's all the same in the United Nations
6127460	6129460	Some people say that in 1971
6129460	6131460	The Republic of China was kicked out of the United Nations
6131460	6132460	After the founding of the country
6132460	6133460	This is also very interesting
6133460	6134460	In fact, it is still the same
6134460	6136460	It has never been announced
6136460	6138460	Has not yet announced the establishment of a new country
6138460	6139460	Then
6139460	6141460	In fact, the Republic of China regime in 1979
6141460	6143460	After being kicked out of the United Nations
6143460	6144460	The so-called Republic of China
6144460	6145460	After being kicked out of the United Nations
6145460	6146460	In fact, there are many countries
6146460	6147460	Admit that he is the representative of China
6147460	6148460	Right
6148460	6149460	Like the United States
6149460	6150460	It was only changed in 1979
6150460	6151460	Panama
6151460	6153460	It was only over in 2017
6153460	6154460	Right
6154460	6156460	So there are many countries
6156460	6157460	Think he is the Chinese regime
6157460	6159460	So he never established
6159460	6162460	A new country that is different from China
6162460	6165460	Never did this thing
6165460	6166460	It's all the same
6166460	6167460	Then someone else said
6167460	6168460	In 1996
6168460	6171460	The presidential election of the Republic of China regime
6171460	6173460	So the founding of the country
6173460	6174460	This is also very interesting
6174460	6175460	Still the same
6175460	6176460	The same questions are all the same
6176460	6177460	Another one is
6177460	6178460	The candidate did not say
6178460	6180460	Announce the establishment of a new country
6180460	6182460	In 1996
6182460	6185460	The presidential election of the Republic of China regime
6185460	6186460	Li Denghui was elected
6186460	6187460	Li Denghui
6187460	6190460	At that time, the Chinese Kuomintang was the chairman
6190460	6191460	Then we all know that the Chinese Kuomintang
6191460	6194460	Is a regime that advocates unification
6195460	6199460	So the chairman of a regime that advocates unification
6199460	6201460	Elected president
6201460	6202460	How could you
6202460	6203460	Because he elected the president
6203460	6206460	Then establish a country
6206460	6208460	This is also incomprehensible
6208460	6209460	The other point is
6209460	6210460	You can't choose
6210460	6213460	The president of the A country to establish the B country
6213460	6217460	Is there such an example in history?
6217460	6219460	Then someone else said
6219460	6220460	The Chinese Kuomintang did not work before
6220460	6222460	Then change to the Democratic Party
6222460	6223460	Then someone said
6223460	6227460	In 2000, 2004, Chen Shui-bian was elected
6227460	6228460	Basically the same as before
6228460	6229460	Chen Shui-bian was elected
6229460	6232460	He did not advocate the establishment of a new country
6232460	6234460	The other important thing is
6234460	6237460	In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou was elected president
6237460	6239460	If today
6239460	6242460	Chen Shui-bian elected the president of the Republic of China
6242460	6245460	He will represent the establishment of the Republic of Taiwan
6245460	6248460	Today, when Ma Ying-jeou was elected president
6248460	6250460	What about the previous Republic of Taiwan?
6251460	6252460	Is there such a thing as extinction?
6252460	6254460	So this is a very strange statement
6254460	6255460	It is impossible for you to say
6255460	6257460	Which one to choose
6257460	6259460	To be the leader of a certain regime
6259460	6261460	To establish another country
6261460	6263460	That is incomprehensible
6263460	6264460	Then someone said
6264460	6266460	Because there is no complete governance
6266460	6268460	So Chen Shui-bian has no complete governance
6268460	6269460	So that doesn't count
6269460	6272460	In 2016, Tsai Ing-wen took over
6272460	6273460	Taiwan is the same
6273460	6274460	It's all the same in front
6274460	6276460	These are all the same problems
6276460	6277460	Have appeared
6277460	6278460	In addition, by taking over
6278460	6279460	To establish another country
6279460	6281460	There is no potential
6283460	6285460	Then this is what I just said
6285460	6287460	Panama changed its name to the People's Republic of China regime
6287460	6289460	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China is still talking about
6289460	6291460	The two countries are more than a century apart
6291460	6293460	So even if Tsai Ing-wen's regime
6293460	6295460	Tsai Ing-wen as president
6295460	6296460	This regime of the People's Republic of China
6296460	6297460	He is still
6297460	6300460	The same relationship with other countries
6300460	6301460	All the way back to China
6301460	6303460	Relations with other countries
6303460	6305460	So it won't be another country
6306460	6308460	So Taiwan is not a country yet
6310460	6312460	Then this situation is more direct
6312460	6315460	For example, the so-called diplomatic countries of the People's Republic of China
6315460	6316460	This is Fan Ligang
6316460	6317460	There is that website below
6317460	6319460	This is actually
6319460	6321460	On the official website of Fan Ligang
6321460	6323460	The national flag of the People's Republic of China is written on the side of China
6324460	6326460	Now many people say this is the national flag of Taiwan
6328460	6329460	Then another example is Honduras
6329460	6330460	It's the same
6330460	6331460	China
6331460	6332460	Taiwan is written behind
6332460	6333460	Taiwan is written behind
6333460	6336460	What does Taiwan mean?
6336460	6338460	Is China equal to Taiwan?
6338460	6339460	China on Taiwan
6339460	6340460	China in Taiwan
6340460	6341460	I don't know
6341460	6342460	China is in Taiwan
6342460	6343460	China is in Taiwan
6343460	6344460	China is Taiwan
6344460	6345460	I don't know
6346460	6348460	He used this form to express
6348460	6349460	Then another like Guatemala
6349460	6350460	It's the same
6350460	6351460	He also wrote like this
6353460	6354460	So this is actually
6355460	6356460	You know he
6356460	6358460	Taiwan's current state
6358460	6359460	Other countries
6359460	6361460	Even the diplomatic countries of the People's Republic of China
6361460	6363460	When dealing with Taiwan
6363460	6364460	He still has no way
6364460	6366460	Take the piece of China
6366460	6368460	So if you want to say
6368460	6370460	Taiwan is already
6370460	6371460	A sovereign independent country
6371460	6373460	That has nothing to do with the country
6373460	6374460	You will find that in fact
6374460	6376460	Not so much
6377460	6378460	OK
6378460	6379460	In the future
6379460	6381460	What should I do?
6382460	6383460	How to build
6383460	6384460	Actually I want to say
6384460	6385460	Sorry
6385460	6386460	We can end
6386460	6388460	In Taiwan's current history
6388460	6389460	Is the current international law positioning?
6389460	6390460	Because it's too long
6390460	6391460	Yes
6391460	6392460	OK
6392460	6393460	Then let's go back
6393460	6395460	You just wrote a line of red paper
6395460	6397460	Taiwan is not a country now
6397460	6398460	This page is good
6398460	6399460	OK
6401460	6402460	Sorry
6402460	6403460	I want to interrupt you
6403460	6405460	Because today is really too long
6405460	6407460	I think this is a very conclusive conclusion
6407460	6409460	Just take away
6409460	6411460	Based on international law
6411460	6413460	Taiwan is not a country now
6413460	6415460	If we have a chance
6415460	6417460	You can
6417460	6419460	We are looking for you to talk about this
6419460	6420460	The last part
6420460	6421460	That is
6421460	6422460	I'm sorry
6422460	6423460	It's okay
6423460	6424460	This thing is really
6424460	6425460	I originally wanted to
6425460	6426460	It's complicated
6426460	6428460	I originally wanted to cut it short
6428460	6429460	I found out
6429460	6430460	It seems to be impossible
6430460	6431460	OK
6432460	6433460	OK
6433460	6435460	Before we start asking questions
6435460	6436460	Still the same
6436460	6437460	Please turn on the microphone
6437460	6438460	Then we applaud again
6438460	6439460	Thank you, Shen Feng
6439460	6440460	Thank you
6442460	6443460	Thank you
6444460	6445460	OK
6445460	6446460	Do you have any questions?
6446460	6447460	Or comment?
6449460	6450460	Because I just interrupted
6450460	6451460	There may be one or two questions
6451460	6453460	That can be discussed now
6455460	6456460	Does anyone want to mention it?
6458460	6459460	That Sino-Japanese contract
6462460	6463460	Yes, but he
6468460	6469460	Because after he finished asking
6469460	6470460	It's been a long time
6470460	6472460	Maybe there is an answer
6472460	6473460	Let's just ask
6473460	6474460	Who else has any questions now?
6474460	6475460	Do you want to mention it?
6476460	6477460	Just based on
6477460	6478460	After listening to everything
6481460	6482460	Is there anyone who wants to ask a question?
6484460	6485460	OK
6485460	6486460	That means today's speech
6486460	6487460	I can ask
6487460	6488460	OK
6488460	6489460	You say
6489460	6490460	In fact, it is
6490460	6491460	In the count
6491460	6492460	Two
6492460	6493460	PowerPoint
6493460	6495460	I already have a little lost
6495460	6496460	You are here
6496460	6498460	For example, on this PowerPoint
6498460	6499460	It says
6499460	6501460	Is Taiwan already a country?
6501460	6503460	Your Taiwan here
6503460	6505460	This territory
6505460	6507460	The people on this territory
6507460	6509460	Republic of China government
6509460	6510460	Democratic Progressive Party government
6510460	6512460	What is Taiwan here?
6513460	6514460	This Taiwan
6515460	6516460	In fact, it is not
6516460	6517460	Democratic Progressive Party government
6517460	6518460	Those things
6518460	6519460	But just say
6519460	6520460	Now in Taiwan
6522460	6523460	Is this piece
6523460	6524460	Taiwan
6524460	6525460	With the island of Taiwan
6525460	6527460	With the surrounding area
6527460	6528460	With
6530460	6531460	Penghu Islands
6532460	6534460	On this piece
6534460	6535460	These lands
6535460	6536460	With the group
6536460	6537460	The group of people above
6537460	6538460	With the above
6539460	6540460	The current governance
6540460	6541460	That regime
6541460	6542460	With this
6542460	6543460	Wrap it up like this
6543460	6544460	This piece
6544460	6545460	This thing
6545460	6546460	Is it a country?
6547460	6548460	Is this territory
6548460	6549460	This people
6549460	6550460	This above
6551460	6552460	Governance
6552460	6553460	Government
6553460	6554460	Government
6554460	6555460	Government
6555460	6556460	This government
6557460	6558460	This regime
6558460	6559460	I'm not talking about the government
6559460	6560460	Is the governing regime above
6560460	6561460	Will he
6561460	6562460	Is he
6562460	6563460	Is it
6563460	6564460	Can this be regarded as a country?
6564460	6565460	Is it a country?
6565460	6567460	Is it a country on the international community?
6568460	6569460	Then you think
6569460	6570460	It's not a country
6570460	6572460	The reason is because of this territory
6573460	6574460	And the people above
6574460	6576460	Still undetermined
6578460	6579460	The territory is undetermined
6581460	6582460	The territory is undetermined
6582460	6583460	Because the territory belongs
6583460	6585460	Which country does it belong to?
6585460	6586460	Unknown
6586460	6587460	The territory is undetermined
6589460	6590460	Then above this
6590460	6591460	Republic of China regime
6592460	6593460	Above this
6593460	6594460	Republic of China regime itself
6594460	6595460	He is the Chinese regime
6597460	6598460	If he says today
6598460	6599460	If it is to be determined
6599460	6601460	If it is a country
6602460	6603460	He is also a
6603460	6604460	He is just China
6605460	6606460	He won't be
6606460	6607460	And there is no
6607460	6608460	China with air sovereignty
6609460	6610460	Because
6610460	6612460	Air sovereignty does not belong to any country
6612460	6614460	So even if he is a country
6614460	6615460	Republic of China regime
6615460	6616460	Even if it's a country
6617460	6618460	He is also in China
6618460	6619460	As a fugitive government
6620460	6621460	In Taiwan
6621460	6622460	Because
6622460	6624460	The country he represents is China
6624460	6625460	Not Taiwan
6626460	6627460	Because
6627460	6628460	Taiwan and Penghu's sovereignty
6628460	6629460	Does not belong to him
6629460	6630460	Of course, Taiwan and Penghu
6630460	6631460	Is being governed by him
6631460	6632460	That's right
6632460	6633460	but
6633460	6634460	He is not
6634460	6635460	His territorial scope
6635460	6637460	Does not include Taiwan and Penghu
6637460	6638460	So now this
6638460	6639460	A state
6639460	6640460	That is to say, Taiwan and Penghu
6640460	6641460	Now govern his
6641460	6642460	That regime
6642460	6643460	Does not have
6643460	6644460	He is not a
6644460	6645460	A country
6646460	6647460	As a government
6648460	6649460	To govern
6649460	6650460	He is not a
6650460	6651460	A territorial form
6651460	6652460	He is just a
6652460	6653460	Manager role
6653460	6655460	And his role as a manager
6655460	6656460	Is
6656460	6657460	In 1945
6657460	6659460	Under the auspices of the Allied Forces
6659460	6660460	What happened
6660460	6662460	So now the situation is
6664460	6666460	I'm talking about this part of Taiwan now
6667460	6668460	The main thing is
6668460	6670460	The part of the land and the people
6670460	6671460	The regime above
6671460	6672460	Because of his
6672460	6674460	Chinese regime
6674460	6675460	And China
6675460	6676460	Never got
6676460	6677460	Air sovereignty
6677460	6678460	This matter
6679460	6680460	Will become
6680460	6681460	He has no way
6681460	6683460	With Taiwan and Penghu
6683460	6684460	This part
6684460	6686460	Just become a country
6686460	6687460	Because
6687460	6690460	There is no territorial relationship between the two
6690460	6691460	He is a
6691460	6693460	Actually in
6693460	6695460	A state of governance
6696460	6697460	That
6697460	6699460	There is another one here
6699460	6701460	That participant has a question
6701460	6702460	But in
6702460	6703460	I'll ask him later
6703460	6704460	Because he is typing
6704460	6705460	But before asking
6705460	6706460	I have a little comment
6706460	6707460	To tell everyone
6707460	6708460	Just
6708460	6710460	I want to use
6710460	6712460	Shen Feng and Kiki's conversation
6712460	6713460	As an example
6713460	6715460	Project Taira's purpose
6715460	6717460	Is to make it possible
6717460	6718460	In different parts of the world
6718460	6720460	Because Kiki is actually in California now
6720460	6723460	Shen Feng is in Edinburgh
6723460	6724460	I personally think
6724460	6726460	You can have a good conversation
6726460	6727460	From different points of view
6727460	6729460	Create a good study of Taiwan
6729460	6730460	That
6730460	6731460	Because I happen to know both of them
6731460	6732460	So if you need
6732460	6734460	Leave the other party's contact information
6734460	6735460	You can ask me
6735460	6736460	Or
6737460	6738460	On Project Taira's website
6738460	6740460	There should be members
6740460	6741460	A personal page
6741460	6742460	Can find a way to contact
6742460	6743460	Then I really strongly
6743460	6745460	You should continue to communicate
6745460	6746460	Ok
6746460	6747460	This is my comment
6747460	6748460	Sorry
6748460	6749460	What is the direct relationship with the researcher
6749460	6750460	But
6750460	6752460	This Liu
6752460	6753460	He is Liu
6753460	6754460	Say
6754460	6755460	That old national law
6755460	6758460	How can Taiwan and Penghu be considered a country?
6758460	6761460	If Taiwan and Penghu finally broke up with the Republic of China regime
6761460	6763460	Do you have to break up with Jinma?
6763460	6764460	Then I think this is
6764460	6765460	The part I just cut off
6765460	6767460	right
6767460	6768460	Yes yes yes
6768460	6769460	Please continue
6769460	6770460	Pick a few
6770460	6771460	Just for this question
6771460	6773460	See how you answer
6773460	6774460	Ok
6774460	6776460	Then we will
6776460	6778460	Take a look
6780460	6781460	So you see
6781460	6783460	This thing still wants to talk about it
6786460	6787460	Ok good
6787460	6789460	That means everyone is very interested in this topic
6789460	6790460	Yes yes yes
6790460	6791460	Because the key is here
6791460	6792460	You know the current state
6792460	6793460	Of course you want to solve the problem
6793460	6794460	right
6794460	6796460	This is very normal
6796460	6797460	Anyway
6797460	6798460	Actually
6798460	6799460	How does Taiwan become a country?
6799460	6800460	In fact, I am talking now
6800460	6801460	You want to be a country
6801460	6803460	Your purpose is to become one
6803460	6805460	Recognized by the international community
6805460	6809460	A political entity that is willing to recognize the status of a country
6809460	6810460	So the point is
6810460	6812460	You have to follow the rules of international law
6812460	6816460	Don't give birth to some other weird things yourself
6816460	6817460	Ok
6817460	6818460	That is to say, like these
6818460	6820460	What I just talked about
6820460	6821460	Those
6821460	6822460	What I listed before
6822460	6823460	Those
6823460	6824460	All the way to 2016
6824460	6825460	What is the previous administration
6825460	6826460	These international law
6826460	6827460	No potential
6827460	6829460	So basically it doesn't make sense
6829460	6830460	What else
6830460	6831460	There are some
6831460	6832460	Prove self-reliance
6832460	6833460	Self-reliance
6833460	6834460	Self-reliance
6834460	6835460	These are all
6835460	6837460	All involve the constitution
6837460	6839460	I think it's from the constitution or the name
6839460	6841460	This is what I said at the beginning
6841460	6843460	There are some national characteristics
6843460	6845460	How do you change it
6845460	6847460	It won't change its essence
6847460	6848460	So today
6848460	6849460	No matter how you change your name
6849460	6850460	No matter how you make a constitution
6850460	6851460	It doesn't matter if it's abolished
6851460	6854460	Will not affect the Chinese regime of the Republic of China
6854460	6857460	Taiwan is not a country yet
6857460	6860460	You can't build a country through constitution
6860460	6864460	You have to build a country first and then constitution
6864460	6865460	The other point is
6865460	6866460	Taiwan's strength
6866460	6868460	Of course there is no way to make international rules by yourself
6868460	6870460	So it's according to the rules
6870460	6872460	According to international rules
6872460	6873460	In the international rules
6873460	6875460	There are rules in international law
6875460	6876460	One is the right of self-determination
6876460	6877460	So the right of self-determination
6877460	6878460	The constitution of the United Nations
6878460	6880460	Then the civil rights
6880460	6881460	Civil rights and political rights
6881460	6882460	International Convention
6882460	6883460	Economic, social, cultural rights
6883460	6884460	International Convention
6884460	6887460	All mentioned the right of self-determination
6887460	6888460	For Taiwan
6888460	6891460	The most important part is to decolonize
6891460	6892460	Because I mentioned earlier
6892460	6896460	Taiwan is the former colony of Japan
6896460	6897460	In fact, in principle
6897460	6898460	Taiwan as a former colony
6898460	6899460	It should be
6899460	6902460	Under the context of decolonization
6902460	6903460	The right of self-determination
6903460	6906460	And then build your own country
6906460	6907460	In the U.N. Congress
6907460	6908460	In fact, the U.N. Constitution itself
6908460	6909460	It has
6909460	6910460	There is a direct regulation
6910460	6912460	To this decolonization part
6912460	6913460	Decolonization is the U.N.
6913460	6916460	One of the main goals in the Constitution
6916460	6917460	In addition, the U.N. Convention
6917460	6918460	It also mentions
6918460	6919460	No. 1 and No. 4
6919460	6920460	Say
6920460	6921460	In the non-intellectual territory of the territory of the jurisdiction
6921460	6922460	Or other
6922460	6923460	Without reaching the territory of independence
6923460	6924460	Steps must be taken
6924460	6925460	Then everyone
6925460	6927460	Help these democracies
6927460	6929460	Be able to enjoy complete independence and freedom
6929460	6931460	So this is also the right of self-determination
6931460	6934460	The part of the U.N. Convention
6934460	6936460	In the other U.N. Convention
6936460	6937460	No. 1, 5, 4, 1
6937460	6938460	It mentions
6938460	6940460	When the right of self-determination is exercised
6940460	6941460	Non-intellectual territory
6941460	6942460	That's what it says
6942460	6943460	In order to achieve independence
6943460	6945460	These parts of the territory
6945460	6946460	Can be achieved in the following way
6946460	6947460	Complete self-determination
6947460	6949460	First, become a sovereign independent country
6949460	6951460	Second, become an independent country
6951460	6954460	Or join an independent country
6954460	6955460	The so-called sovereign independent country
6955460	6956460	Needless to say
6956460	6957460	Just become a country
6957460	6959460	In addition, become an independent country
6959460	6960460	This one
6960460	6961460	In fact, you are also a country
6961460	6963460	It's just that you may have some rights
6963460	6964460	Some rights on sovereignty
6964460	6965460	You just give it to other countries
6965460	6967460	Help you to execute
6967460	6969460	For example, like
6969460	6972460	The United States used to have some
6972460	6975460	According to the U.N. Convention
6975460	6977460	Regulations on deportation
6977460	6978460	Then give it to the U.S.
6978460	6980460	Some of the Pacific Islands
6980460	6981460	Some islands
6981460	6983460	After they became independent
6983460	6985460	They decided to be
6985460	6988460	To become a free party in the United States
6988460	6990460	That is to say, they put some rights
6990460	6992460	Just give it to the U.S.
6992460	6993460	Maybe it's the diplomatic part
6993460	6995460	Maybe it's the military part
6995460	6997460	They might even be
6997460	6998460	Use the U.S. dollar
6998460	7000460	Something like this
7000460	7003460	But these countries themselves still have
7003460	7006460	These still have national rights
7006460	7009460	The other one is to become an independent country
7009460	7010460	So for Taiwan
7010460	7012460	The choice after that is
7012460	7015460	In fact, it is in the context of colonization
7015460	7016460	Execute self-determination
7016460	7017460	When it comes to self-determination
7017460	7020460	There are these options
7020460	7021460	If Taiwan wants to become a country
7021460	7023460	That is, when it comes to self-determination
7023460	7028460	Choose to become a sovereign independent country
7028460	7030460	What about the current state?
7030460	7031460	In fact, it is important to say
7031460	7033460	First define Taipeng as
7033460	7036460	We are now under the arrangement of the Allied Forces
7036460	7037460	Members of the Allied Forces
7037460	7039460	For the Allied Forces
7039460	7042460	The occupation of the occupation
7042460	7043460	Occupation in governance
7043460	7044460	So they belong to
7044460	7047460	Not yet reached an independent territory
7047460	7048460	If you go through the UN
7048460	7051460	If the UN resolution 1514
7051460	7053460	The UN member states have the obligation
7053460	7056460	To assist Taiwan in gaining independence
7056460	7058460	But to be honest
7058460	7060460	Taiwan has never advocated this way
7060460	7062460	So we have always advocated
7062460	7063460	We are already a country
7063460	7068460	Then ask people to let us join the United Nations
7068460	7069460	In fact, through the original
7069460	7070460	I just talked about the United Nations
7070460	7072460	The right to self-determination mentioned in the Constitution of the United Nations
7072460	7075460	Then the United Nations
7075460	7078460	Then the other conventional signatories
7078460	7080460	They have no reason to deny
7080460	7082460	Taipeng's right to self-determination
7082460	7084460	Then you exercise
7084460	7086460	The right to self-determination is the same as the right to self-determination
7086460	7087460	In fact, the United Nations member states
7087460	7090460	There is no way to deny the effect of self-determination
7090460	7093460	So if Taiwan wants to become a country
7093460	7094460	In fact, it is very important
7094460	7096460	You use Taiwan as the host
7096460	7098460	The identity of the pre-colonial
7098460	7099460	Then combined with the international
7099460	7101460	Under the consensus of colonization
7101460	7102460	Confirm the self-determination of the colony
7102460	7103460	According to international convention
7104460	7106460	Then ask the United Nations member states to recognize
7106460	7108460	This one
7108460	7110460	I personally think this is the most
7110460	7113460	The most feasible route
7113460	7115460	This is definitely more than
7115460	7118460	Now you claim that Taiwan is already a sovereign independent country
7118460	7120460	But you are clearly now
7120460	7122460	It's a Chinese exile regime
7122460	7125460	Then you said you want to join the United Nations with this identity
7125460	7126460	Will be more effective than that
7126460	7129460	Because other countries will see that
7129460	7131460	You are the Chinese regime
7131460	7132460	I can't admit you
7132460	7134460	He is in the People's Republic of China regime
7134460	7138460	Choose one with the Republic of China regime
7138460	7140460	OK
7140460	7142460	So that is to say
7142460	7143460	In fact, this place just now
7143460	7144460	In fact, everyone has already talked about it
7144460	7147460	If you want to enter the United Nations
7147460	7148460	This is actually
7148460	7149460	I think there is something
7149460	7150460	Let me talk a little bit
7150460	7152460	Entering the United Nations is not the necessary procedure to build a country
7152460	7153460	Some people say
7153460	7155460	What does Taiwan have to enter the United Nations
7155460	7158460	To prove that you are a country
7159460	7162460	In fact, many countries
7162460	7164460	I didn't join the United Nations
7164460	7166460	For example, like Switzerland
7166460	7168460	I joined the United Nations in 2002
7168460	7171460	No other country has ever thought that you
7171460	7173460	Switzerland was not a country before 2002
7173460	7174460	Right
7174460	7176460	He is still a country
7176460	7177460	that
7177460	7178460	So
7178460	7180460	You said you want to join the United Nations to build a country
7180460	7181460	This is not right
7181460	7182460	This is not right
7182460	7185460	You have to build a country first
7186460	7187460	So
7189460	7191460	You don't have to join the United Nations after building a country
7191460	7194460	The basis of this sentence is the International Law
7194460	7195460	Because this is the question of building a country
7195460	7197460	But it doesn't matter if you don't build a country and you can't join the United Nations
7197460	7199460	It has nothing to do with the International Law
7199460	7202460	It is the rule of the United Nations
7202460	7204460	No, because the United Nations is
7204460	7205460	As I said earlier
7205460	7206460	This is the United Nations
7206460	7208460	Because the United Nations is an international organization
7208460	7209460	He himself
7209460	7212460	The requirement of becoming a member is to be a member
7212460	7214460	Yes, this is his internal rule
7214460	7216460	He is not part of the International Law
7216460	7218460	You have to say he is not part of the International Law
7218460	7219460	In fact, it should be said
7219460	7222460	He set such a rule in accordance with the International Law
7222460	7224460	He set such a rule in accordance with the International Law
7224460	7225460	That is to say, because the United Nations
7225460	7226460	In fact, it is based on the United Nations
7226460	7229460	An international organization established by the Constitution
7229460	7230460	OK
7230460	7231460	Yes
7231460	7233460	So we can only talk about it now
7233460	7234460	We can only talk about it now
7234460	7236460	That is to say
7236460	7238460	Members of the international organization
7238460	7240460	What kind of identity do you need to join
7240460	7241460	Is the international organization
7241460	7242460	His
7242460	7244460	For example, a document like this
7244460	7246460	How to write in such a document
7246460	7248460	How to decide
7248460	7251460	It is not stipulated that this person must be a country
7251460	7254460	To join the international organization
7254460	7256460	But this rule
7256460	7258460	Is the rule of this international organization
7258460	7261460	It was set out in accordance with the International Law
7261460	7262460	I see
7262460	7263460	Ok, that one
7263460	7264460	Because his question just now is
7264460	7267460	What should be done to uphold international law
7267460	7269460	He said it could be
7269460	7271460	But we are basically talking about
7271460	7272460	How to become
7272460	7273460	But basically
7273460	7274460	He turned out to mean the same
7274460	7275460	How do you become
7275460	7276460	How does it count
7276460	7278460	So you answered the first question
7278460	7279460	Let's talk about the second question directly
7279460	7280460	Let's talk about the second question directly
7280460	7281460	Let's talk about the second question directly
7281460	7282460	That is
7282460	7285460	Taipeng broke up with the Republic of China
7285460	7288460	Do you have to break up with Jinma?
7288460	7290460	Oh yes
7290460	7292460	But Jinma
7292460	7293460	But Jinma, he can
7293460	7296460	They can also exercise self-determination
7296460	7300460	What is self-determination
7300460	7301460	That is
7301460	7302460	It should be said like this
7302460	7305460	That is, Taipeng, you can
7305460	7307460	Can be self-determined
7307460	7309460	Become a sovereign independent country
7309460	7310460	Right
7310460	7312460	What about Jinma
7312460	7314460	Of course it can
7314460	7316460	Because I just mentioned it here
7316460	7320460	What about Jinma
7320460	7322460	Basically
7322460	7323460	Taipeng
7323460	7324460	You follow the international law
7324460	7326460	Under the context of decolonization
7326460	7328460	Exercise self-determination
7328460	7330460	Then establish a sovereign independent country
7330460	7332460	This is the way Taipeng wants to go
7332460	7334460	If you want to be a country
7334460	7335460	This road is
7335460	7336460	I think
7336460	7340460	Personally, I think it is the best way
7340460	7341460	But part of Jinma
7341460	7344460	Because his sovereignty belongs to China
7344460	7346460	So what they need to do is
7346460	7347460	Independent
7347460	7350460	To separate from China and come out independently
7350460	7352460	Then separate from China and come out independently
7352460	7354460	Then you have to have a
7354460	7356460	Chinese regime
7356460	7358460	To hold such an independent meeting
7358460	7360460	So Jinma
7360460	7361460	He said
7361460	7362460	Want to
7362460	7365460	If you want to be with Taiwan and Penghu
7365460	7367460	That is, Jinma's resident
7367460	7369460	He followed the regime of the Republic of China
7369460	7372460	Hold a self-determination meeting there
7372460	7375460	Then decide whether to be independent from the Republic of China
7375460	7376460	Then after independence
7376460	7377460	Then see if he wants to
7377460	7379460	Become a country here
7379460	7380460	Or to join
7380460	7382460	The new country established by Taipeng
7382460	7385460	This is their choice
7385460	7389460	But what I have to say is
7389460	7390460	Jinma people
7390460	7393460	Do they want to be with Taiwan and Penghu
7393460	7396460	This is a question mark
7396460	7398460	This is a big question mark
7398460	7400460	I think sometimes it is like this
7400460	7402460	We think they seem to want to be with us
7402460	7404460	We seem to want us to abandon them
7404460	7405460	Abandon them or something
7405460	7408460	But in fact, Jinma people may not think so
7408460	7411460	They may not think at all
7411460	7413460	I am Taiwanese
7413460	7414460	They may
7414460	7416460	They should basically admit that they are the people of the Republic of China
7416460	7417460	No problem
7417460	7419460	The citizens of the Republic of China are OK
7419460	7421460	But do they think they are Taiwanese?
7421460	7423460	Do they want to be with Taiwan?
7423460	7425460	This is sometimes a question mark
7425460	7427460	Because you see some news
7427460	7430460	Jinma people seem
7430460	7432460	They seem to think they are Chinese
7432460	7434460	The ratio is higher
7434460	7436460	Of course we have opened the way for everyone
7436460	7438460	There is a way to go in international law
7438460	7440460	They hold an independent meeting
7440460	7442460	See if they want to be independent from China
7442460	7444460	Then move to another country
7444460	7445460	They can do
7445460	7447460	The other point is that if
7447460	7449460	Jinma people
7449460	7451460	They can't get through the independent meeting
7451460	7453460	Let Jinma become
7453460	7454460	Taipeng
7454460	7456460	Become the same country as Taipeng
7456460	7457460	His people
7457460	7459460	He can also be planned
7459460	7462460	Become the citizens of this new country
7462460	7464460	In fact, many Jinma
7464460	7465460	Jinma people
7465460	7467460	They are actually living on the island of Taiwan now
7467460	7469460	May be there to get married and have children
7469460	7471460	Then buy a house or something
7471460	7472460	So for them
7472460	7474460	Maybe most of the time they are in Taiwan
7474460	7476460	Maybe they think
7476460	7478460	Maybe it will become the citizens of Taipeng
7478460	7480460	No problem
7480460	7482460	If they don't want to
7482460	7484460	They can also be the people of the Republic of China
7484460	7486460	Is a foreigner
7486460	7488460	Continue to stay
7488460	7490460	In fact, the subsequent disposal
7490460	7492460	There are legal means
7492460	7494460	It can be solved
7494460	7495460	Just
7495460	7497460	It's just that in international law
7497460	7498460	If we want to
7498460	7500460	If you want to deal with this issue
7500460	7501460	You have to separate
7501460	7503460	Because there is no way to solve the problem together
7503460	7505460	If you put it together
7505460	7507460	You just mix it up
7507460	7508460	The unsettled
7508460	7510460	With those who belong to the territory of China
7510460	7512460	There is no way to do it together
7512460	7514460	Because when it comes to processing
7514460	7516460	The rules are different
7516460	7518460	So you have to deal with it
7518460	7519460	Must be divided
7519460	7521460	But will it be together in the end?
7521460	7523460	That depends on
7523460	7524460	I would think
7524460	7526460	It depends on the wishes of the Kinmen people
7526460	7529460	I don't know if they want to be with Taiwan
7529460	7530460	OK
7530460	7532460	So for the second question
7532460	7534460	Basically the answer is the first
7534460	7535460	Yes
7535460	7537460	Have to break up with Kinmen
7537460	7538460	The second is
7538460	7539460	But Kinmen can be based on
7539460	7541460	Is the context of decolonization
7541460	7543460	Make their own self-awareness
7543460	7545460	Kinmen is not the context of decolonization
7545460	7547460	Because Kinmen has not been colonized
7547460	7548460	OK
7548460	7549460	Kinmen they
7549460	7550460	Because they are independent
7550460	7552460	They are directly separated and independent
7552460	7554460	Taiwan and Penghu
7554460	7556460	Taiwan and Penghu are decolonized
7556460	7558460	Kinmen is separated and independent
7558460	7560460	That is to say, separated and independent from China
7560460	7562460	Just like Scotland
7562460	7564460	Separated from the United Kingdom
7564460	7566460	Quebec is separated from Canada
7566460	7567460	OK
7567460	7569460	Kinmen independence is such a form
7569460	7571460	Different from Taiwan
7571460	7572460	That
7572460	7575460	Liu said thank you for the detailed explanation of the speaker
7575460	7576460	Then I think
7576460	7577460	Come here today
7577460	7578460	Also cover you
7578460	7579460	Last
7579460	7580460	Sorry
7580460	7581460	The part that was cut off by me
7581460	7582460	Most of the cut
7582460	7584460	I just finished talking
7584460	7585460	OK
7585460	7586460	Ok
7586460	7588460	We are here again
7588460	7589460	Applause
7589460	7591460	Thank you for the speech brought to us by Saint
7591460	7593460	It's already two o'clock in the middle of the night over there
7593460	7595460	Thank you very much
7595460	7596460	Thank you
7596460	7597460	That
7597460	7598460	Everyone is me
7598460	7599460	I want to stop recording first
7599460	7601460	But you are welcome to continue discussing
7601460	7602460	OK
