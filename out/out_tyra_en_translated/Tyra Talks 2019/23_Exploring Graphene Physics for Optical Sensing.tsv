0	8000	Hello everyone, welcome to the 7th of March, this week's Tara Talk.
8000	15000	We are very honored to invite Dr. Jason Hong to tell us about his research.
15000	20000	The topic he is going to talk about today is Exploring Graphic Physics for Optical Sensing.
20000	24000	He said that this is his work when he was studying for his doctorate degree at UC Berkeley.
25000	28000	Let me introduce Dr. Jason Hong.
28000	30000	He graduated from the Department of Physics in Taiwan.
30000	36000	He later studied for his doctorate degree at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
36000	39000	After his doctorate degree, he is now working as a doctor in Michigan.
39000	43000	His field of expertise is super-fast light in physical and physical applications.
43000	58000	His main field of expertise is optical sensing, two-dimensional semiconductor exciton and cavity exciton polariton.
58000	63000	He is going to talk about his work in his doctorate degree, Graphic Optical Sensing.
63000	65000	We are going to give him a round of applause.
65000	69000	But we need to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.
69000	72000	Let's welcome Dr. Jason Hong to give us a speech.
78000	79000	Thank you, everyone.
79000	89000	I am going to focus on optical sensing in graphic physics.
89000	93000	I won't talk too much about super-fast light.
93000	100000	If you want to know more about super-fast light, you can go to my previous talk at TerraTalk.
100000	103000	Hello, everyone. I am Jason Hong.
103000	106000	This is today's outline.
106000	111000	First of all, I am going to talk about motivation.
111000	118000	I am going to tell you why we need to use graphene or, more broadly, two-dimensional materials to make optical sensors.
118000	120000	What are the advantages of using them?
121000	124000	What are the side effects of using them?
124000	132000	I am going to give you two examples of what I am doing.
132000	139000	One is to use graphene to observe electrochemistry.
139000	153000	Electrochemistry is the chemical reaction that occurs between a solid state and a liquid state.
153000	162000	We can use graphene as an optical sensor to observe these electrochemistry reactions.
163000	170000	This is because we developed a method called Diffrational Vibrational Spectroscopy.
170000	180000	We can see the signals of the small molecules on the graphene.
181000	189000	Another example is that we want to observe neurotransmitters on graphene.
189000	192000	Neurotransmitters produce electrical signals.
192000	198000	These electrical signals are the methods of transmitting information in our brain.
198000	208000	We put neurotransmitters on graphene and use graphene to observe these neurotransmitters.
208000	214000	This is because we developed a method called Waveguide-Based Imaging.
214000	217000	We will introduce this method in detail later.
217000	221000	Let's start with Motivation.
221000	230000	Before talking about Motivation, let's learn about what is a two-dimensional material.
231000	236000	Can you see the figure on the left?
236000	240000	Can you see my mouse?
240000	246000	Yes, I can see it.
246000	253000	This is graphite.
253000	258000	The structure of graphite is a layer of carbon atoms.
258000	266000	When a layer of graphite is separated, it is called graphene.
266000	274000	When a layer of graphite is rolled up, it is called carbon nanotube.
274000	279000	When a layer of graphite is rolled up, it is called fullerene.
280000	298000	Historically, we first discovered the structure of carbon nanotube.
298000	301000	We have never discovered the structure of graphene.
301000	306000	Of course, we know that graphene exists in the structure of graphite.
306000	311000	But we have never seen the existence of graphene alone.
311000	314000	What is the reason?
314000	327000	In order to calculate the properties of graphene, nanotube, and fullerene,
327000	334000	the theorists already know the properties of graphene.
334000	340000	The properties of electricity and light are already known.
341000	353000	Before the discovery of graphene, there was a theory.
353000	361000	When the two materials of graphene exist separately, they are thermodynamically unstable.
362000	374000	The thermodynamic effect causes ripples on the surface of the two materials.
374000	380000	In the end, the two materials will stick together and become a bunch of wrinkles.
380000	387000	Therefore, the previous theorists thought that the two materials alone could not exist.
387000	397000	In 2004, the two Nobel Prize winners, Andrew Gamm and Novoselov,
397000	402000	discovered that they could use a very simple method.
402000	409000	They put graphene on a tape and peeled it off layer by layer.
409000	413000	Finally, they put it on the silicon wafer.
413000	419000	They observed that a single layer of graphene could exist.
419000	426000	The main reason is that it is not an isolated 2D material.
426000	429000	It also has some ripples.
429000	435000	But because there is a substrate underneath,
435000	443000	you can put the two materials on the substrate to make them exist in the world.
443000	449000	At that time, many people were trying similar things.
449000	452000	There are many strange methods.
452000	461000	In the end, they found that the most effective way was to use tape.
462000	466000	In fact, there are many interesting stories.
466000	468000	We can share them later.
472000	475000	After the discovery of graphene,
475000	482000	we know that the two-dimensional material can exist alone on the substrate.
482000	487000	Later, a series of two-dimensional materials were developed.
487000	493000	Today, we focus on two-dimensional materials related to light.
493000	495000	In fact, there are many different materials,
495000	502000	such as two-dimensional superconductors or two-dimensional magnetic materials.
502000	508000	For light, the most important thing is the bandgap of this material.
508000	518000	You can see that there is no bandgap between graphene and molybdenum and molybdenum disulfide.
518000	522000	Graphene is a semi-metal,
522000	526000	and there is basically no bandgap.
526000	533000	Molybdenum and molybdenum disulfide are two-dimensional superconductors,
533000	535000	and there is a bandgap.
535000	538000	Graphene is an insulator,
538000	540000	and there is a very large bandgap.
540000	544000	We have all kinds of two-dimensional materials,
544000	550000	which can cover the entire spectrum of light.
550000	555000	In fact, in each spectrum,
555000	560000	in each region from microwave to visible,
560000	563000	people use two-dimensional materials to do something.
563000	568000	The interesting thing is that two-dimensional materials give you a lot of new degrees of freedom.
568000	570000	For example, you can change the number of layers,
570000	574000	you can change the doping of electrons in the two-dimensional material,
574000	579000	and usually the two-dimensional material is a hexagonal structure,
579000	583000	so it has two different values.
583000	588000	There are two minima on the bandstructure.
589000	594000	And these two-dimensional materials are very easy to integrate.
594000	597000	What we can do now is that
597000	607000	we can use some methods to pick up these two-dimensional materials,
607000	613000	and then we can stack them layer by layer to the place we want.
613000	618000	The important thing is that
618000	623000	you have to match the lattice.
623000	627000	For example, in the past, the structure was used to grow.
627000	630000	The way to grow is to make sure that
630000	636000	the lattice of the base and the thing you want to grow is the same.
636000	642000	Otherwise, you will have a lot of strain.
642000	647000	It will lead to a lot of constraints for these devices.
647000	649000	But the two-dimensional material does not have this problem.
649000	652000	You can put it wherever you want.
652000	656000	So we can do a lot of things that we couldn't do before.
656000	664000	These two-dimensional materials have a very strong effect on light.
664000	668000	We will see these effects later.
669000	676000	When you have this two-dimensional material toolbox,
676000	679000	and there are so many new degrees of freedom,
679000	681000	we can do a lot of different things.
681000	687000	For example, someone is studying how to use two-dimensional materials to make photodetectors and modulators.
687000	690000	There are LEDs and lasers for light.
690000	698000	There are also people doing nonlinear optics or single photon emission.
698000	703000	In short, I think this field is quite developed.
703000	709000	And there are a lot of new ideas that need to be tried.
709000	714000	And none of them have been tried.
714000	718000	So we don't know what will happen.
721000	727000	Why do I choose graphene as a light sensor?
727000	733000	What are the advantages of graphene sensors?
733000	735000	From the perspective of two-dimensional materials,
735000	738000	the first is that it has very good sensitivity.
738000	744000	The second advantage is that because it is a two-dimensional material,
744000	748000	we can easily change its electron doping.
749000	754000	From the perspective of optics,
754000	756000	when you want to make a sensor,
756000	759000	you need to pay attention to the light.
759000	763000	If you use light to detect or compare to other methods,
763000	767000	such as electromagnetic or other hardware,
767000	771000	the advantage of light is that it is non-invasive.
771000	776000	And you can penetrate the lower part.
776000	779000	So when the light hits your sample,
779000	782000	you will not cause damage to the sample.
782000	786000	And the more interesting thing is that light can do spectroscopy.
786000	789000	So you can get a lot of extra information.
789000	791000	And it can do imaging.
791000	793000	Sometimes it's what you really want.
793000	799000	For example, we want to do the structure of neural cells.
799000	801000	How do we imagine it?
801000	803000	This is a very important thing.
804000	806000	Sorry, can I interrupt you?
806000	808000	No problem.
808000	809000	OK, I want to ask.
809000	812000	Because we are also doing 2D material.
812000	816000	You said that it is easy to do doping on 2D.
816000	818000	But I want to know your strategy.
818000	820000	Because we encountered a big problem.
820000	822000	In fact, we found that it was not so simple.
822000	824000	Or doping is actually unstable.
827000	831000	The doping I'm talking about here is mainly electrical doping.
831000	833000	We add an electrode.
833000	841000	Then inject the electron directly with the method of electrolysis.
842000	844000	It's actually gate control.
844000	846000	Yes, it's gate control.
846000	848000	OK, so I misunderstood.
848000	849000	OK, thank you.
851000	854000	I think you want to talk about chemical doping.
854000	855000	Similar.
855000	858000	It should be called twin Fermi level.
859000	863000	Later, when I talk about examples.
863000	866000	You will see how we tune the Fermi level.
869000	871000	I think this degree of freedom is very important.
871000	873000	And it's a new degree of freedom.
873000	876000	So I think it's quite useful.
882000	886000	Graphene is the first two-dimensional material to be discovered.
886000	888000	It is a one-layer atomic layer.
892000	897000	Everyone says it has very good electrical, optical, chemical and mechanical properties.
897000	900000	Electrical has very high mobility.
901000	905000	Optical has a very strong light response.
907000	912000	Interestingly, a single layer of graphene can absorb 2% of light.
912000	914000	This is actually quite interesting.
914000	918000	You can imagine that a single layer of atomic layer can absorb 2% of light.
922000	926000	Another interesting thing is that you can directly see graphene with the naked eye.
926000	931000	This is also something that people may not have thought of before 2004.
933000	935000	Chemical properties.
935000	942000	Graphene is actually a structure of many hexagonal carbons.
942000	944000	So it has a very strong pi-pi reaction.
944000	950000	Many people use this pi-pi reaction to functionalize graphene.
950000	952000	Then you can do different things.
954000	957000	Mechanically, graphene has a very strong elasticity.
957000	959000	So it is very flexible.
961000	967000	I think the most important thing is that graphene is a single atomic layer.
967000	971000	So all the material is on its surface.
972000	980000	This material is very sensitive to its environment.
980000	985000	If there is a little movement outside, graphene will react.
987000	992000	I think this is the most important thing for the optical sensor.
993000	995000	I have a question.
999000	1007000	Is there a selection rule for the interaction between graphene and light?
1011000	1018000	What is the interaction between graphene and light?
1019000	1021000	Is its mechanism a dipole?
1024000	1026000	Yes, it is a dipole.
1031000	1035000	Graphene is a Dirac cone structure.
1036000	1043000	You can imagine that it is a band-to-band interaction.
1043000	1049000	From the bottom valence band to the top conduction band.
1049000	1053000	Because the bottom is filled with electrons and the top is empty.
1053000	1055000	So this transition is allowed.
1057000	1061000	That transition is the 2% assumption I mentioned.
1064000	1068000	There are also intra-band transitions.
1068000	1071000	There is also acetone in higher energy.
1074000	1077000	This is the band structure of graphene.
1081000	1083000	Brinois zone is hexagonal.
1083000	1087000	There are Dirac cones at the edge of the Brinois zone.
1087000	1092000	Its energy and momentum dispersion are linear.
1092000	1098000	General semiconductors are parabolic.
1099000	1104000	If you calculate like this, the density of state is also linear.
1106000	1112000	You can see that the density of state is equal to the Fermi energy.
1112000	1118000	When the Fermi energy is zero, the density of state is very small.
1118000	1120000	What does it mean?
1121000	1127000	When there is some external influence,
1127000	1132000	which causes some doping in the graphene,
1132000	1136000	the Fermi energy will move very fast.
1136000	1142000	If it moves fast, it means that it is easy to change the optical transition.
1142000	1154000	This causes that the external influence of graphene is very large.
1157000	1161000	One of the effects is that the electrical energy is also very large.
1161000	1166000	What I show here is a field effect device.
1166000	1170000	Basically, graphene is on silicon dioxide.
1170000	1172000	Silicon dioxide is an insulator.
1172000	1176000	Silicon is a conductor.
1176000	1182000	Graphene and silicon form an electrolyte.
1182000	1187000	When you add a voltage, the graphene will be electrically doped.
1187000	1190000	The electrons will go to the graphene.
1190000	1194000	Or you can extract the electrons in the graphene.
1195000	1203000	The graph on the right shows that when you change the gate voltage,
1203000	1208000	that is, when you change the number of electrons in the graphene,
1208000	1213000	its resistance will increase and decrease.
1213000	1217000	This is a very important phenomenon of graphene.
1217000	1223000	The external voltage can change the resistance of graphene.
1223000	1226000	The change is very drastic.
1226000	1236000	Many people use this principle to make graphene's electrical sensor.
1237000	1247000	Another advantage of graphene is that it is flexible.
1247000	1258000	This means that it can be compatible with biological materials.
1258000	1262000	It can make all kinds of flexible devices.
1263000	1270000	It can also do chemical binding.
1270000	1275000	For example, you can add DNA or protein to it.
1275000	1281000	In this way, you will have some chemical selectivity.
1281000	1287000	Next, I will talk about two examples I made.
1287000	1290000	Let's start with the first example.
1290000	1297000	The first example is to use graphene to look at the chemistry near the electrode.
1297000	1301000	Do you have any other questions before I talk about it?
1307000	1308000	Okay, no.
1308000	1311000	Then I will continue.
1312000	1316000	There is a very important problem.
1316000	1324000	In fact, we often use graphene as an electrode in our daily life.
1324000	1333000	For example, your home's carbonate battery is also used as an electrode.
1333000	1337000	You know that the battery has to produce chemical reactions.
1337000	1343000	These chemical reactions are actually produced on these deliberate cross-sections.
1343000	1352000	How to understand these chemical processes is a very important thing.
1352000	1355000	We developed a method.
1355000	1367000	We use IR light to detect the molecules near the graphene.
1367000	1381000	This is the main mechanism of IR infrared vibrational spectroscopy.
1381000	1385000	These molecules have different vibration modes.
1385000	1397000	These vibration modes have different frequency.
1397000	1402000	When you put a IR light on these molecules,
1402000	1405000	it will excite these vibrations.
1405000	1408000	Then the IR light will be absorbed.
1408000	1414000	Because the IR light will only be absorbed at that frequency,
1414000	1421000	you can see what kind of vibration structure these molecules have.
1421000	1424000	Of course, different molecules also have different vibration structures.
1424000	1428000	So you can tell which molecule you are hitting now.
1428000	1437000	In fact, you can know the arrangement and appearance of these molecules in more detail.
1437000	1451000	For example, you can see that EXO's spectrum is light energy.
1451000	1456000	This is about three microns of light.
1456000	1462000	These peaks represent several different vibration modes.
1463000	1466000	There is a problem.
1466000	1478000	Because the chemical reactions on the surface are very rare.
1478000	1481000	Very few molecules are involved in the reaction.
1481000	1483000	Because usually only one or two layers are enough.
1483000	1488000	How to see this one or two-layer molecule structure is a big problem.
1488000	1496000	In general, the absorption of one-layer molecules is about 10 to the power of 3 to 10 to the power of 4.
1496000	1503000	You have to spend a lot of time to integrate the signal to see it.
1503000	1508000	We developed a method called diffractional spectroscopy.
1508000	1513000	In general, people do IR spectroscopy.
1513000	1520000	When you hit the light of the IR, you can see its reflection.
1520000	1530000	At this time, the electric field can be imagined as the electric field from the substrate.
1530000	1536000	The electric field from the substrate and the electric field from the molecule are quite close.
1536000	1550000	The difference in intensity is the electric field square.
1550000	1563000	When you expand this, you will find that it is two times one from the molecule divided by one from the substrate.
1563000	1569000	This is about 0.2%, which is about 10 to the power of 4.
1569000	1582000	The method we use is to make graphene into a periodic grating shape.
1582000	1593000	Only on the surface of the graphene will there be these molecules.
1593000	1600000	You can imagine that these things are grating, so they will produce one-layer reflection or two-layer reflection.
1600000	1607000	Of course, we only look at one-layer reflection.
1607000	1615000	Because the interface between the substrate and the solution is actually non-periodic,
1615000	1620000	it does not participate in the diffraction.
1620000	1625000	Only graphene and these molecules can participate in the diffraction.
1625000	1631000	At this time, the electric field from the substrate and the electric field from the molecule are close.
1631000	1650000	As mentioned earlier, the absorption of graphene is about 2%, which means that its electric field is about 1%.
1650000	1654000	The electric field from the substrate is about 10 to the power of 3.
1654000	1663000	When you do the calculation like this, you will find that it is the electric field from the molecule and the electric field from the graphene.
1663000	1668000	This thing is obviously much bigger, and now it becomes 20%.
1668000	1673000	In theory, it can suddenly increase the sensitivity by 100 times.
1674000	1679000	This thing is likely to allow you to detect single-layer molecules.
1687000	1689000	Can I ask a question?
1689000	1694000	Does the original reflection affect the mechanism just now?
1694000	1699000	Will it affect the signal that you finally gradient?
1700000	1708000	The original reflection will be at the angle of the reflection.
1708000	1714000	But at this time, we can choose to only look at the angle of the diffraction.
1714000	1716000	Oh, I see.
1716000	1720000	Then we look at this angle and there will be a very strong signal.
1720000	1722000	Thank you.
1723000	1729000	Then we make the graphene into the shape of the grating.
1729000	1741000	On the other side of the graphene, there is a platinum electrode with a voltage.
1741000	1744000	This is basically a battery structure.
1745000	1754000	When the light hits it, of course you will have a reflected signal.
1754000	1760000	But there will also be a diffraction signal from the periodic structure of the graphene.
1760000	1769000	We can basically use the method of light to select that we only need to look at the diffraction.
1770000	1779000	Basically, what we see is the intensity of the diffraction.
1779000	1785000	You don't have to look at the red line first, just look at the black line.
1785000	1791000	The dots are experimental.
1792000	1800000	You can see that the charge control point is basically the graphene at Fermi energy equals zero.
1800000	1803000	There will be some diffraction.
1803000	1812000	When you increase the electron in the graphene, the intensity of the diffraction will decrease.
1812000	1816000	When you add more, it will increase again.
1816000	1828000	The first thing we need to understand is how the diffraction occurs in the graphene.
1828000	1836000	We can understand that there are two kinds of transitions in the graphene.
1836000	1838000	One is the interband transition.
1838000	1846000	The graphene balance band is full of electrons.
1846000	1850000	The graphene conduction band has no electrons.
1850000	1858000	When the light comes in, it can go from an electron state to a state without electrons.
1858000	1861000	This is the transition allowed.
1861000	1865000	The light will be 2% absorption.
1866000	1872000	When you change your Fermi energy,
1872000	1881000	For example, the low-energy light has some electrons in its conduction band.
1881000	1883000	These electrons can't go up.
1883000	1887000	This transition is called forbidden.
1887000	1889000	It can't produce this transition.
1889000	1891000	These lights will be transmitted.
1892000	1903000	Basically, we can see that when the light is 2EF,
1903000	1906000	there will be an onset.
1906000	1909000	It can be absorbed above 2EF.
1909000	1912000	It can't be absorbed below 2EF.
1912000	1919000	When you change the Fermi energy,
1919000	1923000	the onset will be changed.
1923000	1938000	Another kind of absorption is called free carrier response.
1938000	1943000	It is called the interband transition.
1943000	1952000	The graphene electrons jump from the balance band to the balance band.
1952000	1955000	This is not possible in light theory.
1955000	1960000	Light has a very small momentum.
1960000	1972000	This is the scattering caused by the phonon or defect in the graphene.
1972000	1977000	When the free carrier increases,
1977000	1979000	when the doping increases,
1979000	1981000	it also increases.
1981000	1985000	Doping is a Drude behavior.
1985000	1990000	It is a Lorentzian type of behavior.
1990000	1995000	When you add these two things together,
1995000	2001000	you will find that we can calculate the optical conductivity of graphene.
2001000	2008000	The optical conductivity is basically equal to the diffraction intensity.
2009000	2014000	You can see the graph on the right.
2014000	2019000	For example, let's look at 0.13EV.
2019000	2023000	When the Fermi energy is 130mEV,
2023000	2031000	on the right is the interband transition.
2031000	2034000	There are some absorption here.
2034000	2037000	There is an onset here.
2037000	2040000	This is 2EF.
2040000	2042000	The area of 3000 is 2EF.
2042000	2044000	The upper part is the interband transition.
2044000	2046000	The lower part is blocked.
2046000	2051000	The bulging part is the interband transition.
2051000	2055000	When the EF increases,
2055000	2057000	the interband transition increases.
2057000	2061000	The onset of the interband transition is shifted to the right.
2062000	2067000	Our experiment is done at about 3000EV,
2067000	2072000	which is about 3.3uEV.
2072000	2079000	You can see that when the Fermi energy is very small,
2079000	2082000	it is mainly an interband transition.
2082000	2089000	This causes a large diffraction intensity at the CMP.
2090000	2093000	However, when the doping occurs,
2093000	2097000	the interband transition is gradually blocked.
2097000	2101000	The intensity starts to drop,
2101000	2105000	which is about 0.8 to 0.4.
2105000	2110000	Finally, when you continue to increase the doping,
2110000	2116000	the interband transition will start to participate in the absorption.
2116000	2121000	You will see a strong diffraction intensity.
2121000	2125000	We can understand the diffraction of graphene in this way.
2139000	2144000	Next, we will do a demonstration.
2144000	2149000	We put a molecule called Ctab.
2149000	2152000	It is a long-chain structure.
2152000	2158000	These long-chain structures like to run on the electrode of graphene.
2158000	2164000	We use IR spectroscopy to look at these Ctab molecules.
2164000	2170000	They are on the channel of diffraction.
2171000	2176000	We see that the spectrum is similar to this.
2176000	2183000	Basically, the diffraction is the interference of the electric field of graphene
2183000	2188000	and the electric field of the molecule.
2188000	2193000	The diffraction intensity you see is also like this.
2193000	2195000	It has a background.
2195000	2200000	This background is from graphene, which is about 0.85.
2200000	2204000	In addition, these peaks are from these molecules.
2204000	2208000	There are many CH2 and CH3 in this long-chain molecule.
2208000	2213000	We can compare these with the database.
2213000	2217000	We can know which vibration mode each peak represents.
2217000	2222000	For example, this peak may be symmetric CH2.
2222000	2227000	This peak may be anti-symmetric CH2.
2227000	2230000	This peak may be CH3 vibration.
2230000	2239000	This spectrum is taken in 0.1 seconds.
2239000	2249000	We can compare the contrast with the detection you do directly with reflection.
2249000	2255000	The contrast has increased by 50 times, which is about 100 times as we expected.
2255000	2266000	The density of this molecule is actually only 0.16 monolayer.
2266000	2270000	It is actually a very small density in graphene.
2270000	2272000	We can already see it.
2272000	2276000	This means that this method can enhance our sensitivity.
2277000	2285000	We can see 0.16 monolayer changes in 0.1 seconds.
2285000	2288000	Excuse me, can I ask?
2288000	2298000	Is the size of this molecule and the size of this graphene similar to what you show on the picture?
2298000	2300000	Or is it not different at all?
2301000	2305000	The size of the molecule?
2305000	2307000	What do you mean?
2307000	2309000	Do you mean the picture on the left?
2309000	2311000	Yes.
2311000	2313000	This picture is a memory map.
2313000	2320000	So the CTAP is much smaller than the graphene.
2320000	2325000	I'm just a little curious.
2325000	2331000	So what is the width of the graphene?
2331000	2336000	Because I didn't see it when you showed the picture.
2336000	2339000	I forgot.
2339000	2342000	It should be around 1 to 2 microns.
2342000	2346000	Because you can imagine that our light goes in three microns.
2346000	2352000	So if you want to separate the first order and the first order, it's probably in that order.
2355000	2358000	I see. Thank you.
2364000	2374000	Next, we will demonstrate that we can directly observe the chemical reaction on the graphene.
2374000	2376000	And it's timely.
2376000	2382000	Because we can see 0.16 monolayers in 0.1 seconds.
2382000	2385000	So you can actually see these reactions very quickly.
2385000	2396000	Basically, CTAP and graphene will produce a reaction when your gating is large enough.
2396000	2399000	They will produce a reaction like this.
2399000	2404000	CTAP will throw an electron and produce these reactions.
2404000	2409000	You can see the picture we just showed before the reaction.
2409000	2415000	After the reaction, the spectrum has changed.
2415000	2418000	And the first thing is that the background has changed.
2418000	2422000	The background means that the graphene was originally 0.85.
2422000	2424000	The intensity is about 0.85.
2424000	2426000	Now it's more than 2.
2426000	2429000	This means that the graphene has been doped.
2429000	2433000	And the Fermi energy of the graphene has changed.
2433000	2436000	So the intensity of the background has changed.
2436000	2446000	Another thing you can see is that you can see the anti-symmetric CH2 and CH3.
2446000	2450000	The anti-symmetric CH2 is still there.
2450000	2455000	But the CH3 peak is significantly redshifted.
2455000	2461000	This means that when these molecules are on the graphene,
2461000	2466000	Because the packing is tight, the vibration of CH3 is redshifted.
2466000	2471000	This means that the chemical reaction has occurred.
2471000	2476000	So we can see these small spectrum changes.
2476000	2480000	This is a demonstration.
2480000	2486000	We can observe these chemical reactions near the graphene in an in-situ way.
2486000	2489000	We can use the diffraction method.
2489000	2499000	In this experiment, we developed the diffraction spectroscopy method.
2499000	2506000	This method can improve the detection sensitivity and surface specificity.
2506000	2519000	We think that this method can be applied to electrolyte and electrode.
2519000	2525000	Because it is very easy to make the shape of the graphene into a grating.
2525000	2528000	So I think this is a very general method.
2528000	2542000	I think it can be used as a reference for those who do chemical engineering.
2542000	2548000	Next, I will talk about how to use graphene for biosensing.
2548000	2551000	The main thing we need to measure is bioelectricity.
2551000	2555000	It is the electrical signal of nerve cells or heart cells.
2555000	2563000	The electrical signal of nerve cells is a very hot topic.
2563000	2568000	Although it has been a long time, people do not know much about it.
2568000	2574000	We know how a single nerve cell transmits electrical signals.
2574000	2583000	But we do not know what the electrical signals mean on a network of nerve cells.
2583000	2588000	What does it mean that I am happy or sad?
2588000	2596000	How is the information stored and processed in the human brain?
2596000	2602000	This is actually a very interesting question.
2602000	2610000	But we do not have good tools to study this issue.
2610000	2618000	Currently, there are two ways to detect the action potential on the market.
2618000	2621000	The action potential is actually the electrical signal of these nerves.
2621000	2625000	One method is the multi-electrode array.
2625000	2630000	There are many small electrodes.
2630000	2636000	When the nerve cells are placed on the electrode,
2636000	2639000	the electrodes detect the electrical signals.
2639000	2643000	The other method is the voltage-sensitive array.
2643000	2650000	The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.
2650000	2661000	The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.
2661000	2668000	The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.
2668000	2672000	But two things are important.
2672000	2676000	The first thing is that we do not want the nerve cells to have labels.
2676000	2680000	It is very troublesome to label the nerve cells one by one.
2680000	2685000	The advantage of the multi-electrode array is that it does not need to label.
2685000	2688000	But the trouble is that it is not parallel.
2688000	2694000	Parallel means that you have to connect a line to each electrode.
2694000	2698000	Then use an amplifier to enhance the electrical signal.
2698000	2701000	So you have to use an amplifier for each electrode.
2701000	2705000	This is very difficult and expensive.
2705000	2713000	The advantage of the multi-sensitive array is that it is very parallel.
2713000	2717000	Because you use light to detect the signal.
2717000	2721000	So you just take a camera and keep taking pictures.
2721000	2724000	This thing is very easy.
2724000	2728000	But the other thing is that you have to display each cell.
2728000	2731000	So you need to label the cell.
2731000	2734000	When you label, you will have a lot of problems.
2734000	2738000	Some voltage-sensitive arrays are toxic.
2738000	2741000	It will cause the nerve cells not to respond.
2741000	2746000	Some are said to cause abnormalities in the nerve cells.
2746000	2749000	Even though it is emitting a signal,
2749000	2752000	If it is an abnormal cell,
2752000	2755000	There is no point in studying it.
2755000	2761000	Labeling causes the reaction of the nerve cells to be different.
2761000	2769000	So we want to find a method that is both label-free and parallel.
2770000	2774000	The detection scheme we want is
2774000	2778000	Sensitivity is about 200 microvolts.
2778000	2781000	Spatial resolution is about 10 microns.
2781000	2784000	10 microns is the size of a nerve cell.
2784000	2789000	We want to have real-time detection.
2789000	2793000	The duration is about 1 millisecond.
2793000	2798000	We are a optical detector.
2798000	2802000	So we want to have total internal reflection.
2802000	2809000	Because we want to remove the scattering of nerve cells.
2809000	2812000	Then we start to consider.
2812000	2816000	The first thing to consider is whether your signal-to-noise is enough.
2816000	2823000	Can graphene detect electrical signals from nerve cells?
2823000	2828000	If we use the general method of transmission.
2828000	2831000	When you shine a light,
2831000	2835000	You can imagine that the electrode is a nerve cell.
2835000	2838000	When you add an electrical signal to the electrode,
2838000	2842000	Will the absorption of graphene be changed?
2842000	2851000	We can estimate that the change is about 10 to the power of 4 to 10 to the power of 5.
2851000	2855000	If we want to do this detection,
2855000	2859000	The detection limit is 2 millivolts.
2859000	2863000	This is actually a very bad sensitivity.
2863000	2867000	Because the electrical signals that nerve cells can generate
2867000	2873000	It's usually between tens of microvolts to hundreds of microvolts.
2873000	2876000	This is actually very, very bad.
2877000	2882000	So our question is whether we can increase the modulation depth.
2882000	2888000	The method we use is to put graphene on a planar waveguide.
2888000	2893000	In this picture,
2893000	2900000	Basically, this tantalum pentoxide has a relatively high refractive index.
2900000	2902000	It is our planar waveguide.
2902000	2904000	The light will spread inside.
2904000	2912000	The graphene is placed on the planar waveguide.
2912000	2915000	When the light passes through the graphene,
2915000	2917000	The light will be absorbed.
2917000	2921000	The absorption of light will be changed.
2921000	2924000	The graphene will be changed by the electrical signal.
2924000	2928000	The absorption of light will be changed.
2928000	2936000	The silicon dioxide layer and solution have a relatively low refractive index.
2936000	2940000	The light inside is evanescent.
2940000	2944000	So it will be confined to the planar waveguide.
2944000	2950000	One of the concepts we use is called critical coupling.
2950000	2954000	Basically, it looks like this.
2955000	2959000	We put graphene on the planar waveguide.
2959000	2964000	You can imagine that when the light comes in,
2964000	2967000	Because this is an evanescent wave,
2967000	2972000	The coupling of R1 will go into the waveguide.
2972000	2974000	When it reflects back,
2974000	2976000	Some light will be absorbed by the graphene.
2976000	2978000	So we write it as 1-α.
2978000	2980000	α is the absorption of graphene.
2980000	2983000	So its reflection is R2.
2983000	2988000	It is 1 minus the absorption of graphene.
2988000	2992000	When you consider these multiple interferences,
2992000	2996000	Basically, you can write the electric field in this form.
2996000	3002000	It is the square root of R1-R2 divided by the square root of R1-R2.
3002000	3005000	If you are doing photonics,
3005000	3011000	You will find that this is exactly the same as the ring resonator.
3011000	3016000	Basically, you have a beam of light coming in.
3016000	3022000	The ring resonator has a coefficient of T1 that will go into the waveguide.
3022000	3028000	Here, we have a coefficient of R1 that will go into the waveguide.
3028000	3033000	Here, we have a coefficient of R1 that will go into the waveguide.
3033000	3037000	It goes through an α-absorption.
3037000	3039000	Here is also an α-absorption.
3039000	3041000	It goes back to the ring resonator.
3041000	3046000	If you are familiar with the ring resonator,
3046000	3049000	You will know that this thing has a critical coupling.
3049000	3051000	The meaning of critical coupling is
3051000	3061000	Because the R-absorption of the waveguide can be changed,
3061000	3066000	We set R1 to a constant and change R2.
3066000	3073000	When R1 is a constant, we set it to 0.95.
3073000	3076000	When R2 is small, R1 is about 1.
3076000	3078000	You can put a value in and you will know.
3079000	3084000	When R2 is 1, the reflection is also 1.
3084000	3093000	When R2 is a small or large value, the reflection is large and the absorption is small.
3093000	3098000	But when R2 is equal to R1,
3098000	3104000	There is a place in the middle where the reflection is 0 and the absorption is 1.
3104000	3106000	The picture looks like this.
3106000	3109000	If we can change R2,
3109000	3113000	When R1 is small, the reflectance is large.
3113000	3117000	When R2 is large, the reflectance is also large.
3117000	3123000	But there is a place in the middle where the absorption is very large and it can reach 100%.
3123000	3128000	This is what we call critical coupling.
3129000	3137000	Because R2 is the absorption of graphene,
3137000	3142000	We can use dopamine to change the alpha.
3142000	3147000	Let R2 be equal to R1, then we have the largest absorption.
3147000	3160000	This is what the reflectance looks like.
3160000	3169000	Basically, if we put a neurotransmitter in, the Fermi energy will change slightly.
3169000	3175000	We will see that the reflectivity will also change slightly.
3176000	3179000	The concept is like this.
3187000	3190000	This is our optical setup.
3190000	3195000	Basically, we use a prism to couple into the waveguide.
3195000	3198000	Our light comes in like this.
3198000	3208000	Basically, we look at the reflection of graphene and put it directly into an imaging system or a photodetector.
3216000	3218000	This is an experiment.
3218000	3221000	Basically, we do this.
3221000	3231000	The first thing we do is to use an external voltage to change the Fermi energy of graphene.
3231000	3236000	When you change the Fermi energy of graphene, the absorption of graphene will change.
3236000	3239000	Its relative reflectivity will also change.
3239000	3247000	You can see that when the Fermi energy is small, the absorption of graphene is large.
3248000	3252000	Basically, it will not be coupled in.
3252000	3261000	When the Fermi energy of graphene is large, the absorption will be small.
3261000	3264000	It will not be coupled in, and the reflection will be large.
3264000	3273000	Only when the absorption of graphene is just right, when R1 is equal to R2, there will be critical coupling.
3273000	3277000	The reflectivity of this place will be small, and the absorption will be large.
3279000	3283000	This is the place where the sensitivity is the largest.
3283000	3288000	We put the neurotransmitter in this place.
3288000	3293000	We put the external voltage field in this place.
3293000	3297000	When the neurotransmitter comes in, a light signal will come out.
3299000	3301000	We do this.
3301000	3305000	There is a DC value of 0.5.
3305000	3308000	We add an AC signal on it.
3308000	3312000	We can directly see the change in the reflectivity of graphene.
3312000	3325000	According to our test, we can see that if we give a millivolt AC voltage,
3325000	3330000	the change in reflectivity is about 10 to the power of 2.
3330000	3337000	Compared with the previous transmission method, it has improved by about 100 to 200 times.
3337000	3344000	We can see a change of about 15 microvolts.
3344000	3348000	We can directly see the action potential.
3348000	3354000	This is an imaging demonstration.
3354000	3361000	We can not only see the voltage change at a single point,
3361000	3365000	but also see the voltage change in the whole region, and it is timely.
3367000	3370000	Finally, we do a bio-test.
3370000	3375000	We put a heart cell directly on graphene.
3375000	3378000	We can see the electrical signals.
3378000	3386000	The interesting signals are from the heart.
3386000	3391000	Heart cells can move.
3391000	3395000	There are electrical signals and mechanical signals.
3395000	3400000	We use a chemical called burblast.
3400000	3408000	This chemical will make the heartbeat disappear.
3408000	3411000	There will be no more mechanical beating.
3411000	3415000	We can directly see the electrical signals.
3415000	3424000	This is a biological demonstration.
3430000	3433000	Can you go back to the previous page?
3433000	3434000	This page?
3434000	3439000	Your sharp peak is the electrical signal.
3439000	3444000	The first one is parallel, the third one is parallel, and the fourth one is crooked.
3444000	3448000	This cannot be directly compared.
3448000	3454000	Before we add this chemical,
3454000	3459000	the heartbeat beats very regularly.
3459000	3465000	It beats once every two seconds.
3465000	3469000	However, when you add this chemical,
3469000	3472000	the heart cells die slowly.
3472000	3478000	When we add this chemical, the heart cells die slowly.
3485000	3495000	Finally, we use a camera to see the electrical signals.
3495000	3500000	We can see the electrical signals in the brighter area.
3500000	3502000	There is no electrical signal at the beginning.
3502000	3505000	The electrical signal comes from the left side of the screen.
3505000	3508000	It enters the middle and goes to the right side.
3508000	3511000	It goes beyond the detection range.
3515000	3519000	Each frame is about 5 milliseconds.
3519000	3521000	This is very timely.
3521000	3525000	The frame size is about 1 millimeter.
3525000	3527000	It is very accurate.
3527000	3530000	We demonstrate this method.
3530000	3533000	We can see the electrical signals in one frame.
3533000	3535000	We can see the electrical signals in one frame.
3535000	3538000	In conclusion,
3538000	3543000	we use the properties of graphene.
3543000	3546000	First, it is very sensitive to the environment.
3546000	3549000	Second, it can do doping.
3549000	3553000	Doping can change the optical transition of graphene.
3554000	3558000	We develop optical sensors.
3558000	3567000	The first sensor is the chemical reaction near the graphene electrode.
3567000	3571000	The second sensor is the electrical signal in the graphene.
3571000	3576000	If we put nerve cells or heart cells on the graphene,
3576000	3578000	we hope to see the electrical signals.
3578000	3581000	This is our main work.
3584000	3587000	This is the end of my speech.
3587000	3591000	These are my collaborators.
3591000	3593000	The first one is my boss.
3593000	3598000	These are PhD students or postdocs I have worked with.
3598000	3602000	These are other teachers.
3602000	3605000	Thank you.
3605000	3609000	Let's applaud Jason for his speech.
3610000	3618000	Do you have any questions?
3618000	3621000	Can I ask you a question?
3621000	3623000	Sure.
3623000	3631000	Can you go back to the first two PowerPoint slides?
3632000	3635000	In this setup,
3635000	3639000	you have a prism with light coming in.
3639000	3642000	It interacts with the surface of the graphene.
3642000	3648000	This setup is often used to generate local plasmonic fields.
3648000	3651000	Do you consider this?
3651000	3654000	Or is it something you will look at in the future?
3655000	3664000	The structure looks like local plasmonic.
3664000	3668000	But the concept is completely different.
3668000	3671000	There is no metal here.
3671000	3673000	It's all dielectric.
3673000	3677000	Our focus is on this.
3677000	3683000	We can control the thickness of the evanescent wave.
3683000	3686000	Our focus is on controlling the thickness
3686000	3693000	to change the light coupling coefficient.
3693000	3698000	When you adjust the coefficient to the same as graphene,
3698000	3702000	you can design it to be the same as graphene.
3702000	3705000	This is when the critical coupling occurs.
3705000	3708000	The assumption is 100%.
3708000	3714000	So the sensitivity is theoretically infinite.
3714000	3716000	If all the light is absorbed,
3716000	3722000	a little change will cause a change from 0 to a certain intensity.
3722000	3725000	This is theoretically an infinite sensitivity.
3725000	3734000	This concept is the most important part of this device.
3735000	3737000	I see.
3737000	3745000	We think this is a better way than plasma.
3745000	3751000	We are thinking about using this method to replace plasma.
3751000	3757000	Many people are using plasma enhanced biosensors.
3757000	3760000	Their claim is that they don't need labels.
3760000	3764000	They can do the same thing.
3764000	3768000	But I don't know if their sensitivity is as good as the claim.
3773000	3775000	The main problem with plasma is that it can't be imaged.
3775000	3777000	We can image this.
3778000	3780000	This is correct.
3788000	3793000	The sensitivity we are looking at is similar to plasma.
3793000	3798000	Our system is not yet fully optimized.
3798000	3803000	0.5% of the light is still not absorbed.
3807000	3809000	If you want to optimize this process,
3809000	3811000	what do you need to change?
3811000	3814000	Do you need to change the quality of the substrate?
3814000	3822000	Or do you need to make it more optimized?
3822000	3831000	So far, the only thing that hasn't been absorbed is graphene scattering.
3832000	3836000	Do you mean graphene vibration scattering?
3836000	3840000	Or other photonic scattering?
3840000	3844000	No, graphene is not homogeneous.
3844000	3847000	It's not homogeneous in space.
3847000	3850000	Oh, so there's still a bit of revo on it.
3850000	3852000	I see, I see.
3853000	3858000	So if I have a completely flat graphene,
3858000	3863000	in theory, I can get 100% of it.
3863000	3868000	If you can get the same amount of graphene in every place,
3868000	3872000	then it should be very good.
3872000	3875000	Okay, I see.
3875000	3879000	But the graphene we use here is actually all CVD.
3879000	3881000	It's in the palm of your hand.
3881000	3884000	When it's in the palm of your hand, it's in pieces.
3884000	3887000	There are still some gaps in the middle.
3887000	3889000	I see.
3893000	3897000	So if you use a single crystal graphene,
3897000	3899000	for example, when you turn the CVD,
3899000	3901000	you don't want it to grow very big.
3901000	3903000	If you use a very small graphene,
3903000	3905000	will you get a very good result?
3905000	3907000	You just collect a very small signal.
3907000	3909000	Yes, that's the theory.
3909000	3912000	But what we want to demonstrate is that
3912000	3916000	we can have a large-scale detection.
3916000	3918000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3918000	3920000	If you want to do imaging,
3920000	3922000	you need a large-scale detection.
3922000	3926000	I mean, as long as you don't let the graphene stack up,
3926000	3928000	it may be a very small point.
3928000	3930000	Then if you use the ENCCD to collect the whole thing,
3930000	3932000	you will get the same signal at every point.
3932000	3934000	You will get the same image.
3934000	3936000	As long as you don't let the graphene stack up,
3936000	3938000	it's okay.
3943000	3945000	Yes, that's right.
3945000	3949000	But now I don't know how big a single crystal can grow.
3949000	3955000	I remember it was about 10 to 20 microns.
3956000	3959000	So how big should each data point be
3959000	3963000	for you to collect such a good signal?
3964000	3967000	Oh, you mean...
3967000	3974000	Our spatial resolution can be up to about 10 microns.
3978000	3981000	What is the limit of this thing?
3983000	3992000	For example, at 10 microns or lower,
3992000	3996000	under the ENCCD resolution scale,
3996000	4002000	these five microns...
4002000	4005000	Okay, so in our pixel,
4005000	4007000	it's 10x10 microns.
4007000	4010000	But maybe in some pixels,
4010000	4013000	the graphene coverage is 80%.
4013000	4017000	In some places, the graphene coverage is 50%.
4017000	4022000	Then the response of these two places will be different.
4022000	4026000	When one place is critical coupling,
4026000	4029000	the other pixel will not be critical coupling.
4029000	4031000	Okay.
4031000	4033000	So on average,
4033000	4039000	you won't be completely critical coupling.
4042000	4044000	So have you ever thought about
4044000	4049000	getting a sample out of a tapestry?
4051000	4055000	We haven't thought about it before.
4055000	4058000	Actually, we can try it.
4058000	4060000	Because what we've been thinking about is
4060000	4063000	that we have to find a way to make it very large
4063000	4067000	so that we can see the entire neural network at once.
4068000	4070000	Got it. Thank you.
4074000	4076000	Anyone else have any questions?
4080000	4081000	No questions?
4081000	4083000	Anyone has a question? Sorry.
4083000	4085000	No, thank you.
4085000	4086000	Thank you.
4086000	4087000	Very good talk.
4087000	4088000	Okay.
4088000	4089000	Thank you.
4090000	4092000	If there are no questions,
4092000	4094000	let's give Jason another round of applause
4094000	4096000	for bringing us today's talk.
4100000	4102000	Okay, that's it for today.
4102000	4104000	I'll turn off the recording first.
