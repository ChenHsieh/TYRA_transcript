00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
🦋 subs by bunbunruo 🦋

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, he said the recording is on.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm the host for today, Zhang Lian-Ping.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I just graduated last winter.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I graduated from UNC and did research in social psychology.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I just graduated, so I'm a no-name now.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Before we start today's talk,

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'd like to introduce Project TIRA to you.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As our website says,

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
our goal is to build a timely,

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
cross-national academic information sharing platform

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to exchange academic results and trends in various fields

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
in the overseas and Taiwan academic circles,

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and to provide a platform for effective communication.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
To put it simply,

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we want to build a platform

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to help Taiwan researchers from all over the world

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
communicate with each other.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We hold a weekly online video conference like this.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The speakers are basically our members,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and the topic is research results,

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
field review,

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
future development predictions,

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
sharing new ideas,

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
sharing new ideas,

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and opportunities for cooperation.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TIRA is a fully self-funded,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
volunteer organization.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Our staff are mainly PhD students and post-doctorate students,

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
or people like me,

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
who is in the limbo between a PhD student and a post-doctorate student.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can see more details on our website.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you want to see more,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you can go to our website.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think the key point of a project like this

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is to have open cooperation and opportunities for sharing.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The more people can join us and help each other,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the stronger we will be,

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and the closer we will get to our goal.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you are interested,

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you are welcome to join our members

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and support this idea

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and share our research results.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We also have a Facebook page,

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which I'm sure you all know.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is a non-profit platform

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
for sharing.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I hope you can support us.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is TIRA,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and this is Housekeeping.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's get started.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Today's speaker is Joey Hsiao-Qiao Ying.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Joey graduated from the University of Michigan,

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and is now studying Information Science

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
at the University of Michigan.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He will give a more in-depth introduction later,

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
so I will be brief.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What he is interested in

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is how to use

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
new technology to help immigrants.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think this is US immigrant,

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
immigrants to the US.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How to help them adapt

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
to the new society.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then there is a website.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you are interested,

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you can check it out.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's beautiful.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There are a lot of details

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
about his current projects,

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
presentations, papers, publications.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I won't go into details today.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What I find interesting

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
about this website is

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that it says

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
he is a believer of the strength of weak ties.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is a background.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If you don't know what a weak tie is,

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you should know what a strong tie is.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A strong tie is a social relationship

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we have since we are born.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Some people are your parents,

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
some people are your children.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can't change this.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can't say no.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
By definition, they are your parents.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But a weak tie is

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
when we are born,

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but we can make friends,

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
find partners.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is in line with

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the spirit of Tyra's research.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It also says on the website

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that he is a believer in weak ties.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He likes to make new friends

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and share his research opportunities.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So please help him.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Give him a chance to make friends.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Without further ado,

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
let's give the stage to Joey.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Give me 10 seconds.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll change something.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, take your time.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll say something else.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Give me another 10 seconds.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you have any questions,

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you can leave them in the chat.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can leave them in the chat.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know if Joey can do it.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He might be watching his own video.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So he might not be able to see the chat.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So leave them in the chat.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He will look at your questions

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and answer them.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you can use the chat.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Are you done?

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you done?

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you have anything else to say?

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, I'm done.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going to share my video.

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Can you see the video?

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hello, everyone.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm Joey.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you for the introduction.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm a PhD candidate

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
at UMich.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm a PhD candidate

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
at UMich.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Today, I'm going to share

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
my research

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and my final dissertation.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going to call it

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Not Only New Online,

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but Also New Online.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Technology to Support Immigrant Access

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to Social Capital Adaptation.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What I'm going to talk about

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
is that

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
this research itself

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is not yet designed

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to help immigrants with new technology.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's easier to adapt.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The topic of today's talk

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is still in the exploration stage.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We are looking for their needs.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What can we do

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
to promote

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
web design and app design

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
so that immigrants

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
can use technology more smoothly?

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let me talk about myself.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I just said

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that I'm a PhD candidate

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
at UMich School of Information.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
My field is

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Human-Computer Interaction

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We call it HCI and CSEW.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
HCI is

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Human-Computer Interaction.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In short,

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
we study how humans use technology,

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and how technology affects humans.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We even discuss

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
how to influence human behavior

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
through design.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We often combine psychology,

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
human research,

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and product design

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to develop a foundation.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You may have heard of

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
User Experience, UX,

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
or Chinese User Experience.

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
UX and HCI overlap a lot.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The biggest difference is

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
HCI is usually used in academic research

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
to discuss

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
human-robot,

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
human-technology.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
UX focuses on practical design

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and emphasizes

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
how a product

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
can be used

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
on a commercial level

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and how it can be used

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
through design.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
HCI also has

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Computer-Supported Cooperative Work,

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
CSEW.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
CSEW focuses more on

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
human-to-human interaction

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
than traditional HCI

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that focuses on

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
how technology affects

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
social,

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
community,

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and human-to-human performance.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We often apply

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
social psychology

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to our research.

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
My research

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
focuses on

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
newcomers.

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Newcomers are people

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
who have moved

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
or traveled

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
to a new place

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
for the first time.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My research

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
focuses more on

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
immigrants,

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
but I'm most interested in

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the newcomers.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I often use

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the concept of

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
social capital

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
in my research.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Social capital means

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you have friends

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and social connections.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
These social connections

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
can bring you

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
help and resources.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is social capital.

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Facebook

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and other social media

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
have effectively

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
expanded

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
or enhanced

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
human social capital

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and how people

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
can develop new social capital

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and use social capital

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to get new resources.

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm interested in

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
social capital.

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The third area

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
is related to

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
location-based

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
social media.

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm interested in

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
location-based social media

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
because

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
compared to

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
technology,

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
location-based social media

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
can provide users

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
real-time information

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
provide users

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
real-time

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
social media

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and

265
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
resources.

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
These are

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the three areas

268
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm interested in.

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
These are

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the three areas

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm interested in.

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
a conference

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I published

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
at CSCW

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
last year.

277
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
technologies to

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
support immigration access

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
to social capital

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and adaptation to

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
a new country.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Next slide.

284
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Adaptation

285
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
focuses on

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
immigrants in the U.S.

287
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Millions of immigrants

288
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
come to the U.S.

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
for work, education

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
or their

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
dream in the U.S.

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Immigration is not

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
an easy process.

294
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Immigrants

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
need to make adjustments

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to adapt

297
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to the new environment.

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If adaptation fails,

299
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
they will face

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
mental health

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
or employment

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
issues.

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In order to

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
successfully adapt,

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
immigrants need

306
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
to meet

307
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
many needs.

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We compiled

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
four areas

310
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
in the past.

311
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The four needs

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
immigrants need to meet

313
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
are

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
first,

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
they need to find

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
information

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and resources

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
to meet their basic

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
needs.

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Second,

321
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
they need to face

322
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
financial or

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
work issues.

324
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They need to find

325
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
a job.

326
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Third,

327
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
they need to

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
adapt to

329
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
a new culture

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and language.

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Finally,

332
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
immigrants need to

333
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
meet emotional needs

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
overcome

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
stress.

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Looking back,

338
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
social capital

339
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
includes

340
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
social connections,

341
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
friends, family

342
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and neighbors.

343
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
They can provide

344
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
resources through

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
social connections.

346
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
In the past,

347
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
social capital is

348
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
a very important

349
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
element in

350
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
immigration adaptation.

351
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
In order to

352
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
develop a new

353
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
social capital in

354
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
a new country,

355
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
immigration adaptation

356
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is very important.

357
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In the past few years,

358
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
people have said that

359
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
technology can help

360
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
immigrants develop

361
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
a new social capital

362
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and get

363
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
more resources.

364
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Some studies

365
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
show that

366
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
immigrants adapt

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
to a new

368
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
culture and language

369
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
through technology.

370
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
In the past,

371
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
most studies

372
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
focused on people.

373
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In terms of technology,

374
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
it is not enough

375
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
to study

376
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
how technology

377
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
can change

378
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
or design

379
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
a new society.

380
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
My research

381
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
aims to

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
understand

383
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
how immigrants

384
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
can develop

385
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
a new society

386
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
through

387
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
technology.

388
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
My research

389
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
aims to

390
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
understand

391
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
how

392
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
technology

393
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
can help

394
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
immigrants

395
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
develop
