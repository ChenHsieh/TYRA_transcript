00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Welcome to today's Taira Talk.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Today is February 16, 2019.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Our speaker is Professor Kong Lingjie.

00:14.000 --> 00:31.000
Professor Kong Lingjie is a Vice-Professor of Information Management at National Taiwan University.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
He was a Ph.D. student at Berkley University in the U.S.,

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
and a master's and master's student at National Taiwan University.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
His research focuses on competition theory and professional research,

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
and discusses decision-making in the business sector.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
We are delighted to welcome Professor Kong Lingjie.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Let's welcome Professor Kong Lingjie.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Professor Kong Lingjie.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Thank you all.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Can I start now?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes, you can.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you all for coming to this talk.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
This is a rare opportunity for me.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
When I was a Ph.D. student or when I started teaching,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I would like to listen to all kinds of strange talks.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
The so-called strange talk is different from my own field.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
From a certain perspective, it is very necessary for people like us.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Because we study information management.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Let me briefly introduce information management.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
We study information technology at the Department of Management.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
We want to use information technology to see if we can do something in the field of management.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Basically, it is a cross-field field.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
So we often listen to all kinds of other talks,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
and we can get a lot of inspiration.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Sometimes it doesn't inspire at all, but it doesn't matter.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Just treat it as a broad text.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So when I was a Ph.D. student,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Jason often introduced me to some physics-related knowledge.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Although I almost forgot everything,

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I still feel very happy about this exchange.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
Today, I will use this opportunity to introduce my research field to you.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
This is of course one of the studies, but I personally quite like it.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
It was done by a student of my previous master's class named Liu Qiwei.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
This is actually his master's thesis.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Of course, we did it together in the process.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
As a result, I think this study is still quite good in terms of academic results.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
So a Ph.D. student from NTU or a Ph.D. student who is serious can really achieve quite good results.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay, what is this study about?

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
The theme of this study is called Job Allocation with a Consideration of Fairness.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
It is a work allocation problem that considers fairness.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Let's take a look at what this is about.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Today, when we want to do job allocation, we usually have to consider a lot of issues.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
For example, let's assume that the job is a toy car.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
In general, I am a worker.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I make a toy car.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
If I make a toy car that takes two hours,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I sell it to the buyer, the consumer.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
The buyer will pay me.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
So the job is to spend time to make something, sell it, and change the money.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It's that simple.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
Today, the reason why we started to discuss this topic was probably the year I came back to Taiwan.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
At that time, I met a company in Zhukou.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
There are five or six supply factories.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
There are many factories in Nankou and China.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Sorry, it's not a supply factory.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It's a company that makes LED chips.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
The problem with this company is that its customers will place orders with it.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
For example, this order says I want 100 toy cars.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Or how many LED chips do I want?

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
The company's owner is responsible for allocating work to each factory.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
When allocating work, there will be a so-called fairness issue.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Every factory wants to fight for the so-called better order.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Some orders have a work load.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
That is, you have to spend a lot of time.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Benefit is that the cost-effectiveness or the degree of easy-to-earn money is very low.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
For example, some relatively traditional things are produced.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
This kind of profit is small and time-consuming to do.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Everyone doesn't like this.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Or, for example, the yield rate is very low when doing it.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It's difficult and everyone doesn't like it.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
So these factory managers are all going to be reviewed in the end.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Then they will really happen.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
They will go to the head of the company and scold him.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Why is this order divided to others and not to me?

05:17.000 --> 05:26.000
So from that time on, I realized that when this work allocation happened between people.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
He did encounter some interesting issues.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
It is not encountered in traditional work allocation.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Traditional work allocation is usually at the beginning.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Whether it's an employee or a public person.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
They are talking about this work allocation.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
It's more often that I assign the work to the machine or the CPU.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Then they naturally don't have any fair or unfair questions.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Does everyone listen to you?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
When you assign work to people, people will definitely care about fairness.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
In addition to caring about their own workload and their own revenge.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
I care about how I compare with others.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
It's probably like this.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
That's why everybody wants to earn more money.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
So in the food problem just now.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Motivate us to do this study.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
After that, we slowly simplified it into the following topics.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
In other words, we will have a lot of work.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Every work will have the time it takes.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And how much money can be made after this work.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
For example, it takes two hours to make this small car.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Then you can make so much money.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
It takes 2.5 hours to make this medium car.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
You can make more money.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
The big car is the most advanced.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
It takes 4.5 hours to make the most money.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
So there are all kinds of work.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Some are more difficult to do.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Some make more money.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Then we have a lot of so-called factories.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
Their capacity is limited.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
You can't give all the work to the same factory.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
So in this problem.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
We want to do work allocation.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Then you might think.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Is there any other situation?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I also want to do this kind of work allocation.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
In fact, there are quite a few.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Here are a few examples.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
These examples were later seen one after another.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
The first example is Kaohsiung Port.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Kaohsiung Port is a project we are discussing now.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Kaohsiung Port is probably like this.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
We are talking about the so-called flood.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
If you don't know much about flood.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
If you are interested, you can google it.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Is to find out what the flood is doing.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Probably like this.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Suppose there is a boat here today.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
This boat wants to come to Kaohsiung Port.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Then stop like this.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
The route I am drawing now is Port 2.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
This place is Port 1.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Port 1 is closer to the north.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So this is near Shanduoshang Circle.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
This place is probably like this.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
This one here.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Is a miracle that everyone may have been to.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
In short.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
When this boat wants to come in now.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
He can't come in directly.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
He must be in this place.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Waiting for the flood people to go up.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Flood people are those who live near the pier.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
The senior captain.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
They used to have many years of boat.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
The experience of running around everywhere.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Then later.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
After turning into a flood person.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
They will live near the port.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
When there is a boat coming in.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Flood people will be in the open sea.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Will take a small boat to the open sea.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Temporarily take over this boat.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
With the captain of that boat.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Drive the boat in.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
The reason for the need for flood people.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Of course it is because of a port.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Local people know better.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So these people in Kaohsiung Port.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Or flood people.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
They know more about the situation in Kaohsiung Port.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Then inside Kaohsiung Port.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
The setting of this port.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
And so on.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So he can bring the boat in like this.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It's the same to take it out.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Then the boat moves between the pier.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
It's the same.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
All need flood people.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
In terms of the size of Kaohsiung Port.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Kaohsiung Port has about 40,000 boats a year.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Then there are 40 flood people.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Then they are obviously.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
All the work in this year.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
It's going to be divided to these 40 flood people.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
There are more than 100 boats on average every day.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Then there are more than 100 boats.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Come in and out.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Scattered within 24 hours.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Then these flood people.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm going to finish them one by one.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
That's it.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Why is there a so-called fairness problem here?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
A boat comes in.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
A flood person to bring.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Some boats are difficult to bring.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
For example, a boat carrying oil.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Boat carrying dangerous goods.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Or a super big boat.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
This kind of boat is difficult to bring.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Some boats are very simple.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Then it's more troublesome to get to the port.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
It's easy to get out of the port.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Everyone imagines parking on the side of the road.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Of course, parking on the side of the road is easy to drive out of the road.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It's hard to park.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
So it's obvious that your work is simple and difficult.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
So there are different bonuses.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
What about the flood people?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
He gets some bonuses every time he brings a boat.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That's tens of thousands of dollars less.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Hundreds of thousands of dollars more.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
This amount is amazing.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
It's a lot worse.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
So for the flood people.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
If they want to allocate their work.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
What they care about most is not the degree of overtime.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Or the relationship between me and the merchant.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
They all consider these.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
But what they care about most.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Or something that can't be ignored.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Is it fair to divide these jobs?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I can't do some races every time I go.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Then do something that is difficult to do.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
The salary is relatively low.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Then give it to him every time it's done.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
That won't work.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
So this is an example of job allocation.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I divide the work.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Everyone has to be able to eat and play.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Can't risk driving.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
At the same time, we have to consider everyone's so-called money.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Can't be too different.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Or can't be too different from his job.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
A similar example is a massage shop.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
There will be a lot on the side of the road.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Whether he is a blind man or not.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Or this is a special massage for you to relax.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Then you can relax after work.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
This kind of massage shop.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Massage shop is generally you go in.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It's quite a job.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Then there are a bunch of massage masters inside.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Usually there are a few people in turn.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
So they have to be divided.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Some shops will use the way of turning around.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
The way of turning around may be good or bad.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
But it's the same.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
He will definitely encounter a problem of fairness.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
You can't do the same job every time.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Then give it to another person.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
Finally, there is the so-called social enterprise.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
The meaning of the word social enterprise is probably to say.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
The purpose of the establishment of this company.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Is to promote social welfare.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Instead of his own company to make the most money.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
For Taiwan.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Just give an example.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
There is a company called Dazhi Culture.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
He basically sells the so-called Dazhi magazine.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
This is called Big Issue.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
This is not unique to Taiwan.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
His feature is.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
He put the newspaper magazine.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
This is the Dazhi magazine.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
He handed it to the tourist.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Let the tourist sell it.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
This mechanism itself is not the point.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
The point is.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Since you are giving these jobs to the so-called tourist.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Of course, your goal is to hope that every tourist can make a certain amount of money.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Instead of maximizing the company's total profits.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
So in many of these examples.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
We can all see.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Basically there is a person.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
He is a central control unit.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
He is responsible for the distribution of work.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
The traditional distribution of work is.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I have some subordinates.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I will divide the work.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
They will be obedient.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Then they will finish their work after they have finished listening.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Then we have profits.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
There is a revenge, etc.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Then I maximize my personal total profits.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
It used to be like this.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
But in some topics.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
For example, in this topic we consider.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
You can also see that a lot of time.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
The distribution of work is not actually concerned about overall efficiency.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
In fact, it is fairness.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
If that's the case.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Maybe you need a new way.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Or you need to adjust the old way.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
It's probably like this.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
So, uh.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
In terms of this question.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Job this thing can be said to be a love and hate.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
On the one hand, it is that you have to spend time doing your job.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
But it is also a precious resource.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Because doing the job is making money.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
So, we have to use a good way.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Divide the job to our work units.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Then we are on the word.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I will still call these work units machine.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Because in this schedule.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Scheduling in this field.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
That's what everyone calls it.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Just call him a machine.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
But we know ourselves.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Our so-called machine is here.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
More like an agent or an employee.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Like this.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
So, we don't just consider.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
We don't just want to maximize the total profit.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
The main thing is to consider fairness.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
So, our machine will have the so-called limited capacity.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
It's just you.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
One day's work is limited.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
So you can't do more than your load.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Work.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
So, we.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
The setting in this place is.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
As long as you have enough capacity.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Then you will want to do more work.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
Just like a masseur or a waterman.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
So, you are on duty today.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Then, as long as your workload can be replenished.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
You want to do a little more.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Make more money.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
That's probably what it means.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Then, we assume that the work cannot be split.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That depends on the situation.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
But in the example we just talked about.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Massage master usually.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
His work will not be divided.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
You go in.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Someone will give you a foot massage.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Or someone will help you relax your shoulders.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
He won't relax his shoulders until two-thirds.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Suddenly change the next person.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Right?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
It's usually like this.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
That's not to mention Kaohsiung Port.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
He helped you bring the boat in from the sea.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Stop well.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
He won't change a waterman halfway.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
This is a waste of time.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
So, we assume here.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Job can't be divided.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
In some cases, of course.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
For example, there is a customer who orders with me.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
He wants 100 toy cars.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Of course, I can give it to factory A and factory B.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Each makes 40 and 60.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Right?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
But in terms of food.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Sometimes the company doesn't want to split the order like this.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Because it's obvious that it's going to cause some homework.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Difficulties and troubles.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
In addition to the academic.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
We can easily prove.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
If the work of this problem can be freely distributed.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
And if there is no cost.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Then this problem will be very.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
The existing method can be easily solved.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
So whether from the perspective of food or from the perspective of theory.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Support us to do this setting.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
In some cases, work can't be divided.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Then we will also discuss this point.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
So the overall goal of our question is.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
I want to maximize this so-called minimum benefit.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Among machines.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
This thing is a core setting of our topic.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
So let's talk about it.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Why are we doing this?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Uh, basically.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I have a question.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
You can come.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Uh, I can't split that assumption.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
It will lead to that.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Because you just said that if you can split it.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
It can be easily solved.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
So what you mean is.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
For example, if you can split it to infinity.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Basically, it's a concept of division.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
You divide it by how many agents in total.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Then that's it.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Is it like this?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
A little bit more complicated than that.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Uh, that's what we're doing today.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
First, from a technical point of view.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Uh, we'll show you the mathematical model later.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
So you'll see that we're going to have a whole number of planning problems.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
So if the work can be divided today.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It will become a linear planning problem.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That linear planning problem already has.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Uh, everyone can accept it.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
A good way to solve it.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Uh, so this is.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
A more academic answer.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
So what you just said is.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
So-called it's all gone.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Similar similar.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Uh, although it's not a very.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It's not always possible to get the best solution.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
But it's almost the same concept.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
So that's it.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
If today's job can be.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Any partition.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
And then to infinity.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
And then there's no cost.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
If you want to divide it by a few points.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Indeed, this problem does not need to be studied.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Like this.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Is that okay?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Did I turn it on?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Oh, I turned it on.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Hey, can you hear me now?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
There is.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Oh, okay.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
So good.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Then I have another small problem.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I just got that.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
The other small problem is.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
If you have this assumption.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It sounds like it's still you.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You're still going to use it next.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Right?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Or will you say.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
It's going to be like throwing some.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
For example, like.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Material simulation.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
And then run some.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
What kind of simulation?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
And then look at some.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
The results of the statistical distribution.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Still.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
You will still tend to.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Is to calculate the result.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
OK.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah, because you just said.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
OK, good.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
That's it.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Thank you.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Thank you.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
That's right.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
That's what we're going to do.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
This study is basically.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
A study of homework.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That is, as you will see later.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The main task is.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Write a mathematical model to describe this problem.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And help him write a algorithm.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Oh, uh, you just mentioned Monte Carlo.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Ah, this value simulation and so on.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Because of our problem.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
You'll see it later.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
We are a deterministic problem.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
So, uh, you don't need to use these.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Uh, statistical distribution, and so on.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
It's basically a standard algorithm problem.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Oh, but we'll talk about it later.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Then we'll see you later.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
That's above this line.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Basically, it's about the setting of our topic.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
We have a bunch of jobs.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
We have a bunch of so-called machine or agent.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
And then, uh, we think about the so-called fairness that agent cares about.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
That fairness needs a measurement.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
That is, after we distribute the work, they make money.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
After that, we need to measure the so-called fairness.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
There are many ways to measure fairness.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
For example, there are people in academia who do this.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
That is, everyone makes money.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
The person who makes the most money.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Don't make the most.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Don't make too much.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Or the person who makes the most and the person who makes the least.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Don't be too different.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Or the money everyone makes.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Don't be too big.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Oh, and so on.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
So you can write a lot of goals.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
For example, I minimized.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Maximum benefit.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It means that I have ten people.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
And then everyone makes money.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
That ten people make the most money.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
See how much money he makes.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I'm going to minimize the money he makes.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Or I minimized.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Maximum benefit.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Minimum benefit.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Like this.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh, there's one person who makes the most.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
There's one person who makes the least.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And then we're going to minimize this gap.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Or I'm going to minimize.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Variance of benefit.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Oh, that's fine.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
These things are OK.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
But in our topic.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
If we choose these goals.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
Then we have to deal with benefit at the same time.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm sorry.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
We have to deal with fairness and efficiency at the same time.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
It's going to be a lot of trouble.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Why?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Because if we use these goals.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Then the best solution will become very natural.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Don't do all the work.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Don't do it all.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Everyone makes $0.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
This is also the best.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
This is also the best.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
This is also the best.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
All the goals are optimized by you.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Can't be optimized anymore.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
But efficiency is 0.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
It will become that.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
We have to use other ways to limit.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
We can't give up our overall efficiency completely.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
So, in the end, we use this.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
The goal is this.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
This is my job for everyone.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Everyone makes money.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
I see which unlucky guy makes the least.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm going to maximize that unlucky guy.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I make money.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
If that's the case.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
First of all, the poorest person will not be too poor.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The worst person will not be too bad.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
This is quite in line with our fair intuition.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
The second is if you want to maximize as much as possible.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
The money of the person who makes the least money.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Naturally, other people will not make much more than him.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Because in this case, this goal will not be satisfied.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
That's the end.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
If my goal is to maximize the minimum benefit.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
In fact, we will show it to you at the end.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
The overall efficiency will not be too different.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
We can ask the same question.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
I maximize efficiency or maximize fairness.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
If we use this setting to maximize fairness.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
That efficiency will not go anywhere.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
That's about it.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
So we will start with this goal.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Then we are today.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Uh, because, uh, most of us.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
This friend is not doing the so-called research in this field.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
So, of course, we choose the gold.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
How do you say it?

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
It's easier to understand.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
So I'll do a few more things later.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
I'm going to write down the formulation of this problem.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You mean to use simple mathematical formulas.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Let's define exactly what I just said.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
After that, there is a model.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
It will allow us to prove that it is NP-hard.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
That NP-hard is a CS.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
Or, uh, it's the word used by people in the field of computer science or research.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
That's probably what I mean.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
I want to prove that this problem is very difficult.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, is it that we can't look forward to it?

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
You can get the best result within a reasonable time frame.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
So we're going to design a so-called heuristic.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
That is to say, oh, this problem is so difficult that we can't find the best solution.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
So let's find a feasible solution.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
And then we'll take a look at this feasible solution.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Let's analyze its performance.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
It's probably like this.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
That analysis of performance is, uh, how do you say it?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
It's also very difficult.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
So we're just going to pick one of the little parts of our whole study.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
It's the easiest part to understand, but it's also the most essential part to share with you.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
That is to say, the same problem.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
You can also design a heuristic.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I can also design a heuristic.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
He can also design a heuristic.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
It's easy to design a heuristic.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.000
But what we want to do is to find the theoretical nature of our heuristic.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
See how good it can be or how bad it can be.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
Hopefully, this will give us a better understanding of the heuristic.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
That's about it.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Okay.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
So let's formulate this problem.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Uh, our field is called homework research.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Operations research.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
At the beginning, it was.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
Linear programming that everyone learned when they were young.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
If you have no impression of linear programming, you probably did something like this when you were a kid.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
You have x and y.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
And then they're limited.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
That is, for example, x plus 2y.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Uh, sorry, this is 2x plus y.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
And then x plus 2y, and then x plus 2y, and then x plus 4, and so on.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
So you're going to have a feasible region, x is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and so on.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
And then you're supposed to have a goal, like I want to maximize x plus y.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, well, then you're going to have a line, and then you're going to push it this way, and then you're going to get the best solution.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
This thing is linear programming.

25:21.000 --> 25:30.000
Generally speaking, the homework research method is that I try to write the problem into linear programming, non-linear programming, and so on.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
And then we use all kinds of methods to solve it.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
So now we're going to do something similar.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
I'm going to define my decision problem.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
The goal is limited and there are character variables.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
So let's go back to the topic we just talked about.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
I have a group of people, agents or machines.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It's my work unit.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
And then I have a group of jobs that I'm going to divide.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
And then, today, I have a few jobs.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I have a few machines.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
So m is machine, and the other symbol n is job, like this.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
And then I have a limit on every machine.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
I work eight hours a day, this kind of thing.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
So I have a limit on my work time.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
This is called K, called Capacity.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Every job has the work time it needs.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
So it's called CJ.

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
This is usually called Processing Time in Scheduling Literature.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
How long does this job take to finish?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And then JobJ.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
JobJ has its benefit, which is how much money I can get after I'm done.

26:43.000 --> 26:50.000
So our task is to determine the so-called XIJ.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
XIJ is a so-called 0-1 variable.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
It's for every job and every machine.

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
I ask myself if I'm going to let machine I do JobJ.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
If so, that means I'm going to assign J to I.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Then I'm going to set its value to 1.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Otherwise, I'm going to set it to 0.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Something like this.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Now that we have this role variable,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Let's see how we're going to describe what we just talked about.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
The target room, the limit room, and so on.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
This problem is very simple to describe.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Let's look at the bottom here.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
The first thing is that for every machine or every agent.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
The total workload I assign to it cannot exceed its work time.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
How do you say that?

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
XIJ is equal to 1, which means I assign J to I.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
So I ask every job,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Did I assign J to this I?

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
If so, then this work time has to be added up.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
So the total work time I get cannot exceed the amount I can recover.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
This is the limit room 1.

27:57.000 --> 28:07.000
The limit room 2 is that every job is assigned to at most one machine.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
So I look at all the machines that I may be assigned.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
XIJ can only have one person at most.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
Here, XIJ, we set it to be either 0 or 1.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
It can't be 0.3 or 0.8 or something like that.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
This means that this work cannot be divided.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
The final goal is here.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
I want to maximize the so-called minimum benefit.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
How do you say that?

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
For every I, for every machine,

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
I'm going to calculate how much benefit I get.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
If XIJ is 1, it means I got that job.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
I got that job, I did it, and then I got this benefit.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
So XIJ is the benefit I get.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
You earn $8, I earn $5, he earns $16.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
The unluckiest of us is $5.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
The goal value is 5.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
I want to maximize the money earned by the least amount of money.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
It's probably like this.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
So this place.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
There are a few values.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
It's here.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Let's review it.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
I basically maximize the minimum total benefit among machines.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Then the first one is capacity constraint.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
That is, my work time is limited.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
The second one is job can be done only once.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
So it's a job that can only be done once.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
It can only be distributed to one person.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
And then finally, the job can't be split.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
It's probably like this.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Let's jump out here and talk about a few things.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
We have a few settings here.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
BJ, CJ and K.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
This is equivalent to assuming that each machine is exactly the same.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
So their work time constraints are the same.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
And then every job is, uh, every job is assigned to you or assigned to me.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
The profit is the same.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
And then how long does each job take?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
It's the same.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
These settings are sometimes established and sometimes not.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
For example, K.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
What about K?

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
If I'm talking about a massage master today, it's not necessarily.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Some people might be able to do it for eight hours a day.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Some people can only do it for four hours a day, right?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
BJ is doing a job today.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
How much can you charge the customer?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
This may be the same.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Massage master.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
But this one person comes in.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Then you press, you are 400 yuan, I press, you are 400 yuan.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
OK.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
That CJ is not necessarily the same.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Not necessarily the same or not the same.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
For example, a massage master is usually a job.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
30 minutes, 20 minutes, and so on.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
So that CJ will naturally be the same.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
But if today is, for example, a drinker, a drinker.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
Some people have better skills, some people are faster, some people are slower.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
This is possible.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
But in the end, in fact, we have done it before.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
K, you can make it different for everyone.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
This is OK.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
CJ, you can become C.I.J.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
BJ, you can become B.I.J.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
As long as you meet some reasonable settings, this problem can still be dealt with.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
But today, because of the time limit, we don't talk so much.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
We just assume that BJ is the same for everyone.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
CJ is the same for everyone.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
The so-called everyone is the same.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
It's divided for you or for me.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
We make the same money.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That's what it means.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
And then finally, K, everyone is the same.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Let's assume this thing.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
Then, uh, I just mentioned that if this job can be divided.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Then this place will become X.I.J.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Between 0 to 1.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
At this time, this problem is that you can move a little bit more.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
It will become a linear program.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
It becomes a linear program.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
That linear program will be the general commercial server.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
It can be solved.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Well, there's nothing to study about this problem.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Okay, so today, uh, I'm going to skip it.

31:59.000 --> 32:07.000
So today, after that question, in our field, first of all, we have to prove that this question is NP-hard.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
The meaning of NP-hard, of course, I'm not going to talk about the details here.

32:10.000 --> 32:16.000
But what it means is that if you can prove that a problem is NP-hard.

32:16.000 --> 32:25.000
It means that people in the academic world basically recognize that this problem is not the best solution within a reasonable time range.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
You mean that the complexity of this problem is very high.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
That's probably what it means.

32:29.000 --> 32:38.000
Okay, so the question just now, if you're not in this field, it's probably hard to imagine why it's so complicated.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
Okay, why is it so difficult to get the best solution?

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
So let's just describe this proof a little bit.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
So here's the problem.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm going to assume that my question just now is a little bit simpler.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
A special case.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
There are actually only two machines in this special case.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
And these two machines are uncapacitated, which means that their workload is infinitely large.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Or far larger than all the workload.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
So in this case, our problem will become the so-called partition problem.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
What does it mean?

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
My workload is already limitless.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
So the workload limit no longer exists.

33:18.000 --> 33:26.000
I only care about how many benefits these jobs will get.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
Work 1 can earn $3, work 2 can earn $4, and so on.

33:30.000 --> 33:39.000
And then my fairness issue is that I'm going to divide this pile of benefits as evenly as possible to two people, right?

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
It's best to stack it up like this.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
This problem is called partition problem in mathematics or computer science.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
I give you a bunch of integers and you divide it into two piles.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Try to make these two piles the same size.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
In fact, this problem is NP-hard.

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
As long as you have enough numbers, you can't find a good answer to this problem.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
You divide it, you divide it, but you can't tell.

34:02.000 --> 34:08.000
And then you can't even tell if they can be divided into two piles of the same size.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
It can't be done in a reasonable amount of time.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
So even partition can't do it.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Our problem is more difficult than partition.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's just that we can't do it any more.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
That's about it.

34:21.000 --> 34:28.000
Well, in that case, let's find a heuristic algorithm.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
This thing is what I'm doing now.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
Hey, I have a question.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Can you go back to the last page?

34:38.000 --> 34:46.000
But the problem you have to deal with is that you just have to maximize the minimum benefit.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
You don't have to be partition.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
In this case, it's still NP-hard.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
Can you fully correspond to this partition problem?

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Hey, that's a good question.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
We're maximizing the minimum benefit.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
So we're doing this thing in general.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
But when we only have two machines.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
We're going to want to make them as big as possible, right?

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah, if we can't make it the same size.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Then this thing is not fair in some sense.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.000
Or the way we can maximize the minimum benefit is to make them the same size.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
That's a good answer.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
But you might have that thing.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Okay, I know.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Let me correct this partition problem.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
It has two versions.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Version one is that I give you a bunch of numbers.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Ask you if you can divide them into a pile of the same size.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Version two is that I give you a pile of numbers.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
You help me minimize the difference between these two numbers.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Like this.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
OK.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
And then these two questions are all in the same place.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
In fact, version one is relatively simple.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Version one is the decision problem.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
It's a yes or no.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Version two is the optimization problem.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
You have to find a set of distribution methods.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
So our question is version two of the expansion version.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Like this.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
OK, good.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Thank you.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
OK, and then it's here.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
So today we're basically not going to look for the best solution.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
So we're going to look for the so-called feasible solution.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Use heuristic algorithm.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Heuristic is an inspiration algorithm in Chinese.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
It's actually an experience law.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
There's a lot of numbers here.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
How do you divide it better?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Well, I don't know.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
But why don't you just divide it like this?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
It's usually pretty good.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
That's probably what it feels like.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Heuristic algorithm sounds like a waste from an academic point of view.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
It's just that if it's a very, very simple rule-based algorithm,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
People think it sounds like it's very simple.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Is that really okay?

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
But in fact, it's almost always done that.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Uh, for the example of Kaohsiung Port.

37:12.000 --> 37:18.000
When we were discussing with them, we said, oh, that sounds like a job allocation problem.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
So let's design the algorithm.

37:20.000 --> 37:27.000
And after a while, they found out that they were very worried that the algorithm would be blacked out.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
That is to say, someone wrote a software to do the job allocation.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
What if the person who wrote the software colluded with a few of them?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
And then it's a lot of favoritism.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
What do you do with those inspirations?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Yeah, there's no way to solve it.

37:39.000 --> 37:46.000
So that's to say, if this algorithm is implemented into the job allocation between the drinkers,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
The algorithm must be very simple and easy to explain.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Everybody can understand.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
So today, when a job is assigned to A instead of B,

37:55.000 --> 38:02.000
The file with the history record and the algorithm must be able to explain why it is assigned to A instead of B.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
There is such a requirement.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
So in this case, it becomes that you can't use a complicated algorithm.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
You have to use a relatively simple but effective algorithm.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
So you can't use that kind of neural network.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You just have to use a relatively simple algorithm.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
And then it can get a certain effect.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
Okay, so let's find a simple algorithm.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
But what if you want to design an algorithm for that question?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Look at the file.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
So look at the file.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
In 1966, someone studied a very similar problem.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
You have a bunch of machines.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
They all look the same.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
But you have to minimize and make span.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
What does that mean?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
That is, you have a bunch of jobs.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
These jobs all have the so-called CJ, which is workload.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
So every job has to spend a certain amount of time.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
At that time, there was no benefit in that problem.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
You just divide a bunch of work into a bunch of machines.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
And then hope to minimize the total time of the machine that takes the longest.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
So this problem is on the academic side.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
It's kind of like this kind of problem.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And then there was a man.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
He did a similar problem in 1982.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
He's the same.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
There's only workload at work.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
But he's the one who maximizes the satisfaction of that person.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
That is to say, after the job is done, there is a person who does the least.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
I'm going to maximize his work.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
So.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
These two questions are very similar, right?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
It's a bunch of work.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It takes time.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
Graham, he's the one who minimizes the longest.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Dual Mayor is the one who maximizes the shortest time.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
But in short, it's all about fairness as far as possible.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
So the way they use it is very simple.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
That is to say, uh, what we use today is called LPT.

40:06.000 --> 40:12.000
This algorithm is that I arrange the work from large to small.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
According to the formula.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
And then after the sequence, we start to divide the big work.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
Every time you want to divide it, you divide it to the most comfortable and relaxed person at the moment.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
It's probably like this.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
And then it's over.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
This algorithm is very intuitive.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
If you divide it to the most comfortable person every time.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
Then his current total work is the smallest.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Of course, you'll be the most balanced.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
And then the work has to be arranged from large to small.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
That makes sense, too.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Because small work can finally insert air.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So let's take a look at the example.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Suppose I have four jobs and two machines.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
The four jobs are 7542.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
And then I have two empty machines.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That 7542 has been arranged, right?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
So the workload is 7.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm going to give it to the machine.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
At this time, I'm going to give it to the machine.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Because the machine is more comfortable now.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
He just didn't work.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
And then the next thing is work 3.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Work 3 is going to be given to the machine.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Because the current workload of the machine is relatively small.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
And then the last job 2.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Of course, the job 2 is given to the machine.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
So that's how simple the algorithm is.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
So based on their longest processing time.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Then we'll fix it a little bit.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
We'll change it to Capacitated Highest Benefit Job First.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
It's called CHBF.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
This method is to say.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
We have the so-called benefit today.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And then there's no, uh, sorry.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
And then our goal is to balance the benefit.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
So when we arrange the jobs from large to small.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
It's in the order of benefit.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
OK.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
After we're done, every time we're going to divide the job.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
Just divide it to the current accumulated benefit.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
The smallest job.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
We'll give it to him.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
So when you divide it, you have to see if it has capacity.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
If the capacity is not enough.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Then we'll give it to the second順位.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And then we'll give it to the third順位.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
And so on.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Well, you've been doing this thing over and over again.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Until we finish the job.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
The so-called division is also possible.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
It's not finished.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
Because every machine has a capacity limit.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
So there are some jobs that can't be done in the end.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
It's also very possible.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
Well, if a job can't be given to any machine.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Then we'll throw it away.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
It's probably like this.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
So.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
Uh, in academia, we can easily analyze the complexity of this problem.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
But even if you don't write that formula to analyze.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
It's okay.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
It looks very simple.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Job sequence.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
And then we divide the divide divide divide divide divide divide.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
So this method is very easy to implement.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Well, suppose we have this today.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
The same.

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
We have two jobs and, uh, sorry, four jobs and two machines.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
So let's try it.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
The capacity of these two machines is eight.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Uh, at most, you can only do eight hours of work.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
And then, four jobs, nine dollars each.

43:10.000 --> 43:17.000
Nine dollars, five hours, six dollars, six hours, three dollars, three hours, two dollars, two hours.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Two.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
So we're going to start with this nine-dollar job.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Take it first.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Okay, so he'll give it to the machine first.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
And then the six-dollar one is given to the machine.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
And then there's the three-dollar one, right?

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
The three-dollar one is supposed to be given to the machine.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Because the machine only makes six dollars at the moment.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
But I can't divide it when I want to.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Because he can't eat it.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Then he had to give it to the machine.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
And then the last one was given to the machine.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
So this algorithm is probably running like this.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Okay, so that's what today's questions are.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It's just a random question for you.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It's easy for you to design algorithms.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
But it's very difficult for you to show him good.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
So what's good?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
There are usually two kinds of measured indicators.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm going to finish these two pages.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
That's about it.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
That is to say, I randomly give you 10 million jobs.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
And then you just, uh, I randomly produce these jobs.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
You just give me a row.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
And after that, we can calculate the target market value.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
How much is it, right?

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
At the same time, we can also find some benchmark algorithms.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Let's compare it with everyone.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
So we have 100 people.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
100 people each propose 100 algorithms.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
So we just throw it down every time.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
And then it depends on whose algorithm usually performs better.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Okay, so that's the first plan.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
The second plan is that we use a more theoretical proof.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
The method is to find the worst case performance of the algorithm.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
What he means is probably that for your proposed algorithm.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
Can you prove that no matter what strange instance is thrown to you.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
Your performance can be good to a certain extent.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
That is to say, I know that my algorithm will not find the best solution.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
But no matter how bad it is, it can't be bad to a certain extent.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
That's probably what it means.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
What about us?

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
This so-called worst case performance guarantee.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
If you can find it.

45:14.000 --> 45:21.000
It can give us some psychological confidence when we use algorithms.

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
In other words, I also know that the algorithm I found is not the best solution.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
But it's not too far from the best solution.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
That's probably what it means.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Okay, so.

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
We used to have Graham, this dual mayor.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
They all found the so-called performance guarantee.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
In Graham's case, I'm going to do my job today.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
I'm going to minimize make spend.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
Minimize the total cost of the person who does the longest.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
At that time, he can prove that his algorithm's performance guarantee is 4.4.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
133% means that if the best solution is 100.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
He will find at least 133 or less.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Because it's a minimization problem.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
So the smaller your target market value, the better.

46:12.000 --> 46:17.000
He can guarantee that his solution is at most one-third of the best solution.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
That dual mayor.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Sorry.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
The dual mayor is that his problem is the other way around.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
So it becomes three quarters.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
In other words, if the best solution is 100.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
Your mayor's solution is at least 75 or more.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
That's probably what it looks like.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
And then there were some other people who did some refinement.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
So our goal is the same.

46:36.000 --> 46:41.000
We want to help our algorithm find a performance guarantee like this.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
As a result, of course there is.

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
We have this performance guarantee in all kinds of situations.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
So let's just talk about one.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
That is to say, if today our job benefit.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
With workload is a linear relationship.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
That is to say, a car is 5 yuan, two cars are 10 yuan, three cars are 15 yuan.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
If you do a few hours, you will get various benefits at the bottom of the line.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Oh, if it's this situation.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Then our algorithm.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
We can guarantee one-third.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
That is to say, if the best solution is 100.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
Then we can do at least 50 or more.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
That's probably what it looks like.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Then there is a vote here.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Then I'll skip this one.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
Then we want to emphasize one thing.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
That is.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
The best solution is 100.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Then you guarantee more than 50.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
It sounds pretty good, right?

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Oh, at this time.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
We have to explain one thing.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
That is, 50 is actually the most ideal situation.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
That is to say, one-third of the guarantee is the limit of our algorithm.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Oh, what do you mean?

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
Suppose I have a lot of machines today.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Then these machines, they are basically.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Uh, he.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Suppose I have several machines.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
M machine.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Then I have two M plus one job.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Among them.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
A lot of work.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
2M work is just half the capacity.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Only a little bit bigger.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Then if today is.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
To do this allocation.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Then I use my algorithm.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I'll put the biggest one in first.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Then this one will just fit.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Can't fit any other work.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
The other machines will just fit two.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Two.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Oh, so my solution.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
It's probably half of the best solution.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
That's what it means.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
We just found 1 in 2.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
This solution, this performance guarantee.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
There's no way to improve it any more.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Oh, this is the limit.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
But there's still no way to answer.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Some of the other people's questions.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
It's just that you might think.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
One-half is still very small.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
The maximum solution is 100.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
You can only find 50.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Does that really work?

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
At this time, we can do some later.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Value experiment.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
To prove that he is actually.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
In average, it's usually not too bad.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Oh, so like this kind of research.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
I'm going to do a numerical study later.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
That is, then we will randomly produce a pile of instances.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Throw it to this algorithm.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
And then, after the algorithm spit out the solution.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
We're going to throw this pile of instances into a server.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Let the server run for three days and three nights.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Find the best solution.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
And then let's take a look at my algorithm.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
0.2 seconds out.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
With the server running for three days and three nights.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
The best solution that came out.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
How much difference is there?

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
That's basically through all kinds of research.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
It's probably all about this relationship.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Oh, here.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
That is to say.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Our algorithm.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
The fairness index found.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
With the fairness index found by the best solution.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
It's usually two percent.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
Four percent, eight percent, and so on.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
And then?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Uh, in some particularly.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
In a tight situation.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Our algorithm.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
The worst of the worst is probably to find 90 percent.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Around the solution.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
That is to say, the best solution is 100.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
He found 90.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
It's probably like this.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
And then in a relatively easy-to-handle situation.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
He can find 98 percent, 97 percent, and so on.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Oh, that's because the time is up.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
So I'm not going to go into the details.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
But generally speaking, what we do in this type of research.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
It's just like that.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
You have a problem.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
The old man didn't solve it.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Then you solve it.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
After you design a algorithm.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
From a theoretical point of view.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Make sure he's not too bad.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
And then use a numerical experiment to say that he's actually pretty good.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
It's probably like this.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Okay, so to sum up.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
Oh, sorry.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Hey.

51:01.000 --> 51:13.000
Oh, the speaker said his computer was out of power.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Let's wait for him now.

52:01.000 --> 52:26.000
Let's take this time to think about any questions you have.

52:26.000 --> 52:35.000
Hey, I just had one that I didn't quite understand.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Let me discuss it with you.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
If I'm not mistaken.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
He's generating those random instances.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
Basically, it's completely independent and unrelated.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
And then look at a distribution, right?

52:48.000 --> 52:53.000
But in fact, for example, let's use a drinker.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I can do this this year.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
For example, I generate a solution based on this guideline.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And then I'll do this this year.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
And then see what happens.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
And then adjust the next year's sequence according to this situation.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
And then adjust the next year's sequence.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
So, in fact, every instance should be.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
It's going to be more refined.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Not irrelevant.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Right?

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Oh, you mean those instances.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
Uh, maybe this year's instance and next year's instance.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
There should be some relationship.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
For example, maybe the big ship always has 50% of the time.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
The small ship always has 20% of the time.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Yeah, so you split it this year.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
And then I feel like this.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Hey, let's take a look at the fairness of the last one.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
The variance of each merchant ship.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And then use this as an indicator.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
To adjust the next year's sequence.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
It's a bit like your Newton's law.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
The initial guess.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And then refine it to a more.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
A process.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
It's not going to be a bunch of guesses.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
It's irrelevant.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Oh, yeah.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I think this is quite interesting.

53:59.000 --> 54:04.000
You can ask him later.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Maybe his method.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
If it's random.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
His lower bound is not so good.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
But he refined it to the maximum speed.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Much faster than others.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Isn't that amazing?

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
What you mean is.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
If you have some understanding of his instance.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
You know.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
What does the job look like?

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
There should be a better solution.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
Yeah.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
I think this seems to have two questions.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
That is.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
One question is.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
This year's solution.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
And then.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
And then look at the difference.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
How much to adjust.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Is this question going to be refined?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
It's a question in itself.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Oh, expert.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I never thought about it.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Is it going to be refined?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
It's a question in itself.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Because if this question is.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Is a continuous.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Continuous function optimization.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
It's usually refined, but.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Continuous plus smooth.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Some of the conditions will be refined.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
But.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Because his optimization seems to be separated.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Then not continuous.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
So it's hard to say if it will be refined.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Oh.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Hi.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Hi.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
So is there a slide?

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I can't hear him.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
No, he has no sound.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Hello Xiaojie.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Xiaojie is still there.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Can you hear me?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Yes.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
But we can't see you.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Screen.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
And people.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Hello.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Hello.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Hey.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Sorry.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I'm back.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Give me 20 seconds.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Got it.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I'm so sorry.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I just found out.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I forgot to put.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I just forgot to put the pen.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Bring the power line.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
So I changed the computer in a hurry.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Okay, in short.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
We just finished talking like that.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Thank you all.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Clap your hands.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
It's a little funny.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I'll just sum it up.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
In short, as I just said.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Basically, this Fairness research.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
It sounds like it makes sense.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
But in fact.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
There are not many people who have studied.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Most of the research.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Are maximizing.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Overall effect.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
So for this so-called job.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
You love him and hate him.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Or between this agent.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Discuss fairness issues with each other.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
In fact, there is little discussion.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
This question also has a certain discussion value.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
After all, he is NP-hard.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
So the good algorithm.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Or the theoretical value of the algorithm.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
It can also be discussed.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Then we all did these things.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
In fact, it's not very good.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
But it's done anyway.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
It's probably like this.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Okay, thank you all.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Let's thank the speaker again.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
OK.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
There were some questions just now.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Yes.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Let me ask.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Let me ask first.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Oh.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
My question is like this.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
You just said.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Although you can.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
There are some ways you can get.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Upper bound 1.33.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Then the lower bound.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
For example, there are some lower bound.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
If you generate a lot of.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Random instance.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
You can look at a distribution.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Then say this is the lower bound.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
For example.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
This example.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
For example.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I use such a guideline today.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
To distribute.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Then everyone runs like this this year.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
But I can see the results of this year.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
As an index.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
To adjust how to arrange next year.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
and so.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
I actually have a way.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
In this way.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Keep going to a better solution.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Not every year.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
What is the difference between each method?

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
What I just said.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
It sounds like.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
The difference between theoretical research.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Can I hear it like this?

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Can you hear it?

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Thank you.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
That is to say.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
We forgot what we just said.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
In short.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
This is a problem that needs to be solved.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
There are a bunch of ships coming.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Then we have to run.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Then we have to sign them.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
We want to make our goal as good as possible.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Of course you can.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Every year.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Your algorithm will make some adjustments.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
The algorithm must be able to let you adjust.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Then you have some parameters.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
It will do some settings.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
This is OK.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
So what you just said is definitely no problem.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
You can make adjustments according to the change in the environment and the situation.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Then make adjustments.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
In theory.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Let's think about an algorithm.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Its performance guarantee is two things.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
That is.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I'll give you 1,000 ships today.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
100 ships.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
You use any algorithm to line up.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
As long as it's not the best solution.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You don't know how far you are from the best solution.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Because you don't even know how much the best solution is.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Right?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
So you line up.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Some people don't like it.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But in short, you don't know how far you are from the best solution.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
OK.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The theoretical nature of the algorithm.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
What's that?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
He's telling us.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Our algorithm.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
How far can our algorithm be from the best solution?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
How far is it?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
So this is two things.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
In fact, as long as we line up the solution.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Everyone can accept.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Everyone thinks it's OK.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That's just in theory.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Everyone can know further.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
How far are we from the best solution?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
That's about it.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
OK.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Thank you.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Thank you.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Are there any other questions?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Let me ask you a question.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I joined later.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I heard that there is a requirement.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That is to say.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
This algorithm has to be easy to explain.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Is there any specific quantifier?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
What kind of algorithm is easy to explain?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Or what kind of algorithm is not easy to explain?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
The specific quantification.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
As far as I know, there should be no.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Because the explanation is for people to hear.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
The so-called people can not accept this kind of explanation.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I don't have anything.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
People can accept within 15 seconds.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It's called good.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Then it's not good for more than 15 seconds.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
This kind of 15-second quantification.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
That's probably the only thing I can say.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Our algorithm.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
First of all.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Why is it in some cases.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Good performance, bad performance.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
To make sense.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Then why did he give this job to you?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Instead of giving it to him.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
To be able to say.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
The weaknesses of the algorithm.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
That's it.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
So it's still a straightforward.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Explanation method.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
There is no so-called indicator.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Explainable indicator.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Basically, there should be no.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I'll just say it again.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
It sounds like this.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
There may be two.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Indicators in different directions.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
One is.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Uh.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
The algorithm has to explain.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Why is this job given to A?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Not to B.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
This thing itself.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It seems to correspond to.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Uh.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The algorithm itself is weak.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It can't be too complicated.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Maybe there are only two or three lines of weak.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It's called simple.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
This is the first one.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Then the second one.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Uh.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It seems to be more like.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Uh.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Uh.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Or.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I'm not sure if it's the worst case.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
But.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Or how would a certain case be divided?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Then this case.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
To be simple enough.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Then.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Is it true that this algorithm is good or bad?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Is that what it means?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Hey, that's right.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Yes, it is.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Explainable includes.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Uh, you just talked about these different aspects.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Uh, that's why the algorithm does this.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Why in this step.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Give this job to that person.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Uh, this is an explanation.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And then.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Why less work or more work.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Or when the work is tight, the work is loose, etc.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Why in this situation.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Well done.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yes, these two are the so-called explainable range.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
That.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Uh, as I understand it.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
If we are engineers.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
The point of the engineer is to solve the problem.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So as long as the algorithm performs well.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Say again.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So the explanation may not be so important.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
That's like now.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Deep learning.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Those neural networks, etc.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
They're all accurate.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So far, people haven't been able to explain why they're so accurate.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Anyway, let's use it first.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The academic will slowly follow up from the explanatory aspect.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And then, oh, he's really so accurate.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
There must be a reason.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
That's why there's a way to copy it later.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
So everyone will look for.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Explanation.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
So the explanation of this kind of thing is also very important in academia.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So back to the question we just talked about.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Why is our question in.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Actually, it's also very important to explain.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It's just a special case.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It's because.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
The object of our explanation is those.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
The people in the back row.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
They care about fairness.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
A lot of times the care is not to be black box.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So this algorithm is for them.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
They don't quite understand.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So I think it's a black box.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So you have to be able to explain when there's a dispute.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Why is it arranged like this?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
It's probably like this.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But it's also.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
These information methods.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Sometimes when you want to apply it in practice.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
The problem is.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Uh.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Uh.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Can I ask you another question?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Okay.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Uh.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I remember when I was talking about the black box.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Yes.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
There is an example.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Uh.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
If I am the person who designed this algorithm.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Then I might.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I am a black box myself.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Then I will collude with some people.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Then this black box to them.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Especially cool or particularly bad.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Uh.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
No one wants to be particularly bad and collude.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
But.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
But this is the design.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The black box.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Uh.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
This can be explained.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It seems to be another concept.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Because.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Is there a collusion?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Or is there a black box?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Uh.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I think mathematically.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
It seems to be more than this human brain.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Can accept.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Can the human brain accept this in 15 seconds?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
This point can be more.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
This.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
To express in a mathematical way.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Or.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Or check if it meets such conditions.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I haven't thought of a specific way yet.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But I think.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Is there a collusion or is there a black box?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It seems to be easier.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Handled mathematically.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Uh.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
That's pretty good, right?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Yes.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Okay.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I also want to ask a question.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Okay.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Uh.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
You have this algorithm now.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
What I want to ask is.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
When it comes to food.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
For example.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The question of the drinker.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
You may be based on.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Data from the previous year.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You may know this ship.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
This is the proportion of the ship.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
How is it?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Your work.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
What is the proportion of the workload?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
How many big ships and how many small ships?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
That is food.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Will be based on.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Because this is what I mean.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Your instance is not random.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
That is food.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Will be based on such.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Is not random.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
To design algorithms.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Of course.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
That is.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
For example, work to come.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
He must have.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
If Kaohsiung Harbor.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
He came in the middle of the night.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Kaohsiung Harbor must be added.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So most ships.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Will come in during the day.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Then especially at 7 o'clock in the morning.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Will come at 8 o'clock in the morning.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
More than a hundred a day.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Because most of the ships.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
He will be out at 5 or 6 o'clock.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
You will definitely consider your work.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
They are not random.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Consider those patterns.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
You already know that at 7 o'clock in the morning.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
The workload is particularly large.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Logically speaking.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Of course, it is around 7 o'clock.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
There are a lot of people on duty there.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So it is necessary to do the corresponding.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Of course.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Can it be done on food?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Another thing.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
For example, the people of Kaohsiung Harbor.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
They are in turn.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
There are rules for their shifts.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
One person is 24 hours in turn.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Then.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
We also discussed with them.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
There are a lot of people at 7 o'clock in the morning.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
A little more people.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
For some reason.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
But this doesn't seem to be the point.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The point is that what you said is definitely.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Will go to deal with.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
That food algorithm.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Naturally.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
From the one we just talked about.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
A simple algorithm to make some adjustments.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Probably like this.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
OK.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I think everyone should be very easy to understand.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
That is.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
The algorithm of writing paper and the algorithm of food.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Obviously there will be differences.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
When the algorithm is to be discussed in academia.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Must be.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Relatively abstract situation.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Relatively.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Relatively.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Simple algorithm to deal with.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Simple does not mean simple.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Just the situation of food.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
There are two principles.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
There will be 58 exceptions.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So the food algorithm.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Most of the time is to deal with those exceptions.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Then deal with those patterns you can see.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Since there will be a lot of people at this time.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Come in.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
You put a few more people there at this time.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Probably like this.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Yeah, but these things are definitely done.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
It's just that the requirements of food and mathematics.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Will be different.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
You will also run some on food.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Is it simulating?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Will.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Because.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Now we are talking about food.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
It has nothing to do with paper.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
These work hours on food are random.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
You said you want to send someone to the sea.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Bring a boat in.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
The historical data allows you to estimate.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
This is about 68 minutes.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
But in fact it may be 78 minutes.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
It is possible for 52 minutes.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
In fact, it does have distribution.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Distribution will be received.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Who is the queen?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Who is the drinker?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
The size of the ship.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
The impact of eating and stewing.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So it's really time to do.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Food algorithm.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
You must do simulation.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
To be more reasonable.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
To evaluate the good and bad of the algorithm.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
That's right.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
This sounds complicated.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I think so too.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
If you talk about food.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
You can talk about it again.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
There are a lot of strange things.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
For example.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
According to the reason.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
What time should the ship leave the port?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
After the drinker arrived at the scene.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I found out that his ship was still on and off.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
This is also very normal.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Or sometimes the ship will break down.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Then this.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Then the tower has already arranged.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
This ship comes out first.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Then that ship goes in again.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Sometimes someone will be in line.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
So it will be messy later.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
That's right.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
This is also at the airport.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Many times similar problems.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Oh yeah.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Airport.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
That is.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
There are people in the airport.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Then the plane takes off.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So the problem is quite similar.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Then this.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Airport.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
There will be a lot of unexpected things.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Yeah.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Most of the time.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
There will be all kinds of if else.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
If something happens.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
You do this and do that.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
OK.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Does anyone have any questions?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Actually I still have a question.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
But I want to ask at the end.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Because it doesn't matter.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
If there is no question to ask.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Then let's thank Professor Kong first.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Wonderful speech.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Thank you all.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Happy youth.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Let's turn off the video first.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
OK.
