00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, everyone. I'm the host of Taira, Hong Shih-an.

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
We're honored to invite Hong Wei to give a speech.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
Hong Wei is now at North Carolina University.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
He graduated from the Department of Chemistry at the National University of Transportation.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
He entered North Carolina University in 2015.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
He is mainly engaged in the study of light chemistry, energy materials, and nanoparticles.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
He is interested in scientific writing and serves the science communication group in and out of the university.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
The topic of his speech today is Near Field Optical Spectroscopy.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
This is a very popular topic recently.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Let's invite him to give a speech.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Now you can turn on the microphone and give our speaker a round of applause.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Let's start.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Thank you, Jason and Project Taira for giving me this opportunity.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Today, I would like to share the Near Field Optical Spectroscopy.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Sometimes, we also call it NAMI optical nanospectroscopy.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Today, I would like to introduce to you why we do this technology and how it is done.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
NAMI optical nanospectroscopy is an application of NAMI 경찰institute for light.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
For NAMI optical nanospectral?

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
We consider ourselves NAMI optical nanosceptical

02:05.000 --> 02:15.000
We are located at the University of North Carolina,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
at the campus of the church.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Our lab focuses on the development of NAMI optical nanospectral.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
This is our program host, Dr. Joanna Atkin.

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
NAMI optical nanospectral is a heterogeneity.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
The concept is like a chocolate wall.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
If you look far away, you may only see a piece of green.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
But if you look closely, you will find that it is a round chocolate wall.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
And if you look closer, you may find that each shape is different.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Even the angle of each array is different.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
This heterogeneity is often used in research materials.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
We define it as a mesoscale structure.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
This is the structure of the mesoscale structure.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
This is the structure of the mesoscale structure.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
The distribution is about nanometer to micrometer length scales.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Sometimes we deliberately introduce these heterogeneous structures for specific needs.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
But sometimes it is inevitable.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
When you generate molecules or materials, there will be heterogeneous structures.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
This is a sample of a semiconductor with a molecule.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
This is a sample of a semiconductor with a molecule.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
This molecule generates two heterogeneous structures.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
This molecule is a very chaotic structure.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
This molecule is a very chaotic structure.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
And the generation preference of the accelerator called hydrogen acetate is not available.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Most applications use hydrogen acetate for...

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Most applications use hydrogen acetate for...

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Some applications use hydrogen acetate for..

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
