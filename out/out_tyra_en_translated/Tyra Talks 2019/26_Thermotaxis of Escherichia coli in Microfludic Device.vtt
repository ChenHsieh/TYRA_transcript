00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
They can do this.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Bacteria can get energy source.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
So they can do thermotaxis.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
This is the result we just showed.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Bacteria will gather at intermediate temperature.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
But the temperature they like,

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
which is the temperature they reject,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
will change with the temperature gradient.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Will change with the temperature gradient.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
This is our main result.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Of course, we have some control results.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
What is the result of control?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
For example,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
How do we know that bacteria change their preferences

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
because of temperature gradient?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Maybe they change their preferences

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
because of temperature range.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
The range is different from the gradient.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
So we have to make sure

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
that they don't change their preferences

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
because of temperature range.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Then we do the following experiment.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
For example,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
the temperature gradient is originally 59 to 19 degrees.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
We change the temperature range,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
but maintain the same temperature gradient.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
To see if the bacteria are concentrated at a similar temperature.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
How do we do it?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
We put them at 5 degrees.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
From 59 to 19 degrees to 54 to 14 degrees.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
In this way, the temperature gradient is still the same.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
It's all about 40 degrees difference.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
But the average temperature drops.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Right?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Let's see the result.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
The red one represents 31 to 48 degrees.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
The blue one is 26 to 43 degrees.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Their temperature gradient is the same.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
But the temperature range is different.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
We will find that the temperature of the bacteria

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
in the red curve

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
is about 37 degrees.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
37.5 degrees.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
The blue one is 37 degrees.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
36 to 37 degrees.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
So we claim that

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
although they are not completely overlapping,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
their preferences for temperature are similar.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
You will find that

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
there are some systematic differences

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
on the left and right.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Mainly because

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
we surround the wall.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
These parts are close to the wall.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
If they are close to the wall,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
there will be a non-linear force

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
in theory.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
But we don't discuss it here.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
OK.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Finally,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
we have to make sure that

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
although in theory,

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
we have calculated that

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
bacteria need 300 seconds

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
to complete the environment exploration

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
in this size.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
But it's still a theory.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
How do you know it's actually like this?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Right.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
So we did one thing.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Before we take data at the end,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
we take data in the middle first.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
What does it mean to take data in the middle?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
After the bacteria enter the temperature

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
from the beginning,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
it takes about 240 seconds

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
to reach the middle.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
That is to say,

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
let's take a look at

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
the time given to the bacteria

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
in 240 seconds.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Is the specific temperature

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
the same as 360 seconds?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
If it's the same,

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
we claim that

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
at least between 240 to 360 seconds,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
the selection of temperature

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
has been fixed.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
That is, it has reached

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
the equilibrium state.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
This proves that

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
although there is no complete overlap,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
it is qualitatively the same.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
At 240 seconds,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
they like 31, 32 degrees.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
At 360 seconds,

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
they like 31, 32 degrees.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
We choose the steepest temperature

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
for this temperature gradient.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
OK.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
That's about it.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Conclusion.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
In our device,

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
because the people before

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
did a lot of experiments,

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
but those devices

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
may not be well-defined.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
We want to provide

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
a well-defined experiment

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
to make sure

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
or improve

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
the research on thermotaxis.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
We can create

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
a very linear

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
and one drop,

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
that is to say,

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
a gradient from left to right,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
which is a very simple

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
temperature gradient.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
And this temperature gradient

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
is very steep.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
The nutrients we use

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
are bacteria that

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
cannot grow inside.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
That is to say,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
there is no chemo-attractant.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
So there will be less

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
confounding factors.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Then,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
the time we take,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
the bacteria need to reach

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
the equilibrium time

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
is relatively short

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
and reasonable,

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
about 300 to 400 seconds.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Finally,

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
because of the H-filter,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
all the bacteria we take

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
are all mobile bacteria.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Our conclusion is that

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
bacteria can be

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
concentrated in

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
intermediate temperature.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
So it's different from

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
the previous research.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
The previous research found that

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
bacteria will only be concentrated

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
in the hottest place.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
No matter how you increase the temperature,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
it is concentrated in the hottest place.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Because of the relationship

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
between pseudo-thermotaxis.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
But we found that

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
it can actually be concentrated in the middle.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
However,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
what is more surprising is that

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
the temperature they concentrate,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
that is, the temperature they like,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
will change

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
with the temperature gradient.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
OK, that's it.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Thank you.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Now,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
let's see if there are any questions.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Wait a minute.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Let's see if there are any questions.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
OK, do you have any questions

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
for the audience?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Then I have a question here.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Please ask.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I just want to ask

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
why this experiment

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
is done with E. coli,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
instead of other bacteria.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, that's actually

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
the reason.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
In 1976,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
the reason is a bit

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
very simple.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Because in 1976,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
when Maeda did the experiment,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
he used E. coli.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
And then people

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
might just want to learn it,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
so they used E. coli.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Then I personally

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
as far as I know,

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
the other reason is that

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
E. coli

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
moves at the fastest speed.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
So,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
in the same scale

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
and size environment,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
E. coli takes less time

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
to complete thermotaxis.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
So,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
this is probably

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
the main reason for using E. coli.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Because other bacteria

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
move too slowly.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
OK,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
so it's possible that

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
there is research

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
that allows different bacteria

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
to move faster?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I don't think so.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
It's not like that at the moment.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
A lot of people do it.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
For example,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
yeast,

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
which is yeast bacteria,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
or the larger

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
thermotaxis for microorganisms.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Or even C. elegans.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
But in terms of bacteria,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
most people,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I should say all people,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
use E. coli.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Just different types.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Like we use 4, 3, 7.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Some people use different types.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
So, in your field,

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
you can hold a

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
bacteria race

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
to see who can make

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
their own bacteria faster.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
They can't come out

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
because

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
their speed

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
is spread out.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
So,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
they don't run in a straight line.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Right?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
But it depends on

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
who is faster.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Oh,

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
OK.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Got it.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Any other questions?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Yang Bo,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I have a question.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
OK.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Do you think

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
that

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
in your research,

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
what do you think

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
is the hardest

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
or the biggest

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
challenge?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
This is

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
a good question.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
The biggest problem

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I encountered

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
was

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
the source of our nutrients.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
At first,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
the source of our nutrients

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
was something called

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
lactic acid.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
But somehow,

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
the bacteria

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
kept gathering

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
in the hottest place.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
So,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
we kept thinking

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
why.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Then we found out

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
that lactic acid

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
is a nutrient.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
So,

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
although it is a nutrient,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
the bacteria

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
don't like

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
too much lactic acid.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Then,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
we found out

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
that

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
there is

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
thermophoresis.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
That is to say,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
if you put lactic acid

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
in the temperature,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
most of the lactic acid

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
will be concentrated

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
in the lower temperature.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Right.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Then,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
the bacteria

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
will go to the hotter side

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
because they don't like lactic acid.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
So,

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
we spent a long time

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
to change our nutrients.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
We changed it to

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
lactic acid oil.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Because lactic acid oil

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
doesn't seem to

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
attract or

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
exclude bacteria.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
So,

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
it doesn't matter

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
even if there is a drop.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Then,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
the second one is

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
the measurement of temperature drop.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
We used a dye.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
But during the measurement,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
before we know

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
thermophoresis,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
we will find

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
the brightness of the dye.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Because the density of the dye

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
will also change

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
because of temperature drop.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
But we didn't know at the beginning.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
So,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
the whole measurement

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
has been inconsistent with the theory.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Then,

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
when we found out,

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
everything became

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
smoother.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
About these two points.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Right.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Is it OK?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Dr. Yang,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
you mentioned that

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
no one has used this method

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
before.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You mentioned it before.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Maybe I didn't hear it clearly.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yes.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
So,

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
if you are

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
a reviewer

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
and you are asked

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
how to evaluate

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
this method

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
compared to

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
the previous method,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
is it better?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Do you have any index

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
or what kind of measurement?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
We

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
probably

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
don't have any index.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
So,

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
we

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
probably use

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
if it is

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
in such a situation,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
we should say

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
that

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
although our devices are the same,

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
but we use

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
a smaller magnitude.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
It's a very

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
simple step.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
But it's

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
much better

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
than before.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
There is another

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
lucky thing

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
is that the reviewers

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
didn't ask this question.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
So,

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
we don't need

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
to answer.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Yes.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
But if you want to ask,

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
we should say

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
that we have

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
controlled the magnitude well.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Unlike before,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
they used random magnitude.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
So,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
they caused

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
some problems

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
that they couldn't

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
predict.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Yes.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Thank you.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yes.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Are there any other questions?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I have a question.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Please ask.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
So,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
you said that

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
the biggest contribution

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
of your research

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
is to

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
find

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
the

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
right

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
thermal

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
test

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
on

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
the

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
right

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
platform.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Yes.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Before doing

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
this experiment,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
we

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
already

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
guessed

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
that bacteria

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
like 37 degrees.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
We need

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
someone to

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
prove this.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
But somehow,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
there is no way.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
What we see

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
is not like this.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
we feel strange.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Is it because

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Thermotex's mechanism

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
and the

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
thermal test

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
on bacteria

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
are exactly the same

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
as Chemotex's?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
So,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
before the experiment,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
the theory has already

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
analyzed that

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
they should like 37 degrees.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
There are many

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
papers on

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Thermotex's theory.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
But there is no experiment

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
that can prove this.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
So,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
we

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
could have

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
proved this.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
But somehow,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
we created

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
a more complicated problem.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
That is,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
the temperature

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
that bacteria like

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
is related to

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
the temperature.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
But at least,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
we can prove that

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
they do like

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
the temperature

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
but not

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
37 degrees.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
But,

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
we can't prove

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
that they do like

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
37 degrees.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
So,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
we have to

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
go forward.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yes.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I have a question.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Hello.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Hi.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I have a question.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I have a question.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
I have a question.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I have a question.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Okay.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Please ask.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
You said that

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
the temperature

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
that bacteria like

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
is related to

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
the temperature.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yes.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yes.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
So,

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
if we

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
can prove

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
that

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
bacteria like

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
the temperature

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
but not 37 degrees,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
is there a more

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
probable reason?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Actually,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
there is.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Actually,

11:36.000 --> 11:36.900
I have

11:36.900 --> 11:37.900
explained this

11:37.900 --> 11:38.900
to my boss.

11:38.900 --> 11:39.900
But he didn't

11:39.900 --> 11:40.900
want to add

11:40.900 --> 11:41.900
it to the paper.

11:41.900 --> 11:42.900
But I saw

11:42.900 --> 11:43.900
the reviewer

11:43.900 --> 11:44.900
was also asking about it.

11:44.900 --> 11:45.900
So,

11:45.900 --> 11:46.900
there is.

11:46.900 --> 11:47.900
Let me explain

11:47.900 --> 11:48.900
why it happened.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.900
So,

11:49.900 --> 11:50.900
if you still remember

11:50.900 --> 11:51.900
the pseudo-thermal text

11:51.900 --> 11:52.900
mentioned

11:52.900 --> 11:53.900
at the beginning,

11:53.900 --> 11:54.900
that is,

11:54.900 --> 11:55.900
without the ideal

11:55.900 --> 11:56.900
temperature,

11:56.900 --> 11:57.900
the bacteria will move around

11:57.900 --> 11:58.900
and accidentally move

11:58.900 --> 11:59.900
to the hottest place.

11:59.900 --> 12:00.900
Because the temperature

12:00.900 --> 12:01.900
is high,

12:01.900 --> 12:02.900
the bacteria move

12:02.900 --> 12:03.900
slower.

12:03.900 --> 12:04.900
The temperature is low,

12:04.900 --> 12:05.900
the bacteria move

12:05.900 --> 12:06.900
faster.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.900
So,

12:07.900 --> 12:08.900
the bacteria will

12:08.900 --> 12:09.900
gradually move

12:09.900 --> 12:10.900
to the high temperature.

12:10.900 --> 12:11.900
Let's call this

12:11.900 --> 12:12.900
force 1.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.900
This is the first example.

12:13.900 --> 12:14.900
That is,

12:14.900 --> 12:15.900
somehow,

12:15.900 --> 12:16.900
there is an

12:16.900 --> 12:17.900
invisible force

12:17.900 --> 12:18.900
that pushes the bacteria

12:18.900 --> 12:19.900
from low temperature

12:19.900 --> 12:20.900
to high temperature.

12:20.900 --> 12:21.900
At that time,

12:21.900 --> 12:22.900
I claimed that

12:22.900 --> 12:23.900
if there is another

12:23.900 --> 12:24.900
force,

12:24.900 --> 12:25.900
that is,

12:25.900 --> 12:26.900
there is another

12:26.900 --> 12:27.900
force that pushes the bacteria

12:27.900 --> 12:28.900
from high temperature

12:28.900 --> 12:29.900
to low temperature,

12:29.900 --> 12:30.900
right?

12:30.900 --> 12:31.900
I claimed that

12:31.900 --> 12:32.900
this force

12:32.900 --> 12:33.900
will increase

12:33.900 --> 12:34.900
as the temperature

12:34.900 --> 12:35.900
increases.

12:35.900 --> 12:36.900
But the first force

12:36.900 --> 12:37.900
will not increase

12:37.900 --> 12:38.900
because the temperature

12:38.900 --> 12:39.900
increases.

12:39.900 --> 12:40.900
So,

12:40.900 --> 12:41.900
it's a bit like

12:41.900 --> 12:42.900
when you change the

12:42.900 --> 12:43.900
temperature and temperature,

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
it's like these two forces

12:44.900 --> 12:45.900
pulling each other.

12:45.900 --> 12:46.900
When the temperature

12:46.900 --> 12:47.900
and temperature

12:47.900 --> 12:48.900
are small,

12:48.900 --> 12:49.900
the phenomenon

12:49.900 --> 12:50.900
of pseudo-thermal text

12:50.900 --> 12:51.900
still dominates.

12:51.900 --> 12:52.900
Then they will

12:52.900 --> 12:53.900
move to the high temperature.

12:53.900 --> 12:54.900
When the temperature

12:54.900 --> 12:55.900
increases,

12:55.900 --> 12:56.900
the bacteria will

12:56.900 --> 12:57.900
start to move

12:57.900 --> 12:58.900
to the low temperature.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.900
But when we

12:59.900 --> 13:00.900
did the simulation later,

13:00.900 --> 13:01.900
we found that

13:01.900 --> 13:02.900
the distribution

13:02.900 --> 13:03.900
is still different

13:03.900 --> 13:04.900
from what we did

13:04.900 --> 13:05.900
in the experiment.

13:05.900 --> 13:06.900
So,

13:06.900 --> 13:07.900
we didn't put it

13:07.900 --> 13:08.900
on.

13:08.900 --> 13:09.900
But I guess

13:09.900 --> 13:10.900
this is

13:10.900 --> 13:11.900
at least

13:11.900 --> 13:12.900
a part

13:12.900 --> 13:13.900
reason.

13:13.900 --> 13:14.900
Is this

13:14.900 --> 13:15.900
OK?

13:15.900 --> 13:16.900
Yes.

13:16.900 --> 13:17.900
OK.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.900
OK.

13:18.900 --> 13:19.900
OK.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.900
OK.

13:20.900 --> 13:21.900
OK.

13:21.900 --> 13:22.900
OK.

13:22.900 --> 13:23.900
OK.

13:24.900 --> 13:25.900
OK.

13:25.900 --> 13:26.900
Thank you.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.900
Hello.

13:29.900 --> 13:30.900
I have a question.

13:30.900 --> 13:31.900
OK.

13:31.900 --> 13:32.900
Go ahead.

13:32.900 --> 13:33.900
Based on

13:33.900 --> 13:34.900
Dr. Yang's

13:34.900 --> 13:35.900
current research,

13:35.900 --> 13:36.900
what do you think

13:36.900 --> 13:37.900
is the next question

13:37.900 --> 13:38.900
you want to

13:38.900 --> 13:39.900
tackle?

13:40.900 --> 13:41.900
Next question?

13:41.900 --> 13:42.900
In fact,

13:42.900 --> 13:43.900
this device,

13:44.900 --> 13:45.900
let me think about it.

13:45.900 --> 13:46.900
There seemed to be

13:46.900 --> 13:47.900
a lot of people at that time.

13:47.900 --> 13:48.900
In fact,

13:48.900 --> 13:49.900
at present,

13:49.900 --> 13:50.900
we are

13:50.900 --> 13:51.900
at the end of

13:51.900 --> 13:52.900
the stage

13:52.900 --> 13:53.900
of research.

13:53.900 --> 13:54.900
But this is

13:54.900 --> 13:55.900
actually very bad.

13:55.900 --> 13:56.900
Yes.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.900
But if you want to

13:57.900 --> 13:58.900
continue to study in the future,

13:58.900 --> 13:59.900
I think the biggest

13:59.900 --> 14:00.900
key should be

14:00.900 --> 14:01.900
like

14:01.900 --> 14:02.900
the question

14:02.900 --> 14:03.900
that my classmate

14:03.900 --> 14:04.900
just asked.

14:04.900 --> 14:05.900
That is,

14:05.900 --> 14:06.900
why do bacteria

14:06.900 --> 14:07.900
choose different

14:07.900 --> 14:08.900
temperatures

14:08.900 --> 14:09.900
under different

14:09.900 --> 14:10.900
temperature scales?

14:10.900 --> 14:11.900
Is it really

14:11.900 --> 14:12.900
the reason

14:12.900 --> 14:13.900
I just guessed?

14:13.900 --> 14:14.900
Or are there

14:14.900 --> 14:15.900
more different

14:15.900 --> 14:16.900
details?

14:16.900 --> 14:17.900
At this time,

14:17.900 --> 14:18.900
we may not

14:18.900 --> 14:19.900
use this

14:19.900 --> 14:20.900
statistical way

14:20.900 --> 14:21.900
to do experiments.

14:21.900 --> 14:22.900
It is more suitable

14:22.900 --> 14:23.900
for experiments

14:23.900 --> 14:24.900
with single bacteria.

14:24.900 --> 14:25.900
That is to say,

14:25.900 --> 14:26.900
you have to focus

14:26.900 --> 14:27.900
on a bacterium,

14:27.900 --> 14:28.900
give it a temperature scale,

14:28.900 --> 14:29.900
and then you have to

14:29.900 --> 14:30.900
trace it.

14:30.900 --> 14:31.900
It's a bit like

14:31.900 --> 14:32.900
recording.

14:32.900 --> 14:33.900
Look at it

14:33.900 --> 14:34.900
in, for example,

14:34.900 --> 14:35.900
a moving state

14:35.900 --> 14:36.900
within 10 minutes,

14:36.900 --> 14:37.900
and then the

14:37.900 --> 14:38.900
direction of the

14:38.900 --> 14:39.900
hair rotation.

14:39.900 --> 14:40.900
Because we can

14:40.900 --> 14:41.900
use that to

14:41.900 --> 14:42.900
determine

14:42.900 --> 14:43.900
whether it is

14:43.900 --> 14:44.900
swing or

14:44.900 --> 14:45.900
tumble.

14:45.900 --> 14:46.900
So it may be

14:46.900 --> 14:47.900
a single cell

14:47.900 --> 14:48.900
study.

14:48.900 --> 14:49.900
That is,

14:49.900 --> 14:50.900
you focus

14:50.900 --> 14:51.900
on the

14:51.900 --> 14:52.900
temperature scale

14:52.900 --> 14:53.900
and see

14:53.900 --> 14:54.900
how it

14:54.900 --> 14:55.900
decides

14:55.900 --> 14:56.900
the final

14:56.900 --> 14:57.900
temperature

14:57.900 --> 14:58.900
over time.

14:58.900 --> 14:59.900
Is there

14:59.900 --> 15:00.900
any other

15:00.900 --> 15:01.900
questions?

15:01.900 --> 15:02.900
Hi,

15:02.900 --> 15:03.900
can I

15:03.900 --> 15:04.900
ask a

15:04.900 --> 15:05.900
question?

15:05.900 --> 15:06.900
That is,

15:06.900 --> 15:07.900
uh,

15:07.900 --> 15:08.900
hello,

15:08.900 --> 15:09.900
hello,

15:09.900 --> 15:10.900
hi,

15:10.900 --> 15:11.900
that is,

15:11.900 --> 15:12.900
I just

15:12.900 --> 15:13.900
saw

15:13.900 --> 15:14.900
that

15:14.900 --> 15:15.900
you said

15:15.900 --> 15:16.900
that

15:16.900 --> 15:17.900
the

15:17.900 --> 15:18.900
temperature

15:18.900 --> 15:19.900
is

15:19.900 --> 15:20.900
higher

15:20.900 --> 15:21.900
than

15:21.900 --> 15:22.900
the

15:22.900 --> 15:23.900
temperature

15:23.900 --> 15:24.900
.

15:24.900 --> 15:25.900
I

15:25.900 --> 15:26.900
want to

15:26.900 --> 15:27.900
ask

15:27.900 --> 15:28.900
that,

15:28.900 --> 15:29.900
but I

15:29.900 --> 15:30.900
think I

15:30.900 --> 15:31.900
may have

15:31.900 --> 15:32.900
missed

15:32.900 --> 15:33.900
it,

15:33.900 --> 15:34.900
that is,

15:34.900 --> 15:35.900
uh,

15:35.900 --> 15:36.900
you mentioned

15:36.900 --> 15:37.900
that you

15:37.900 --> 15:38.900
use that

15:38.900 --> 15:39.900
container,

15:39.900 --> 15:40.900
it is,

15:40.900 --> 15:41.900
uh,

15:41.900 --> 15:42.900
that buffer

15:42.900 --> 15:43.900
is less

15:43.900 --> 15:44.900
interference

15:44.900 --> 15:45.900
than

15:45.900 --> 15:46.900
the

15:46.900 --> 15:47.900
bridge

15:47.900 --> 15:48.900
medium

15:48.900 --> 15:49.900
,

15:49.900 --> 15:50.900
so

15:50.900 --> 15:51.900
it

15:51.900 --> 15:52.900
is

15:52.900 --> 15:53.900
less

15:53.900 --> 15:54.900
interference

15:54.900 --> 15:55.900
than

15:55.900 --> 15:56.900
the

15:56.900 --> 15:57.900
bridge

15:57.900 --> 15:58.900
medium.

15:58.900 --> 15:59.900
So

15:59.900 --> 16:00.900
I

16:00.900 --> 16:01.900
think

16:01.900 --> 16:02.900
that

16:02.900 --> 16:03.900
the

16:03.900 --> 16:04.900
bridge

16:04.900 --> 16:05.900
medium

16:05.900 --> 16:06.900
is

16:06.900 --> 16:07.900
less

16:07.900 --> 16:08.900
interference

16:08.900 --> 16:09.900
than

16:09.900 --> 16:10.900
the

16:10.900 --> 16:11.900
bridge

16:11.900 --> 16:12.900
medium.

16:12.900 --> 16:13.900
So

16:13.900 --> 16:14.900
I

16:14.900 --> 16:15.900
think

16:15.900 --> 16:16.900
that

16:16.900 --> 16:17.900
the

16:17.900 --> 16:18.900
bridge

16:18.900 --> 16:19.900
medium

16:19.900 --> 16:20.900
is

16:20.900 --> 16:21.900
less

16:21.900 --> 16:22.900
interference

16:22.900 --> 16:23.900
than

16:23.900 --> 16:24.900
the

16:24.900 --> 16:25.900
bridge

16:25.900 --> 16:26.900
medium.

16:26.900 --> 16:27.900
So

16:27.900 --> 16:28.900
I

16:28.900 --> 16:29.900
think

16:29.900 --> 16:30.900
that

16:30.900 --> 16:31.900
the

16:31.900 --> 16:32.900
bridge

16:32.900 --> 16:33.900
medium

16:33.900 --> 16:34.900
is

16:34.900 --> 16:35.900
less

16:35.900 --> 16:36.900
interference

16:36.900 --> 16:37.900
than

16:37.900 --> 16:38.900
the

16:38.900 --> 16:39.900
bridge

16:39.900 --> 16:40.900
medium.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.900
So

16:41.900 --> 16:42.900
I

16:42.900 --> 16:43.900
think

16:43.900 --> 16:44.900
that

16:44.900 --> 16:45.900
the

16:45.900 --> 16:46.900
bridge

16:46.900 --> 16:47.900
medium

16:47.900 --> 16:48.900
is

16:48.900 --> 16:49.900
less

16:49.900 --> 16:50.900
interference

16:50.900 --> 16:51.900
than

16:51.900 --> 16:52.900
the

16:52.900 --> 16:53.900
bridge

16:53.900 --> 16:54.900
medium.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.900
So

16:55.900 --> 16:56.900
I

16:56.900 --> 16:57.900
think

16:57.900 --> 16:58.900
that

16:58.900 --> 16:59.900
the

16:59.900 --> 17:00.900
bridge

17:00.900 --> 17:01.900
medium

17:01.900 --> 17:02.900
is

17:02.900 --> 17:03.900
less

17:03.900 --> 17:04.900
interference

17:04.900 --> 17:05.900
than

17:05.900 --> 17:06.900
the

17:06.900 --> 17:07.900
bridge

17:07.900 --> 17:08.900
medium.

17:08.900 --> 17:09.900
So

17:09.900 --> 17:10.900
I

17:10.900 --> 17:11.900
think

17:11.900 --> 17:12.900
that

17:12.900 --> 17:13.900
the

17:13.900 --> 17:14.900
bridge

17:14.900 --> 17:15.900
medium

17:15.900 --> 17:16.900
is

17:16.900 --> 17:17.900
less

17:17.900 --> 17:18.900
interference

17:18.900 --> 17:19.900
than

17:19.900 --> 17:20.900
the

17:20.900 --> 17:21.900
bridge

17:21.900 --> 17:22.900
medium.

17:22.900 --> 17:23.900
So

17:23.900 --> 17:24.900
I

17:24.900 --> 17:25.900
think

17:25.900 --> 17:26.900
that

17:26.900 --> 17:27.900
the

17:27.900 --> 17:28.900
bridge

17:28.900 --> 17:29.900
medium

17:29.900 --> 17:30.900
is

17:30.900 --> 17:31.900
less

17:31.900 --> 17:32.900
interference

17:32.900 --> 17:33.900
than

17:33.900 --> 17:34.900
the

17:34.900 --> 17:35.900
bridge

17:35.900 --> 17:36.900
medium.

17:36.900 --> 17:37.900
So

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
I

17:38.900 --> 17:39.900
think

17:39.900 --> 17:40.900
that

17:40.900 --> 17:41.900
the

17:41.900 --> 17:42.900
bridge

17:42.900 --> 17:43.900
medium

17:43.900 --> 17:44.900
is

17:44.900 --> 17:45.900
less

17:45.900 --> 17:46.900
interference

17:46.900 --> 17:47.900
than

17:47.900 --> 17:48.900
the

17:48.900 --> 17:49.900
bridge

17:49.900 --> 17:50.900

17:50.900 --> 17:51.900
So

17:51.900 --> 17:52.900
I

17:52.900 --> 17:53.900
think

17:53.900 --> 17:54.900

18:04.900 --> 18:05.900
So

18:05.900 --> 18:06.900
I

18:06.900 --> 18:07.900
think

18:07.900 --> 18:08.900

18:22.900 --> 18:23.900
So

18:23.900 --> 18:24.900
I

18:24.900 --> 18:25.900
think

18:25.900 --> 18:26.900

18:30.900 --> 18:30.900


18:30.900 --> 18:30.900


18:30.900 --> 18:31.900

18:36.900 --> 18:37.900
So

18:37.900 --> 18:38.920
I

18:38.920 --> 18:39.920
think

18:39.920 --> 18:40.920

18:50.920 --> 18:51.920
So

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
I

18:52.920 --> 18:53.920
think

19:04.920 --> 19:05.920
So

19:05.920 --> 19:06.920
I

19:06.920 --> 19:07.920
think

19:18.920 --> 19:19.920
So

19:19.920 --> 19:20.920
I

19:20.920 --> 19:21.920

19:32.920 --> 19:33.920
So

19:33.920 --> 19:34.920
I

19:34.920 --> 19:35.920

So

19:47.920 --> 19:48.920
I

So

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
I
