1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You can see it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, I'll start.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You know my name,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
my name is Wang Zhu Yi.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The easier way to remember is

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the sound of Zhu Yi and the chair made by Zhu.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I graduated from

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the University of South California

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
last year

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today, I want to talk about

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
something related to my thesis

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and my current research.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We have a framework

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
called Innovative Design Thinking.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It guides

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
designers

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
on how to design.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Today, I'll focus on

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
conceptual design.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll introduce

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
its background.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Conceptual design

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
has two phases.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One is concept generation,

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the other is concept improvement.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll talk about it.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First,

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll briefly introduce

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
my background.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then, I'll talk about

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
some of the main

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
terms we're talking about

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and what they are.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is how I write

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
in Chinese.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It may look

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
difficult to read.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is Zhu Yi, Wang Zhu Yi.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I graduated

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
from the University of South California

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Previously,

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I studied

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
light design

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
at the University of Taiwan.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
When I was in college,

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I studied

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
electrical engineering.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It may look

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
a bit complicated

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it is

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
related to

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
system integration

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and system design.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What I'm doing now

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
is a post-Ph.D.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
research.

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm working with

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
my co-director,

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Stephen Lu,

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
who is doing

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
post-Ph.D. research

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
at USC.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'd like to thank

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Taiwan and USC

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
for their cooperation.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is one of the

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
funding

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
for my post-Ph.D.

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
fellowship.

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can continue

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
my post-Ph.D. research at USC.

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I also did

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
some administrative work.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The title sounds better.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's about

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
designing product design

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for students

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
maintaining

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
communication and

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
program.

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I also had

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
a chance to teach

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
at USC.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I taught

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
two classes.

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The first class

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
was

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
about

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
product development

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and engineering.

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The second class

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
was about

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
market

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
direction

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
how to

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
design.

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The third class

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
was about

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
conceptual design.

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I didn't teach this class

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
at USC,

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but I'm going to

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
teach this class

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
at USC.

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
today's topic.

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Today's topic is

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
innovative design

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
thinking.

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm going to focus on

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
conceptual design.

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is also

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
my specialty.

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The so-called design framework

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is a framework

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
doesn't tell you

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
how to do it.

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you follow

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
this framework

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to design,

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you can get

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
better results.

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When we

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
talk about the framework,

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we say it's

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
a prescriptive.

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a bit like

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the doctor's prescription.

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's based on your symptoms

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and his experience.

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He thinks this way

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and you can follow

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
this and get better

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
results.

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we say it's

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
a framework,

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
not a prescriptive.

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In this framework,

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it might tell you

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
what you can do

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
at this stage

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and what you can do

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
at that stage.

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In fact,

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
this framework

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
doesn't just

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
focus on

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
conceptual design.

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We don't have

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
a lot of time today.

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My research

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is also

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
focused on

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
conceptual design.

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is what I'm going to talk about today.

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Before we get started,

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I have a joke

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to share with you.

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Every time I

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
start a class,

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I ask the students

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
if there are

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
five birds

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
on a tree

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and a hunter

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
shoots a bullet,

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
how many birds

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
are still on the tree?

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Does anyone

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
want to try to answer?

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They all flew away.

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm the one who

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
asked the question,

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
so I'll tell you

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that there are three birds.

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why are there three birds?

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
these three birds

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
still on the tree?

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In theory,

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
the shot should fly away.

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why are they still on the tree?

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They were shocked.

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Maybe.

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But these three birds

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
are actually smart.

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They are engineers.

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But because they want

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to pursue the optimal path,

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
they are still calculating

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
how to fly

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
so that they won't

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
be shot by the hunter.

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So they are still calculating.

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because they are still calculating,

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
there are still three birds

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
on the tree.

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The second question is

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that there are

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
five birds,

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
three birds on the tree,

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and two birds flew away.

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What happened to them?

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Did they

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
successfully fly away

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
or were they shot to death?

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's raining.

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It makes sense.

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The answer here

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
is that

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
they fell to the ground.

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But why did they

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
fall to the ground?

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They didn't faint.

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Because these two birds

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
are actually managers.

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They know

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that the right decision

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
should be to fly away

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
or be shot by the hunter.

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But because they are managers,

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
they have forgotten

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
how to fly.

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So they fell to the ground.

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is a joke.

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Engineers

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
usually

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
talk about

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
how to calculate

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the optimal path

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and how to

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
do the best.

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is to do

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
this thing well.

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But sometimes

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
we forget that

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
there may be some

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
so-called

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
social reality.

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We may have some

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
time problems

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
or some restrictions.

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We have to make a decision right away.

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
To make a decision right away

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
is like a manager.

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Their responsibility

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is to make the right decision

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and do the right thing.

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But if

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
they didn't

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
make the right balance,

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
there is one without two,

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and there is two without one.

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
At this stage

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
of conceptual design,

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
there may be some

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
things we will be ignored.

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How to

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
do these two things

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
well?

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In conceptual design,

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
we want to

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
discuss and give

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
a prescription.

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is connected to

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
product development.

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In a

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
product development process,

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it is usually

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
like this.

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
From the concept

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to the final release

279
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to the market.

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Product

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is something

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to be sold in the future.

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So we will consider

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the social reality

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and the market.

286
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We will consider

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
global competition

288
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
or some

289
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
demand

290
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and supply.

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
On the other hand,

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there is a downstream part,

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
the so-called

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
reality.

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This part is to consider

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
technology restrictions

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
or the current stage of

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
technology,

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
or how to

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
optimize,

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
how to

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
make this product

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the best part.

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So there is a so-called

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
upstream and downstream balance

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that needs to be considered

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
in the process of product design.

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The upstream part

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
is called

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
do the right thing.

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Conceptual design is

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to consider

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the concept of

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the design

315
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
between the two sides.

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This upstream part

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
is the main part

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
of ISE 545.

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AME 546

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is the new customer

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
conceptual design part.

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The other part

323
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
is to consider

324
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
the design framework

325
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
between the two sides.

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The design framework

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is the middle part

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
of ISE 545.

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The design framework

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
is the middle part

331
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
of ISE 545.

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The design framework

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
is the middle part

334
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of ISE 545.

335
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The design framework

336
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
is the middle part

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
of ISE 545.

338
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So we don't

339
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
want to start

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
from the very top.

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We want to

342
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
be good enough.

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If there is a good

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
on-line design,

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
then the product

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
can be done

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
to reach the optimal

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
product.

349
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So in fact,

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
in the design process,

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
we emphasize that

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
what we want to consider is

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
good enough, not

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
best or ideal.

355
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
there are two sides to consider.

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
On the one hand, it's social reality.

358
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
On the other hand, it's plurality.

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
In other words,

360
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
we want to meet our goals,

361
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
but it has to be

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
operational.

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So this is

364
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
what we will

365
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
consider

366
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
when designing

367
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
products.

368
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
A product design

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
from nothing to something

370
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
goes through

371
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
three main design

372
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
stages.

373
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The first is functional design.

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The second is conceptual design.

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The third is technical design.

376
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Functional design

377
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
is defined from

378
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Cn to Fr,

379
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
which is the customer's needs

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to the functional requirements.

381
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
These are the functional

382
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
requirements.

383
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The functional requirements

384
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
go to the design parameters.

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
To put it simply,

386
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
DP is the concept

387
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
of design.

388
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
In this process,

389
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
there may not be

390
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
some actual numbers,

391
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
actual sizes,

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
or its geometric shape.

393
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It is a conceptual design.

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then there is technical design,

395
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
which is to turn these concepts

396
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
into actual things.

397
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There will be some process variables.

398
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We

399
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
divide these four parts

400
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
into four domains.

401
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
In this process,

402
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Cn to Fr, we call it functional design.

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Fr to DP, we call it conceptual design.

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
DP to PV, we call it

405
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
technical design.

406
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
In this part,

407
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
we mainly focus on

408
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
conceptual design.

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There are two phases.

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The first is concept generation.

411
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The second is concept improvement.

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why do we

413
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
talk about conceptual design?

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why do we do this research?

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We know that

416
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
in the design process,

417
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
it seems that

418
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
there is no need

419
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
for rules.

420
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It seems that

421
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
some creative things

422
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
can be created.

423
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But in the process,

424
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
we found that

425
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
if you just do brainstorming

426
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
or have some ideas,

427
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
what if these things

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
can't be realized?

429
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
In conceptual design,

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
it is in the middle stage.

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You have to find a way

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to meet the needs of customers

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
or to attract

434
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
customers' interest.

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You also have to

436
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
meet the

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
unfulfilled

438
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
demands.

439
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
In downstream,

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
you have to

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
be able to realize

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the concept,

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
not just

444
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
empty thoughts.

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
In terms of profit,

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you have to consider

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the cost.

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
In this aspect,

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
conceptual design

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
is not that easy.

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But it is also

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
an important phase.

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In terms of

454
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
design,

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
it is in the early stage.

456
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Generally speaking,

457
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
most companies

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
don't have

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
a concept

460
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
when they are

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
designing.

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They have to find a way

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to realize it.

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It is a technical design.

465
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But if you consider

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the long-term

467
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
or new things,

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
from nothing

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
to something,

470
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
it is an opportunity.

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
For product development,

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
it is a very important phase.

473
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In terms of

474
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
conceptual design,

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
if it is okay,

476
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
it is a good decision.

477
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you know

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
it is good,

479
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
it can be realized

480
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
in downstream.

481
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It can have

482
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
low complexity

483
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and good results.

484
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But it is not easy

485
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
because it is in the middle.

486
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It has to consider upstream

487
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and downstream.

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
In the process,

489
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
it does not have

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
actual data.

491
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It is not like

492
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you have a prototype

493
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and you can measure

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
on-board testing results.

495
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
How can we

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
make sure

497
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
the concept is okay?

498
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We have to think about

499
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
how to make it

500
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
as ideal and practical

501
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
as possible.

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We know

503
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
conceptual design

504
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
is from FR to DP.

505
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
First,

506
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
how does this FR come from?

507
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This FR is

508
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
from functional design.

509
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But this part

510
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
is not included here.

511
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I will not

512
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
talk about

513
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
how to find this FR.

514
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
However,

515
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the definition of FR

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is very important

517
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
in terms of

518
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
how innovative

519
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the product will be

520
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
in the future.

521
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
In my class,

522
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
we did not

523
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
talk about it

524
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
in conceptual design.

525
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
In this talk,

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I will talk about

527
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the concept of FR.

528
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It is the

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
pre-process

530
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
of conceptual design.

531
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It is a function

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
that we have to define

533
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
what functions

534
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
these concepts

535
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
must meet.

536
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How do these functions

537
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
come from?

538
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
These functions

539
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
come from customer needs.

540
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
These functions

541
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
are defined

542
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
by designers,

543
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
not customers.

544
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
For example,

545
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
customer needs

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
often change.

547
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sometimes,

548
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
we talk about

549
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
observing

550
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the emerging lifestyle.

551
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
In addition,

552
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we talk about

553
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
need and want.

554
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
When the

555
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
functional requirement

556
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
is closer to

557
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
the basic needs,

558
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the market

559
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
is larger,

560
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but the profit

561
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is smaller.

562
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If it is closer

563
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
to the so-called want,

564
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the profit is larger,

565
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but the market

566
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
is smaller.

567
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
In the process of choosing,

568
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
we talk about

569
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
some strategies

570
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
when it comes to

571
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
functional design.

572
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For example,

573
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
we talk about

574
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
triggering need

575
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
into want

576
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
or want into need.

577
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We also talk about

578
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
different features

579
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
such as

580
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
kind of model.

581
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Excitement feature

582
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and time change

583
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
are discussed

584
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
in functional design.

585
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
However,

586
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
this talk

587
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
will not cover

588
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
this topic.

589
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
As I mentioned,

590
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
functional design

591
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is an important

592
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
prelude to innovation

593
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
when defining

594
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
functional requirements.

595
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Many things

596
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
need to be considered

597
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
when designing

598
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
functional requirements.

599
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
For example,

600
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
the phone holder

601
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
is a common

602
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
design,

603
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
but it is not

604
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
a good design.

605
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why?

606
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because

607
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
it is not

608
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
a good design

609
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
in California.

610
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
In California,

611
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
there may be

612
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
some restrictions.

613
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Also,

614
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
California has

615
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
bad sunlight.

616
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If you

617
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
have a phone

618
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
like this,

619
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
you will be told

620
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
that your phone

621
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
must be turned off

622
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
or can't be charged

623
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
because it is too hot.

624
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There is another possibility

625
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
when designing

626
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
functional requirements.

627
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
For example,

628
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
if the sunlight is too strong,

629
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the phone holder

630
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
should be placed

631
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
on the back of the phone.

632
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
However,

633
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
this is not a good design

634
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
because

635
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the driver

636
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
will have to

637
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
look down

638
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
when driving.

639
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Although it solves

640
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A's requirement,

641
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
it does not solve

642
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
B's requirement

643
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
or other problems.

644
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This is the design

645
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
of the phone holder

646
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
at the air outlet.

647
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This is the design

648
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
of the phone holder

649
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
at the air outlet.

650
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is the design

651
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
of the phone holder

652
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
at the air outlet.

653
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This is the design

654
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
of the phone holder

655
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
at the air outlet.

656
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
However,

657
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
there is a problem.

658
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If

659
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the phone holder

660
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
is sold in California,

661
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
if it is sold

662
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
in cold places,

663
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
such as

664
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Michigan or Denver,

665
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
it will snow.

666
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
When it snows,

667
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
the driver

668
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
must turn on the heater.

669
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
However,

670
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
once the heater is turned on,

671
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
there will be a hot wind.

672
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So,

673
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the phone holder

674
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
will be too hot

675
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
when it snows.

676
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So,

677
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the phone holder

678
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
will be too hot

679
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
when it snows.

680
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
When the phone holder

681
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
is sold,

682
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the driver

683
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
must turn off the heater,

684
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and put the phone holder

685
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
in a storage bag.

686
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The driver

687
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
must then

688
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
put the phone holder

689
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
in a storage bag,

690
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
put the phone holder

691
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
in a storage bag,

692
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and turn it off.

693
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
If the driver

694
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
is not turning on the heater,

695
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
the phone holder

696
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
must be turned off.

697
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The driver

698
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
must then

699
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
put the phone holder

700
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
in a storage bag,

701
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
put the phone holder

702
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
in a storage bag,

703
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and turn it off.

704
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
If the driver

705
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
is not turning on the heater,

706
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the phone holder

707
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
must be turned on.

708
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The basic framework

709
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
of the process

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
is to

711
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
organize

712
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
the information

713
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and make

714
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the decision

715
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
after

813
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and making

814
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the decision

815
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
after

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and making

819
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
the decision

820
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
after

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000

and making

824
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the decision

825
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
after

826
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
organizing

827
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the information

828
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and making

829
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the decision

830
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
after

831
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
organizing

832
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
the information

833
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and making

834
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the decision

835
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
after organizing

836
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the information

837
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and making

838
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
the decision

839
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and making

840
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
the decision

841
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
after organizing

842
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
the information

843
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and making

844
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
the decision

845
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
after organizing

846
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the information

847
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and making

848
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the decision

849
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
after organizing

850
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
If it's not in there,

851
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
it's a synthetic proposition.

852
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
For example,

853
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
let's say

854
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
a bicycle

855
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
has two wheels.

856
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
A bicycle has two wheels.

857
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This is an

858
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
analytic proposition.

859
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
The basic definition of a bicycle

860
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
is that it has two wheels.

861
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The basic definition of a bicycle

862
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is that it has two wheels.

863
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This is an

864
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
analytic proposition.

865
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Or let's say

866
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
a single man

867
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
is not married.

868
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
This is also an analytic proposition.

869
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But if we say

870
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
that

871
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
if it's not in there,

872
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
it's a synthetic proposition.

873
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
it's a synthetic proposition.

874
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
For example,

875
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
if you go to school,

876
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
you have to ride a bicycle.

877
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You don't have to ride a bicycle

878
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to go to school,

879
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
but a bicycle is a method.

880
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's not in there.

881
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
This is a

882
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
synthetic proposition.

883
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So,

884
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
through this synthetic

885
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and analytic proposition,

886
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
we can change the interaction

887
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and create the idea.

888
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So,

889
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
the basic process

890
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
is that we need to do

891
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
a specified action

892
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and then do an idea.

893
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Then we integrate

894
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
the concept of the product.

895
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Then we do

896
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
a validated action

897
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and then we do

898
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
a validated action

899
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
to form the concept formation.

900
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
This is the basic

901
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
part of the concept formation.

902
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You have to follow

903
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
these four steps

904
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to create a cycle.

905
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Then you can go from

906
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
FR to DP.

907
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
For example,

908
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
our FR function

909
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
is to fly.

910
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The specified action

911
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is to fly.

912
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The specified action

913
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
is to lift.

914
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The specified action

915
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
is to lift.

916
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The specified action

917
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
is to lift.

918
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There are some ways

919
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
to lift.

920
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
After the idea,

921
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
we use wings.

922
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
If you have wings,

923
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
you can lift it up

924
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and then

925
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
we can create

926
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
a concept.

927
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It may be an airplane

928
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
because the airplane

929
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
has wings.

930
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It may be

931
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
a final concept

932
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
that can

933
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
satisfy

934
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
the fly action.

935
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Because of this,

936
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
we can have a lot of solutions.

937
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
For example,

938
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we can say

939
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
to fly, not to lift.

940
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
To lift, we can

941
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
use hot air to lift it up.

942
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So we may have

943
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
hot air balloons

944
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
to make hot air balloons

945
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
to satisfy the fly action.

946
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
There are

947
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
different solutions

948
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
such as rockets.

949
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
If it is

950
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
wings and then

951
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
to lift,

952
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
it may not satisfy

953
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
the logic.

954
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The concept is not feasible

955
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
if wings are not a part

956
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
of the balloon.

957
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If wings are not a part

958
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
of the balloon.

959
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
There are several

960
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
solutions

961
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
only by the cycle.

962
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
There are several solutions

963
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
only by the cycle.

964
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
There are several solutions

965
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
only by the cycle.

966
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
There are several solutions

967
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
only by the cycle.

968
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
There are several solutions

969
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
only by the cycle.

970
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Wings are just a part

971
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
of the airplane.

972
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
We can imagine

973
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
that a wing is not

974
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
a complete plane.

975
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So, how do we get

976
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
to this point?

977
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
How do hot air

978
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
get to there?

979
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You need to organize

980
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
the idea

981
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
so that you can

982
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
have a complete

983
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
plan and concept.

984
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Then,

985
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
when you realize it,

986
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
it will be more

987
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
visible.

988
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
it will be more visible.

989
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So,

990
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
we need to

991
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
use

992
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the so-called hierarchy

993
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
to organize the idea.

994
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
to organize the idea.

995
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We need to specify it.

996
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We need to specify it.

997
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We need to decompose it.

998
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
We need to decompose it.

999
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
We need to decompose it.

1000
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
We need to decompose it.

1001
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So,

1002
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the how-what

1003
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
will be

1004
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
different parts.

1005
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The different functions

1006
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
will be more detailed.

1007
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Then,

1008
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
after the idea

1009
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
is created,

1010
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
we will

1011
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
combine it

1012
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
with

1013
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the composition

1014
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
to get

1015
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
a concept.

1016
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So, we can

1017
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
top-down it,

1018
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
bottom-up it,

1019
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and complete it.

1020
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
This concept

1021
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
is not just a concept.

1022
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It follows

1023
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
the logic.

1024
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So, you can know

1025
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the details.

1026
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
What does this concept

1027
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
contain?

1028
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
What is the relationship

1029
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
between these things?

1030
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
For example,

1031
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
this is because it meets

1032
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
this condition, this function.

1033
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
This is because it meets

1034
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
this function.

1035
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Because we have this

1036
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
so-called cycle,

1037
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
specify idea,

1038
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
integrate,

1039
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and then,

1040
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
finally,

1041
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
we have a concept.

1042
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But, we need to validate

1043
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
this concept

1044
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
to be sure

1045
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that this thing

1046
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
can achieve this function.

1047
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Also,

1048
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
we use

1049
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
only some concepts

1050
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
in this part.

1051
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We don't have data.

1052
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So, how can we

1053
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
make the next step

1054
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
to achieve

1055
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
this concept?

1056
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
We use

1057
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
this dual hierarchical structure

1058
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
to make

1059
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
this

1060
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
concept.

1061
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So,

1062
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
the first step is

1063
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to decompose

1064
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
this function

1065
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
into

1066
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
some small

1067
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
paper systems

1068
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
with different

1069
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
paper functions.

1070
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Then, we find a solution

1071
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
for each function.

1072
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Then, we integrate

1073
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
these two concepts

1074
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
to have a complete concept.

1075
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Then,

1076
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
we verify

1077
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
that this paper system

1078
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
meets

1079
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
our main function needs.

1080
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Then,

1081
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
this paper system

1082
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
may have some

1083
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
actual limitations

1084
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
or so-called

1085
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
external limitations

1086
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and external conditions.

1087
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So,

1088
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
when we decompose

1089
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
this function,

1090
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
we won't have

1091
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
this paper system.

1092
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Then,

1093
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
we can move on

1094
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to the next step

1095
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and make it more

1096
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
geometric.

1097
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
This paper system

1098
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
is based on

1099
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the concept

1100
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
we have already

1101
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
developed.

1102
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
For example,

1103
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
if we want to

1104
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
design something

1105
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
that can be

1106
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
transported,

1107
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
we may want

1108
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
to have

1109
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
a support

1110
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and a

1111
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
thing that

1112
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
can be moved

1113
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
to support

1114
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and to move.

1115
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Then,

1116
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
if we want to

1117
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
design something

1118
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that can be

1119
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
transported,

1120
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
we may want

1121
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
to have

1122
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
a support

1123
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and a thing

1124
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
that can be

1125
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
moved.

1126
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Then,

1127
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
if we want to

1128
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000

1129
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that can be

1130
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
transported,

1131
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we may want

1132
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
to have

1133
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
a support

1134
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and a thing

1135
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that can be

moved.

1137
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Then,

1138
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
if we want to

1148
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Then,

that can be

1813
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
moved.

1814
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Then,

1815
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
if we want to

1816
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
design something

1817
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
that can be

1818
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
transported,

1819
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
we may want

1820
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
to have

1821
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
a support

1822
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and a thing

1823
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
that can be

1824
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
moved.

1825
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Then,

1826
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
if we want to

1827
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
design something

1828
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
that can be

1829
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
transported,

1830
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
we may want

1831
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
to have

1832
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
a support

1833
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and a thing

1834
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
that can be

1835
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
moved.

1836
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Then,

1837
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
if we want to

1838
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
design something

1839
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
that can be

1840
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
transported,

1841
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
we may want

1842
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
to have

1843
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
a support

1844
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
and a thing

1845
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
that can be

1846
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
moved.

1847
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Then,

1848
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
if we want to

1849
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
design something

1850
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
that can be

1851
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
transported,

1852
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
we may want

1853
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
to have

1854
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
a support

1855
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
and a thing

1856
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
that can be

1857
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
moved.

1858
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Then,

1859
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
if we want to

1860
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
design something

1861
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
that can be

1862
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
transported,

1863
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
we may want

1864
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
to have

1865
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
a support

1866
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
and a thing

1867
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
that can be

1868
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
moved.

1869
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Then,

1870
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
if we want to

1871
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
design something

1872
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
that can be

1873
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
transported,

1874
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
we may want

1875
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
to have a support

1876
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
and a thing

1877
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
that can be

1878
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
moved.

1879
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Then,

1880
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
if we want to

1881
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
design something

1882
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
that can be

1883
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
transported,

1884
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
we may want

1885
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
to have

1886
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
a support

1887
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
and a thing

1888
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that can be

1889
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
moved.

1890
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Recently,

1891
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
we have been doing

1892
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
a new material development.

1893
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Recently,

1894
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
no one has done this

1895
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
before,

1896
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
but we have to

1897
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
be responsible to our shareholders,

1898
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
investors.

1899
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I think we may have some difficulties

1900
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
when discussing these things.

1901
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
How can we use

1902
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
conceptual design

1903
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
to convince investors

1904
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
that we have reached a certain stage?

1905
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
How can we use

1906
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
this concept

1907
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
to present a better vision

1908
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
or show them

1909
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
where the money is coming from?

1910
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
After all, investors value

1911
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
whether we can make money.

1912
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I understand.

1913
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Your question is

1914
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
that you have a product,

1915
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
but you want to

1916
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
talk to investors

1917
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
about how to make

1918
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
investors accept

1919
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and invest in this project.

1920
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Yes.

1921
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
This is my idea.

1922
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Conceptual design

1923
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
is a place

1924
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
where concepts

1925
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
are generated and implemented.

1926
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You may want to

1927
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
talk about

1928
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
how this thing

1929
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
can be

1930
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
implemented.

1931
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
In terms of investors,

1932
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
conceptual design

1933
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
is more market-oriented.

1934
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
As I said before,

1935
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
we may have

1936
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
two pieces.

1937
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
One is upstream,

1938
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
the market part.

1939
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The other is downstream.

1940
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
The upstream part

1941
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
is the market part.

1942
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The downstream part

1943
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
is the technology part.

1944
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Conceptual design

1945
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
is in the middle.

1946
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You can consider

1947
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
whether the product

1948
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
meets the market demand.

1949
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Whether the so-called

1950
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
functions

1951
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
can make

1952
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
consumers

1953
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
want to buy

1954
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
or whether

1955
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
the market demand

1956
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
already exists.

1957
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
This can convince

1958
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
investors to look at this part.

1959
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Because what they look at

1960
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
is the upstream part.

1961
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The downstream part

1962
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
is what you

1963
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
develop

1964
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and do.

1965
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
There may be some

1966
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
practical difficulties.

1967
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Investors

1968
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
don't care

1969
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
about the specifications

1970
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
of the product.

1971
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
What they care about

1972
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
is whether

1973
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
the product can make money.

1974
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So,

1975
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
we will consider

1976
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
the concept part

1977
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
which is more

1978
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
market-oriented.

1979
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
The function part

1980
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
is more

1981
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
market-oriented.

1982
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So,

1983
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
you can consider

1984
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
whether the product

1985
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
has innovation

1986
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and market demand.

1987
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Whether

1988
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
it has enough

1989
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
competitors

1990
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
or

1991
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
market analysis.

1992
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It's like

1993
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
what I talked about

1994
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
in ISE.

1995
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It's about

1996
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
functional design.

1997
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
How to go from

1998
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
functional design to

1999
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
functional requirement.

2000
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I can't cover this part today.

2001
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
But you can

2002
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
talk about

2003
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
some

2004
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
main concepts

2005
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
like

2006
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
whether

2007
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
your product

2008
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
focuses on need

2009
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
or want.

2010
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Demand may be

2011
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
need or want.

2012
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But the profit

2013
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
must be small.

2014
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
If your product

2015
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
meets the need

2016
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
function,

2017
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
your market

2018
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
will be big.

2019
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
But you must make

2020
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
your product cheaper.

2021
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Then your profit

2022
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
will be relatively small.

2023
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
When we talk about

2024
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
innovation,

2025
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
we don't recommend

2026
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
the product

2027
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
meets the need

2028
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
function.

2029
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
People will want to

2030
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
buy it.

2031
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Although

2032
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
you are a new

2033
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
founder or a new company,

2034
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
your market

2035
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
or market

2036
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
is not high enough.

2037
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
You may not have

2038
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
enough

2039
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
basic demand

2040
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
but you can stimulate

2041
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
people to buy it.

2042
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Your profit

2043
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
can cover

2044
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
the production cost

2045
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
of two or three products.

2046
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Then you can

2047
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
convince your investors

2048
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
to invest in this product.

2049
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
In addition,

2050
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
we have the so-called

2051
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Canon Model.

2052
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
You can see

2053
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
that

2054
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
it has some functions.

2055
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It has basic features,

2056
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
performance features,

2057
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and excitement features.

2058
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
In other words,

2059
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
if we

2060
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
want to

2061
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
sell a smartphone

2062
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
in this market,

2063
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
we have to have

2064
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
a camera function.

2065
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It must be able to

2066
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
download an app

2067
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
or have many functions.

2068
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This has become a basic feature.

2069
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Its performance

2070
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
feature may be that the

2071
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
resolution of my camera

2072
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
is better or

2073
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
the speed of my CPU

2074
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
is faster.

2075
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
The excitement feature

2076
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
is a bit like

2077
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
when they promote

2078
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
their products

2079
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
to their investors

2080
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
or consumers,

2081
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
they talk about

2082
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
what's different

2083
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and what's special.

2084
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
For example,

2085
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
when they launch

2086
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
the iPhone X,

2087
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
they will talk about

2088
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
facial recognition

2089
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and so on.

2090
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
They must have

2091
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
something that can

2092
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
stimulate consumers

2093
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
to buy.

2094
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
This is something

2095
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
you can consider

2096
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
when talking about

2097
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
regional issues.

2098
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
For example,

2099
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
in California,

2100
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
this kind of thing

2101
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
may not be sold.

2102
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
However,

2103
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
this kind of thing

2104
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
may not be sold

2105
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
in other states.

2106
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
You can talk to

2107
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
your investors about

2108
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
these ideas.

2109
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
For example,

2110
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
if you go to India

2111
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
or South Korea,

2112
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
their direction is to

2113
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
launch the iPhone X.

2114
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
This is different

2115
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
in different countries.

2116
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
You need to know

2117
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
where your target market is

2118
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and where your stakeholders

2119
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
are.

2120
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
You can talk to them

2121
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
about this.

2122
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
However,

2123
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
this is a bit different

2124
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
in terms of

2125
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
conceptual design.

2126
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
This concept is not

2127
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
enough for you to realize

2128
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
in the next phase.

2129
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
However, it meets the needs

2130
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
of the previous phase.

2131
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I hope I answered your question.

2132
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I think it's good.

2133
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I'm sorry.

2134
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It sounds like B2C.

2135
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I have a few more questions.

2136
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

2137
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Can you talk about this later?

2138
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I have a NDA,

2139
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
so I may not be able

2140
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
to answer these questions.

2141
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I have a few more questions.

2142
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Is B2C and B2B

2143
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
both practical

2144
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
in terms of

2145
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
conceptual design?

2146
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Or is there a difference

2147
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
between them?

2148
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
In terms of conceptual design,

2149
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
B2C and B2B

2150
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
are one part

2151
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
of the design.

2152
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
B2C and B2B

2153
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
are one part

2154
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
of the design.

2155
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
When you design a product,

2156
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
you can't just

2157
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
consider

2158
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
one part of it.

2159
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Your concept

2160
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
should be

2161
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
whether or not

2162
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
the product

2163
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
can meet

2164
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
the customer's needs.

2165
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
In terms of conceptual design,

2166
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
it can be

2167
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
B2B

2168
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
or B2C,

2169
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
but it's not

2170
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
something

2171
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
you have to

2172
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
talk to

2173
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
your investor about.

2174
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The design

2175
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
is not

2176
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
a functional design.

2177
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It's a design

2178
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
that you have

2179
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
decided

2180
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
the customer's needs.

2181
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
You've seen

2182
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
the demand,

2183
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
so you have to

2184
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
make it happen.

2185
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But if you want to

2186
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
make it happen,

2187
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
you can't just

2188
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
decide

2189
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
one part.

2190
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
If you want to

2191
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
develop

2192
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
your products,

2193
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
there should

2194
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
be actions

2195
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
that are

2196
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
recommended

2197
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
for your customers.

2198
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
For example,

2199
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
there should be

2200
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
a reflection

2201
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
to improve

2202
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
existing products.

2203
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
This is the part of

2204
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
conceptual design.

2205
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
If there is

2206
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
something that is not convenient to publicize,

2207
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
this is my email.

2208
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
You can email me.

2209
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Can you see it?

2210
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I don't seem to have it.

2211
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Stay there.

2212
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Stay there.

2213
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
There is a

2214
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
dialogue box.

2215
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I see it.

2216
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Hello,

2217
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
loyal listeners.

2218
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Zhu Yi left

2219
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
her email in the dialogue box.

2220
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
If you need to contact her,

2221
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
you can use this email to contact her.

2222
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
At present,

2223
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
we want to

2224
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
be open

2225
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and experimental.

2226
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
For example,

2227
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
we can have a discussion

2228
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
with the speaker

2229
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
on the content of the speech.

2230
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
We will

2231
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
post it on Facebook

2232
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
and

2233
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
share it

2234
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
in detail

2235
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
to everyone.

2236
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
We are still experimenting

2237
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
and not sure

2238
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
how to do it.

2239
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
As you know,

2240
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
it is almost completely

2241
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
public on Facebook.

2242
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Some things

2243
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
can be discussed

2244
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
privately

2245
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
with the speaker

2246
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and the interviewee.

2247
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
If you are interested,

2248
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
you can add me on Facebook.

2249
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
My Facebook name is

2250
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
the same as my name,

2251
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Zhu Yi Wang.

2252
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
If you are interested, you can add me.

2253
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Okay.

2254
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Thank you.

2255
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Are there any questions?

2256
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Zhu Yi,

2257
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
it's your turn.

2258
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Okay, thank you.

2259
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I want to vote.

2260
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I think

2261
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Zhou Ren should

2262
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
introduce himself.

2263
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Why should I introduce myself?

2264
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm just a useless person

2265
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
who stays in Japan.

2266
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
No, no.

2267
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Zhou Ren is very good at studying.

2268
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
He is studying at the University of Northeast China.

2269
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We often

2270
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
have a chat.

2271
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I'm glad that it's you.

2272
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Their products

2273
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
are slowly

2274
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
being commercialized.

2275
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
At least they are

2276
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
on the track of practical use.

2277
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It's not like our products

2278
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
are always

2279
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
in theory and

2280
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
hypothesis.

2281
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
It's important to make money.

2282
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I think

2283
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
most people can understand

2284
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
what we are doing.

2285
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It's a process

2286
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
for R&D.

2287
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
For example,

2288
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
let's say we are sure

2289
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
this product is good.

2290
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It's not only neat, but also want.

2291
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
How should we tell them?

2292
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Because manufacturers

2293
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
want a clean product.

2294
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I saw the previous slide.

2295
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I feel like

2296
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
if I tell them

2297
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
how to develop

2298
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
or what design concept

2299
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I think

2300
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
it's a good way

2301
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
to convince

2302
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
investors.

2303
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Tell them how far we have come.

2304
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
After all, we are R&D people.

2305
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Yes.

2306
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Yes.

2307
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I think so.

2308
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
We can talk more.

2309
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
If you

2310
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
think about investment,

2311
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
it's about functional design.

2312
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I didn't cover it today.

2313
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
But this part

2314
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I can share with you.

2315
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It might be useful.

2316
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yes.

2317
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Thank you.

2318
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Thank you.

2319
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Thank you.

2320
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
You're welcome.

2321
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Any questions?

2322
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
If not,

2323
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
let's

2324
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
give

2325
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
a round of applause

2326
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
for Zhu Yi

2327
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
to turn on

2328
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
the microphone.

2329
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Thank you.

2330
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Thank you.

2331
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Thank you.

2332
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Thank you.

2333
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Thank you.

2334
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Thank you.

2335
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Thank you.

2336
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Thank you.

2337
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
That's about it for today.

2338
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Some places

2339
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
in the city

2340
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
are getting close to bedtime.

2341
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yes.

2342
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
That's about it for today.

2343
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
The recording

2344
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
will be posted

2345
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
on Facebook

2346
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
in three to five days.

2347
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
No, no.

2348
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It will be posted

2349
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
on Project Terra's

2350
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
presentation link.

2351
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
If you want to review it,

2352
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
you can go back and watch it.

2353
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Okay.

2354
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Thank you, Zhu Yi.

2355
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Thank you, Ted.
