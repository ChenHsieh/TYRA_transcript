00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TaroTalk.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Today, we have Dr. Su Gongyi with us.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
This is the first time I've called him that.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
He's going to talk to us about his research in Caltech.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Today's topic is Cosmic Rays or Turbulence Can Suppress Cooling Flow

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Where Thermal Heating, Momentum Injection, or Non-HGN Solutions Fail.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Let's get started.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello, everyone.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm going to talk about Cosmic Rays or Turbulence Can Suppress Cooling Flow.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
This is my research in Caltech.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
This is my co-author.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll start with the cooling flow problem.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
In a large galaxy or galaxy cluster,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
we usually observe very strong X-ray luminosity.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
This means there's a lot of gas emitting a lot of energy.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
This means there's a lot of gas emitting a lot of energy.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
So a lot of gas is getting colder.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
So we should expect to find a lot of cold gas in the middle of the galaxy.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
But in fact, we can't find that much cold gas.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
So where does that gas go?

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
The gas may be getting colder and colder.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
And then there's a lot of stars.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
There's a lot of star formation.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
But on the other hand, we find that

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
these big galaxies or galaxy clusters

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
have very low star formation rates.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
They're basically all been crunched.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
So this tells us

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
that there must be something

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
that generates heat

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
to re-heat these gases.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Otherwise, based on so many

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
inferred cooling flow rates,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
we can't consistently find

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
so little cold gas or stars.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
So this is the problem.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
We've observed so much cold gas,

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
but we can't find the same amount of cold gas.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
So this tells us that there must be something

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
that can re-heat the gas.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
In the simulation,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
this problem is called the cooling flow problem.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
In the simulation, the cooling flow problem

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
is most likely to generate too much star formation.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
If you don't have any other mechanism

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
to suppress cooling flow,

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
the gases will keep cooling down

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
and accrete into the center of the galaxy

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
and generate too much star formation.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
So you can see that this is a galaxy

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
with 14 times the solar mass

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
and has a cooling flow problem.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
You can see that in Redshift-0,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
the star formation rate is probably

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
more than 2 times the observed magnitude.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Can you hear me? Hello?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
The cooling flow problem is typical.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
As I said earlier,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
it occurs in relatively heavy galaxies.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
So you can see that this plot is stellar mass

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
versus halo mass.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Halo mass is the mass of dark matter.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
The horizontal axis is the mass of stars in the galaxy.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
If you assume that all the baryons,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
all the gases and all the substances

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
follow the dark matter,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
the flow follows the dark matter

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
and all of them become stars,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
then you can predict the virtual line.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You can see that

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
after a very high-quality galaxy,

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
the green lines below are observed.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
You can see that

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
in a large-scale galaxy,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
there will be a very large deviation.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
The larger the deviation, the more obvious it is.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
This is where the cooling flow problem begins.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Usually, the scale occurs in L-star galaxies,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
which is probably above the Milky Way-sized galaxy.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
The cooling flow problem will become more and more serious.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
In the literature,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
there are some ideas that everyone proposes,

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
which can possibly suppress the cooling flow

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and solve the cooling flow problem.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
These proposals include

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Stata Feedback,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Fully Microphysics,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Cosmic Ray,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
which is the cosmic ray from the supernova,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
which is the cosmic ray from the supernova,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
or Morphological Quenching,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
or AGM Feedback.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
AGM Feedback is the feedback

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
generated by the supermassive black hole

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
in the middle of the galaxy.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
To be more specific,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Stata Feedback,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
which is more likely to be related to the cooling flow problem,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
is Type Ionized Supernova, or AGB Wings.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
AGB Wings is a Stata Wing,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
which is the continuous energy generated by the galaxy.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
It will heat up or provide momentum to the surrounding gas.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Type Ionized Supernova,

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
which is the supernova explosion of older stars,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
is usually Type Ionized Supernova.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
We care more about AGB Wings

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
or Type Ionized Supernova

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
because these galaxies,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
as I just said,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
these massive galaxies are usually quenched,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
so their star formation rate is very low.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
So very few stars are just produced.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Most of the stars are very old stars.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
These older stars,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
their Stata Wings are usually AGB Wings.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Type Ionized Supernova is usually Type Ionized Supernova.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
These things can provide energy to the surrounding gas,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
and either kick them to a place

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
that is farther away from the center of the galaxy,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
or re-heat them.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Another possibility is Fluid Microphysics.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
This includes magnetic field, conduction,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
especially magnetic field and conduction.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Magnetic field can provide additional energy

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
and provide additional pressure

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
to suppress the cooling flow.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
This is another possibility.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Indeed, in some parts of the galaxy,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
we can see that the magnetic field's energy density

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
is similar to the thermal energy density

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
in Equipartition.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
So the magnetic field is very important.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Another possibility is Conduction.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
If the conduction is very strong,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
usually the picture looks like this.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
When gas starts to move from the universe

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
to a place where the potential of the galaxy is affected,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
it will be shocked to a higher temperature.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
So the higher the quality of the star,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
the higher the temperature will be.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
So if the conduction is very strong,

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
it can transfer the heat from the hot part

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
to the cold part in the middle,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
and then re-heat the gas that has been cooled to the middle.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
So conduction is also a proposed idea in the literature.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
It is possible to solve the cooling flow problem.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
The third one is Cosmic Current Supernova.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Cosmic Current is usually generated by shock.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Because Supernova provides a lot of energy,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
it will shock the gas next to it,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
and then there will be a lot of protons

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
being added at a higher speed.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
What we are talking about here is mainly related to

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
the Cosmic Current Proton of GEV.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Usually 10% of Supernova Energy

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
may be generated in the form of Cosmic Current.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
On the one hand, Cosmic Current can heat the surrounding gas.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
There may be Streaming in the channel.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Streaming is when the Cosmic Current and gas

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
are not completely synchronized,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
it will generate all kinds of instability,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
and then through this instability,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
it will dissipate energy and heat the surrounding gas.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
On the other hand, there is the Hadron Collider.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
That is, the Cosmic Current will collide with the gas,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
and energy will be generated in this respect.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Then there is Pressure Support.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Cosmic Ray also provides extra pressure.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
It can also suppress the cooling flow,

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
preventing the gas from moving in the middle of the star system.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Another proposed idea is Morphological Clutching.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
On the one hand, we observe that

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
when the distribution of stars is relatively round,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
the star formation rate is usually lower,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
and the star formation rate is higher when the distribution is more disc-like.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
But someone also proposed that

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
maybe we just need to change the distribution of the star system,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
so that the gas can be stabilized,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
and then it will not move in the middle of the star system,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
and it can suppress the cooling flow,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
suppress the speed of star formation,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
and then solve this problem.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
The part on the left is non-AGM feedback,

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
which is the mechanism that has nothing to do with the huge black hole in the middle of the star system.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
On the other hand,

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
the most popular idea is AGM feedback.

10:04.000 --> 10:13.000
AGM feedback is the feedback generated by the huge black hole in the middle of the star system to the surrounding gas.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
This picture is like this.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
When the gas continues to accrete into the black hole in the middle,

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
some of the energy will be fed back to the surrounding gas.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
On the one hand, it may provide momentum,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
or gas around the heating,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
or gas around the shock,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and produce a lot of cosmic rays.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
On the other hand, it may also stir those gases,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
and then produce more turbulence,

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
and then it may also suppress the cooling flow.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
In my next talk,

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
I will gradually say why these on the left are not important.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
The feedback on the right is related to AGM feedback,

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
which is the feedback related to the huge black hole in the middle of the star system.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
It may be more important,

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
especially the two aspects of cosmic rays and turbulence.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
This is my next talk outline.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I will first talk about how we set up these simulations.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Then I will talk one by one,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
such as Stata Feedback,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Fluid Microphysics,

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Cosmic Ray,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Morphological Quenching,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
and AGM Feedback.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
I will talk one by one,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
why each one is important or not.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
This is the setup of the simulation.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
We study this problem.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
As I just said,

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
this problem is usually more important in galaxies with a quality higher than L-star galaxy.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
L-star galaxy is probably the Milky Way-sized galaxy.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Its solar mass is about 10 to 12 quadrilaterals.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We have tried three cases,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
10 to 12 quadrilaterals,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
10 to 13 quadrilaterals,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
and 10 to 14 quadrilaterals.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
We use Idealized Isolated Galaxy Simulation.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
We made our own galaxy,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
and then we started from an initial condition.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Then we add different feedback,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
or as I just said,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
those physics go in,

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
and then our initial condition is the initial condition based on observation.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
If you don't have any mechanism to suppress the cooling flow problem,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
the cooling flow problem will occur.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
As shown in the previous picture,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
there will be too much star formation.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So if you let the initial condition evolve,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
it will soon be inconsistent with the observation.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
We use this initial condition,

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
and then we add the static feedback,

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
free microphysics,

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
and AGM feedback.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
We try to see if there is any way to maintain it in the simulation,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
to maintain it in line with the observation.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
The cooling flow will not be too strong,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
and there will not be too many stars.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
In our initial condition,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
we have pre-set,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
and based on the observation,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
we manually set the Dark Matter Halo,

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
the star,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
the Static Disk,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
the Static Bulge,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
and the Gas Disk.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
This is the gas around the star,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
and we have a pressure-supported Hot Halo,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
which is the entire star,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
this huge amount of star,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
there will be a gas Halo covering the entire galaxy,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
the entire galaxy.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Basically, it should be pressure-supported,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
the pressure compensates the gravitational force,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
and it should be a pressure-supported Hot Halo,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
this is our initial condition.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
The picture on the right shows that

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
the axis on the left is X-ray Luminosity,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and the axis on the right is Halo Mass.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
These three black dots are our initial conditions.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
You can see that

13:56.000 --> 14:05.000
the X-ray Luminosity is based on the observed data.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
In our simulation,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
we use Gizmo,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
which has gravity,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
and all kinds of feedback are already in there,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
and there will be a Hydro Code.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
As for the Star Feedback,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
we use the FIRE Star Feedback Model,

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
which is a very good Star Feedback Model.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
It includes Supernova,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Star Winds,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Photonization,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Photoelectric Heating,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
and Radiational Pressure.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
For the cooling of the gas,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
we follow it from 10K to 12-14K,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
so the gas can cool from 12-14K to 10K.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
We use different cooling methods to cool the gas.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
As for the Star Formation,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
when the gas cools and becomes dense,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
it can produce stars.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
We only allow the gas to meet the following conditions.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
The gas must be self-gravitating and molecular,

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
and its density must be greater than 100 particles per cubic centimeter,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
so that it can produce stars.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
As for Cosmic Ray,

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
we model it as an extra fluid,

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
assuming that it is in line with the flow of the Hydro Code,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
and we try to model it as GEV Cosmic Ray.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Cosmic Ray can do some things,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
such as PDP work,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
which means that it will have pressure

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
and will make contact with other gases.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
It will diffuse to the surroundings,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
and it will have a relative movement with the gas,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
which will produce various kinds of stability,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
and will lose some energy,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
and heat up these gases.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Similarly, it will collide with the gas,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and it will heat up those gases,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and it will lose Cosmic Ray energy,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
but it will provide heat energy to the gas.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
First, let's talk about Static Feedback.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Is Static Feedback useful for cooling flow problems?

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
As we said, we have 12 quadrants, 13 quadrants, 14 quadrants,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
and three different runs.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
We usually enable M12, M13, and M14.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
We have two different simulations for M12 and M13.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
The first one is Default Run,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
which has FIRE Static Feedback,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
which also includes Static Feedback.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
The other one is No Feedback Run,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
which has no Static Feedback.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
As we said, in Static Feedback,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
we believe that Type Ionized Supernova

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
and AGB Wink are more important,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
so we added more.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
In addition to Default Run,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
which has Static Feedback and No Feedback Run,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
we also have Type Ionized Supernova Run.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
We only enable Type Ionized Supernova.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Static Feedback has various channels,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
so we only enable Type Ionized Supernova in this run.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
In the other run, we only enable AGB Wink.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
Then we start running from Initial Condition

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
based on the relative situation.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Let's see what the result is.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
This is the result.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
This is the result based on the situation mentioned above.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
The result is the star formation rate,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
which is the speed of the star formation.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
You can see that the biggest difference is the black line.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
The black line is the run with all Static Feedback.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
The red line has no Static Feedback,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
which means there is no Static Feedback at all.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
The difference between the two is mainly in the beginning.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Without Static Feedback,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
the gas stored in the center of the star will cool down very quickly

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
and then explore the center of the star

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
and produce too many stars.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
You can see that there is a very high star formation rate at the beginning.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
After the gas in the middle is gradually used up,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
the remaining star formation is

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
then from the gas at a further distance from the beginning

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
to the cooling flow

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
and then cool down to the center of the gas to produce stars.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
You can see that even though Static Feedback

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
suppressed the star formation rate at the beginning,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
but later, at the end of the simulation,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
you can see that in all the runs,

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
the star formation rate is still very high,

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
from several solar max per year to dozens of solar max per year.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
It can't completely solve the cooling flow problem.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
It still produces too many stars.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
Can you talk about the nominal observational rate you want to get?

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
Generally, a crunched galaxy can be suppressed to 10 to 0,

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
which is less than one solar max per year,

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
especially a 14-dimensional or larger galaxy.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
But dozens of solar max per year is definitely too high.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Okay, go ahead.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
So Static Feedback can't solve the cooling flow problem.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
In all the runs, you can see that

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
at the end of the simulation,

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
the star formation rate of Static Feedback is getting smaller and smaller.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
And no matter what, it still produces more than 10,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
especially in more massive galaxies,

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
which are more than 10 to 14 solar max per year.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
On the other hand, you can see that

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
only the run of Type Ion and Supernova

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
and only the run of AGB Wind,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
which is the red line and the light blue line,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
in the case of 14 dimensions,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
the star formation history,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
the process of star formation,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
is basically the same as without feedback.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
In other words, the contribution of Type Ion, Supernova, and AGB Wind is very small.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Why is that?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
On the other hand,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
we are trying to quantify

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
how many variables,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
which are not documented,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
are in the middle of the galaxy.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
So the first line is quantified,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
which is the Baryonic mass in the middle of the galaxy,

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
and its evolution over time.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
You can see that

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
all the Baryonic mass changes over time

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
in the 30-kpc sphere,

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
in the 30-kpc sphere in the middle of the galaxy.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You can see that it goes up, of course.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
If there is no stellar feedback,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
you can see that the Baryonic mass

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
basically has no change in its evolution.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
There are still so many gas,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
so many baryons,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
floating in the middle of the galaxy,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
which is constantly rising.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Its rate of rise has not changed,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
regardless of whether you have stellar feedback.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
On the other hand,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
we can see that the second line is quantified,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
which is the hot gas,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
which is the hotter gas,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
over all the Baryonic mass.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
What is the ratio?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
You can see that

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
there is no stellar feedback,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
and its hot gas

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
basically has no change.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
The third line is changed.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
The third line is cold gas or Baryonic mass,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
which is the cold gas

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
in the Baryonic mass.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You can see that

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
there is no stellar feedback.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Basically, very little gas

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
is in the cold gas phase.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Its ratio is very low.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
What happens?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
When the gas cools down,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
if there is no stellar feedback,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
it will quickly turn into a star.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Then you will have too many stars.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But this also shows that

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
your stellar feedback

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
basically changes

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
how much cold gas

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
turns into a star,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
but it does not change

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
how much hot gas,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and it does not change

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
the total Baryons

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
in the middle of the galaxy.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
So you didn't solve the cooling flow problem.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
You just changed

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
the ratio between the cold gas

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and the stars.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
You didn't change

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
the Baryons

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
in the middle of the galaxy.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
So you didn't solve the cooling flow problem.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Why is

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
the cooling stellar feedback

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
not efficient?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Here we use

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
the M14 galaxy

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
to explain.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
In the upper left corner,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
we plot the

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
total cooling rate

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
as a function of time.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
In the upper right corner,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
we plot the total energy input,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
which is the energy provided by stellar feedback.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
You can see that

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
all the energy provided by stellar feedback

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
is not enough

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
to compensate for the cooling.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
The stellar feedback

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
is to provide energy

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
to either move the gas farther away,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
or provide the surrounding gas

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
in the form of motion or heat.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
But the gas loses energy

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
with a greater rate,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
and the cooling rate is always higher.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
So in this situation,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
stellar feedback cannot provide

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
enough energy to compensate

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
for the cooling.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So the cooling flow problem will continue to occur.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But if you try to quantify

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
how much energy

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
all kinds of stellar feedback contribute,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
in the lower panel,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
the lower left corner is the energy

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
contributed by Supernova,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
and the lower right corner is the energy

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
contributed by Stellar Wind.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
The first line corresponds to

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
the energy produced by younger stars.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
The second line corresponds to

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
the energy produced by older stars.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
As you can see,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
because stellar feedback

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
does not fundamentally solve

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
the cooling flow problem,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
the star condition is still very high.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
So the most energy

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
in this simulation

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
is still the energy

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
generated by the supernova explosion

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
of younger stars.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
So this is still the maximum energy.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
But even if you have

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
so many young supernova explosions,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
the energy generated

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
is still far less than the cooling rate.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Because

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
the energy generated by

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
those older stars is

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
not only Type Ia Supernova,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
but also AgV Wind.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So it is impossible

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
for Type Ia Supernova

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and AgV Wind

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
to have too much influence

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
on the cooling flow.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
This also explains why

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
we only run Type Ia Supernova

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
and AgV Wind.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
The star condition history

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
is basically the same

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
without any feedback.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I have a question.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Hello?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Hello?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Hello?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I can't hear you.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
What's wrong?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Hello?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Hello?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I can hear you.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
How are you?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Hello?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I just cut off.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Sorry. Can you hear me?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I can hear you.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
There are some spikes on the two curves.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
The spikes are actually very large.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
The spikes on the log scale are bulging like this.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
What is that?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Do you know the other three lines below?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Which spikes are you talking about?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
The two lines

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
in the upper left panel

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
are the default

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and low metallicity.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Default

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
and low metallicity.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So the cooling rate is...

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I'm talking about those

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
small edges.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
It's not that large.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
It's just that

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
there are some fluctuations

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
based on the gas

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
at that time.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
So it's not a special event.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
You think it's just

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
a normal fluctuation.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, I think it's normal.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I didn't look closely.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It's probably the same as my average time scale.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
But yeah, it's probably just...

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Oh, okay.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I thought it was a special event.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And the other three are not.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
No, I think it's okay.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Okay, okay.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Okay, thank you.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Yeah, those two

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
have a complete set of feedback.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Maybe it's just that time.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
The set of feedback is a little stronger.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Or there's some gas

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
that's denser, and the cooling rate is stronger.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I didn't look closely.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
But I think it's okay.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
It's not that big.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Usually, there are some fluctuations at the scene.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
That's another question.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
The set of feedback is another question.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
It may actually provide energy

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
to the Galaxy

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
to reheat the gas.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
But in fact,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
it also produces a lot of metal.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
In astronomy, when we say metal,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
we mean any element

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
greater than helium.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Any element greater than helium.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Because the set of feedback

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
produces a lot of heavier elements.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
These heavier elements

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
can make the cooling rate

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
cooler.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
It makes the gas easier to cool.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
On the left,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
we see two lines.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
One line is the default run.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's a normal run.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
The other line is where we deliberately

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
put its heavier elements

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
in the Galaxy.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
It's very, very low.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You can see if there's any of these metals.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Its star formation rate

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
can actually be quite different.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
So,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
these metals are basically

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
consistently from the set of feedback.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
So, we can say that

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
the set of feedback

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
is basically possible to

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
make the cooling flow problem

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
worse.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Because these heavier elements

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
induce the gas to cool down.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
So, the set of feedback doesn't work.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Let's look at magnetic field conduction

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
in Cosmic Graviton Supernova.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
So,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
let's look at these heavy elements one by one.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
In the case of 10, 12, and 13,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
we have a default run.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It has a fire set of feedback.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
It only has a fire set of feedback.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
It doesn't have any other fully microphysics.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
We also have another all-microphysics run.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
It has a fire set of feedback,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
magnetic field, conduction, and viscosity.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
In the Galaxy of 10, 12, and 14,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
in addition to the default

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and all-microphysics run,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
we have another run,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
which is all-microphysics plus Supernova.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
In addition to the all-microphysics run,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
we have a fire set of feedback,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
magnetic field, conduction,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
and viscosity.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
We also have 10% of Supernova energy

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
in Cosmic Graviton.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I have a question about

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Supernova.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I'm actually very surprised

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
that this is a hypothesis.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Because this can be estimated,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
right?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
If you observe the rate,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
you can estimate the energy budget.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
You can see the luminosity

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
and know the rate.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Can you estimate the energy budget

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
to solve this problem?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Or is it just a qualitative

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
possibility?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
When we were doing this project,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
we basically believed

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
that this was impossible to solve.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Some papers

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
tried to propose

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
that Supernova

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
had enough energy.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Their approach was

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
to compare the total cooling rate

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
in the center of the star

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
with the energy input

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
of the stellar feedback.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
They found that

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
the stellar feedback

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
had enough energy.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But our point is

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
that even in the very,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
very middle part,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
it's possible that it's enough.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
In fact, the gas

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
next to it is very, very large.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
In the outer part,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
the gas will continue to cool

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and go to the center of the star.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
But your star is only

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
in the center of the halo.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
So you should calculate

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
the entire cooling rate

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
of the entire halo,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
not the cooling rate

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
where the star is distributed.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Because you are

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
highly biased to

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
this kind of very, very localized

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
calculation.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Their estimate

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
is that

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
the energy input

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
and cooling rate

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
in the center of the star

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
will continue to cool

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
and go to the center of the star.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
So you should compare

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
the entire cooling gas.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
We think that

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
this is not enough.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And our simulation

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
can't solve this problem.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Okay, you go on.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It depends on how you solve it.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Thank you.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
So here we have

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
magnetic field conduction

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
with viscosity and cosmic ray.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
This is the star

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
we simulated.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Is there any magnetic field?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
The black line

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
has no magnetic field conduction,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
and the blue line

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
has magnetic field conduction.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
In the smaller galaxy,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
there is magnetic field

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
conduction.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You can see that

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
the star condition

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
is a little less,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
but only a little.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
With cosmic ray,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
the star condition

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
is slightly reduced,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
but it is the same.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
As time goes by,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
you can see that

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
in the later time,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
the star condition

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
is basically the same

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
as without cosmic ray.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
If you continue to quantify

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
how much gas

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
is in the middle of the galaxy,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
the bottom line is

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
total baryonic mass as a function of time,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
and the top line is

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
hot gas mass over baryonic mass.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
You can see that

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
with magnetic field conduction,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
it is possible that

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
the total baryonic mass

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
in the middle of the galaxy

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
may be slightly suppressed

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
by magnetic field conduction,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
but it is not

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
the difference between

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
the two.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
There is no way to

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
solve this problem.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
With cosmic ray,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
you can see that

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
the gas in the middle

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
is slightly heated,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
but it is not

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
the difference between

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
baryonic mass and

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
baryonic mass.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Basically,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
you can't solve

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
this problem.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Why can't we solve

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
this problem?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
We have seen the

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
results of the simulator.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
The energy per unit mass

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
is in different energies.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
The red line is thermal energy,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
the blue line is magnetic energy,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
the black line is turbulent energy,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
and the blue line is

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
the energy distribution

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
as a function of radius,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
which is how far

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
the energy distribution

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
is from the center of the galaxy.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
The first line is the energy distribution,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
and the second line is

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
the energy distribution

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
over thermal energy,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
which is how important

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
it is compared to thermal energy.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You can see that

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
in most of the radius,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
the energy distribution

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
is much smaller than

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
thermal energy.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
The energy distribution

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
in the middle

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
is not so different,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
but in the cooling flow

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
area,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
the energy distribution

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
is much smaller

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
than thermal energy.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
This limit

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
can't affect

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
the cooling flow

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
in the cooling area.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Why doesn't conduction

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
affect the cooling flow?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
On the one hand,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
some of the reasons are

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
that conduction

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
is heat transfer

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and it depends on

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the direction of

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
the temperature gradient.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
But basically,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
the particles with heat

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
are all charged particles,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
so they are trapped

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
in the direction of the magnetic field.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
So basically,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
if you want the thermal gradient

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
to be in one direction

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
and the magnetic field

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
to be in the other direction,

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
the direction of the conduction

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
will be projected

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
to the direction of the magnetic field.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
This projection

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
will reduce

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
the effective conductivity.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Let's estimate

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
how much this reduction

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
is.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
The middle part

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
reduces the effective conductivity

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
by at least half,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
and the outer part

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
reduces it by 1 or more thirds.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
So this is one way

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
to explain why

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
the conduction

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
is not very important

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
in our simulation.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Let's talk about

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
the morphological environment.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
For some people,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
the distribution from

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
a disc to a boat

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
is a more elliptical distribution,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
so the gas is stabilized

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
and you don't have

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
too many stars.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
In our simulation,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
we directly change

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
the distribution of stars

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
in the initial condition.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
The black line and the gray line

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
have feedback run,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
and the black line is

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
the normal distribution.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
The gray line is

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
the elliptical distribution.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
We also try

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
the no feedback run,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
which is the red line

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
and the peach red line.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
We also change the distribution

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
of stars.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
You can see that

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
if you slightly change the distribution of stars,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
you can slightly change

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
the initial

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
start of the simulation.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
But at the end of the simulation,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
all the run

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
are saturated

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
to a very high level.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Basically, you just change

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
the distribution of stars

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
without changing the

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
final start of the simulation.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
But why is this

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
not important?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
There is no way to solve this problem.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Basically,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
it depends on whether

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
your gas is stabilized

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
or it will continue to

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
become denser

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
and generate stars.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Basically, we often estimate

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
a rotationally supported gas.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
We estimate its thermal Q.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
This is Scale S.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Omega is its angular velocity,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
and the sigma of the mole

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
is its surface density,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
which is the density of the unit area.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Usually, if this number

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
is less than 1,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
it means that

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
its density is relatively zero.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
If this number is greater than 1,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
it means that

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
it will continue to expand

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and generate more density

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and generate stars.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
If this number is greater than 1,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
it means that

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
it is a relatively stable situation.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
You can see that

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
if you keep changing the distribution

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
of stars,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
if you change the shape

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
of the same quality star

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
slightly,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
the result is that

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
you slightly change its angular velocity.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You can imagine that some stars are

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
distributed in the shape of a circle or a disk.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
The gravitational potential will change slightly,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
but you only slightly change

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
the effect of

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
the order of unity.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
However, your cooling flow

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
provides more gas

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
to the center of the star.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Basically, you can do

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
the surface density,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
which is the density of the unit area.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
If you keep changing the distribution of stars,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
it means that

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
you will change the order of unity,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
because your cooling flow

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
will continue to put more gas

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
into the center of the star.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
So eventually,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
although you can slightly reduce

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
the distribution of stars,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
your cooling flow will

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
make the distribution of stars

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
bigger and bigger.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
So eventually,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
the total Q is always less than 1.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I have a question.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
In these two simulations,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
you only changed the distribution

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
of baryonic stars, right?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Yes, I only changed the distribution

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
of stars.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
So you didn't change

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
the dark matter halo, right?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
No, I didn't change the dark matter.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
But for example,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
the disk galaxy and the circular one,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the reason why they become like this,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
their mechanism...

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
But this is a proposed idea.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
He said that

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the difference in the distribution of stars

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
causes the cooling flow problem.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
But I tell you that

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
although you observe

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
the disk galaxy,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
its star formation rate is higher,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
its bulge galaxy,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
its star formation rate is lower,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
but this correlation

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
is not causal.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
It's not that you just have to change

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
the distribution of stars,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
you can change the star formation.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Oh, okay.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
So logically, I can accept it.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
But this is what I think.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
If the galaxy morphology

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
is different today

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
because its dark matter halo is different,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
if you want to study

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
such a mechanism,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
shouldn't you also change the halo?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Although I don't know what the halo looks like,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
is it possible?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It's possible because of the halo.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Or even because, for example,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
your AGM feedback,

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
the K-dome around you,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
the feedback generated by the surrounding gas

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
caused the change,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
or the merger,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
or the change caused by two stars

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
together.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Now, no matter why

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
the distribution of stars

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
is like this,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
we can't directly solve

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
the distribution of stars,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and we can't change

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
the star formation rate.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
We have to prove that this logic is not true.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I agree with this conclusion.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Okay, thank you.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
If you directly put in

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
some numbers,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
you only need

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
about 3 x 10 to the power of 14 solar mass

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
in the middle of 10 kVc.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
The gas surface density

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
will be high enough

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
to self-shield.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
The surrounding gas will not be affected

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
by other radiation,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and it can cool down to a very low temperature

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
of 10 to the power of 14 kVc.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
If you put these numbers in,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
you can get a much lower temperature

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
of 10 to the power of 14 kVc.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
These numbers are very easy to achieve,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
so eventually your gas

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
will become very dense

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
and continue to flow

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
into the middle of the galaxy

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
without solving any problems.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Okay, so we've talked about

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
all the mechanisms

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
that are not AGM feedback

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
proposed in the literature.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
In this regard, we talked about

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Static Feedback, Magnetic Field Conduction,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Cosmic Reverse Supernova,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
and Nucleophage Quenching.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I believe I just

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
tried to convince everyone that

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
none of them can work.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
They all still have cooling flow problems.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Their gas transformation rates are still too high.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Eventually,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
they are still the same

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and not the same as observations.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
So none of them work.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Next, let's move on to AGM feedback.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
AGM feedback is

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
the feedback of a huge black hole

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
in the middle of the galaxy

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
to the gas around it.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
A complete AGM feedback model

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
should be able to consistently

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
model how much gas

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
runs to the black hole

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
in the middle,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and how much energy

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
is fed to the gas around it.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
But it is very

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
model-dependent.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Instead of

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
jumping directly

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
into a model

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
we believe in,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
we try to do a bigger

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
parameter search.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
We don't care

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
how much gas

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
or stars

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
run to the black hole

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
in the middle of the galaxy.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We only care about

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
the gas around the black hole.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
For example,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
if we add different

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
types of energy

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
to the black hole,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
what will happen to the gas

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
around the black hole?

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Basically,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
we inject energy

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
from the black hole

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
in different forms

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
and intensities

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
to different radii

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
to see if there is

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
a scenario

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
where we can

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
suppress the star formation rate

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
and quench the galaxy.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
If the galaxy is successfully quenched,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
does it mean that

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
the energy produced

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
in the galaxy

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
is equivalent to

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
the energy produced

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
in the black hole?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Is the energy

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
we need

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
in the black hole

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
a reasonable amount

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
of energy

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
to produce

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
four different types

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
of energy

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
in the black hole?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
The first is momentum,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
which can provide

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
a lot of kinetic energy

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
to the gas around the black hole

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and then kick it

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
to a far away place.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
The other form is

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
thermal energy,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
which can heat

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
the gas around the black hole

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
in various ways

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
such as radiational heating.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It can heat the gas

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
around the black hole

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
to a higher temperature.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
The other form is

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
turbulent stirring,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
which can stir the gas

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
around the black hole

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
to produce currents

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
in the black hole.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
It can also

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
make the gas

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
around the black hole

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
more turbulent

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and more difficult to collapse.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
This is another possible form.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
The other form is

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
cosmic ray,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
which can

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
shock the gas

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
around the black hole

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
to produce

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
cosmic rays.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
This is another

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
possible form

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
of energy.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
If it is momentum,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
it can heat

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
the gas around the black hole

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
to a higher temperature.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
There are three possible forms

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
of thermal heating.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
The first one is

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
uniformly heating

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
all the gas

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
in the galaxy.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
The other one is

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
only heating

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
the gas

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
around the black hole

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
to a higher temperature.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
The third one

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
is

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
heating

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
all the gas

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
in the galaxy

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
to a higher temperature.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
The fourth one

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
is

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
heating

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
all the gas

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
around the black hole

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
to a higher temperature.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
The fifth one

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
is

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
heating

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
all the gas

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
around the black hole

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
to a higher temperature.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
The sixth one

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
is

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
heating

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
all the gas

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
around the black hole

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
to a higher temperature.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
The seventh one

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
is

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
heating

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
all the gas

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
around the black hole

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
to a higher temperature.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
The eighth one

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
is

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
heating

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
all the gas

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
around the black hole

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
to a higher temperature.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
The ninth one

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
is

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
heating

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
all the

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
gas

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
around the black hole

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
to a higher temperature.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
This is because

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
the diffusion coefficient

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
determines

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
how much

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
cosmic ray

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
stays in the middle

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
of the galaxy.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
So how much cosmic ray

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
stays in the middle

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
determines how much chance

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
the cosmic ray will

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
collide with other gas

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
and produce gamma ray.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Since the total flux of

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
the gamma ray in the galaxy

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
has a limit,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
the diffusion coefficient

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
determines how much

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
the cosmic ray will

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
stay in the middle

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
of the galaxy.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Based on the speed of the

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
earthquake,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
you can calculate

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
the radius of

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
the cosmic ray

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
which will

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
be around

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
20-30 kpc.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
It will start to thermalize.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
The cosmic ray energy

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
will gradually heat up.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
First, let's look at

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
the momentum injection.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
This is the flux

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
of 36 quadrillion

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
CGS.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
This is the result of

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
sharp motion ray.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
When the momentum is not very strong,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
it does not affect

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
the galaxy at all.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
However, when the momentum

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
flux reaches 36 quadrillion

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
CGS,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
it turns off

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
all sharp motion rays.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
You can see that

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
the green line is not

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
on the plot at all.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
However,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
the gas in the middle

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
of the galaxy is blown away.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
You can see that

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
there is no gas

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
in the middle of the galaxy.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
You can see that

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
there is no gas in the middle of the galaxy.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
You can stop the cooling flow

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
and stop the sharp motion ray.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
You can stop the sharp motion ray.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
You can also blow away

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
all the surrounding gas.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
It is not consistent with observation.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Next, thermal heating.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
We have

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
uniform heat up gas.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
By gas heating,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
it is confined to

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
30 kpc or only heating

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
the particles around the black hole.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
The energy flux of the four of us

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
is about 10 to the power of

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
43 to the power of

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
45.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
The first one you see

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
is the produced

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
sharp motion ray

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
based on the energy flux and the different kernel size.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
The first one you see is the produced sharp motion ray based on the energy flux and the different kernel size.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
If you heat up these gases uniformly,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
you basically have no effect.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Even if you have a very high energy,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
it doesn't affect the sharp motion ray.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
But if you put the same energy

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
in the middle,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
heat up to 30 kpc

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
or

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
put all the energy

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
in the middle of the black hole,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
you can have a very big effect on the sharp motion ray.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
You can see that

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
the more energy you put in the middle,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
the stronger the

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
sharp motion ray suppression

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
you can produce

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
with the same energy.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
For example, in the black hole neighborhood,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
you can suppress the sharp motion ray

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
with very little energy.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
In fact, there are some results

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
that are inconsistent

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
with observation.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
In the first column,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
we draw the density profile.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
In the second column, we draw the temperature profile.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
In the third column, we draw the turbulent velocity

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
as a function of radius.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
At the end, you see that uniformly

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
heat up the gas,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
all the lines are still the same as the black curve.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
In fact, there is no change

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
in the energy input.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
But if you put all the energy

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
in the gas next to the black hole,

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
the effect is very explosive.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
For example, in the second column,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
you can see that

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
the temperature in the middle

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
can be added to a very high level.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
In addition,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
the gas is also added

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
to a very high level.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
In other words,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
the gas temperature is too high

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
and the speed is too fast.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
In fact,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
if you take

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
a medium-value kernel

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
and distribute the thermal heating energy

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
to about 30 kpc,

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
you can make it

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
a little more stable.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Your energy will not be so high

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
or your speed will not be so fast.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
But you will still produce

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
a negative temperature gradient.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
The middle is hotter and the outside is colder.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Basically, this is not the same as observation.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Basically, the observation is

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
that the middle is colder and the outside is hotter.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
The temperature gradient

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
is not the same as observation.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
If you really look at

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
your energy,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
we draw this picture

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
that you integrate

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
your cooling rate

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
from the middle to a certain radius

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
and your heating rate

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
from the middle to a certain radius.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
The heating rate is the red line

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
and the cooling rate is the blue line.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
The first thing you can compare

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
is that if you uniformly heat up the gas

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
from the top two lines,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
basically

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
most of your heating

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
is at the

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
outermost gas.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
But if you put all

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
the heating in the middle of the galaxy,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
the heating rate in the middle

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
will be much larger than the cooling rate.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Basically, this is why

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
you will have a very explosive result.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
If you use

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
a kernel like 30kpc,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
you can distribute

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
these heating to about 30kpc.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Indeed, in some situations,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
you can make your heating rate

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
slightly

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
similar to your cooling rate

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
in a larger radius,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
but the result is very fine-tuned.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
And even if you are very fine-tuned,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
you will still have problems

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
with your cooling rate.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
So basically,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
if you just want to use thermal heating

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
to compensate the cooling flow,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
you don't need to be very fine-tuned.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
You just need to make sure

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
that your heating rate

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
is exactly the same as the cooling rate

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
in each location of the galaxy.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Otherwise, you will easily heat up

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
some parts of the galaxy

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
or produce a very explosive result.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
So it's very fine-tuned.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Although it may work,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
it may not work.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Next, let's talk about

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Cosmic Ray Injection.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Cosmic Ray has

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
streaming instability

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
and heats up the gas.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
It also collides with the surrounding gas

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
and produces hydronic and coulomb heating.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Diffusion is set to 12.9 quadrillion

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
units of CGS.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Energy input is

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
between 12.4 quadrillion

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
and 12.4 quadrillion.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
These are

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
very efficient

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
to suppress shock measurement.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
You can see that

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
if you add energy

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
in the form of Cosmic Ray

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
to the surrounding gas,

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
you can still

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
efficiently suppress

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
shock measurement.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
If you look at

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
the density profile

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
and temperature profile,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
the reason why

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
shock measurement is suppressed

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
is because the temperature

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
is a little higher than

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
the surrounding gas.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
If you add the same amount

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
of energy

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
to the surrounding gas,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
one side is

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
in the form of

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Cosmic Ray,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
and the other side

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
is in the form of

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
hydronic,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
you can see that

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
in the form of Cosmic Ray,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
it reduces

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
the density

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
in the middle of the galaxy.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Basically,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
in the form of Cosmic Ray,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
it suppresses

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
shock measurement

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
more efficiently than

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
in the form of hydronic.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
This range is still

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
acceptable.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
I want to clarify

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
something.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
What do you mean by hydronic?

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Hydronic means that

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
the particle in that place

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
is now bigger than

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
V2,

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
but it is basically

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
a thermalized movement.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Do you have anything

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
that can transfer energy

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
from one to another,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
such as thermal radiation?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
No.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
We just say that

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
the heat energy

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
of the particle

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
does not generate

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
an average momentum

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
in a specific direction.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
No.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Another extreme

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
is Cosmic Ray,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
because all your energy

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
has a very clear

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
momentum direction.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
No.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Our model is

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Lagrangian-based code,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
so each particle

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
may be thousands of solar mass

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
or 10,000 solar mass.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
We model

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Cosmic Ray in the fluid limit,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
so it has a field

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
that is heat energy,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
and it has a field that is Cosmic Ray.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
We directly add its energy

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
to Cosmic Ray's field.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Cosmic Ray

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
is the same as

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
general heat energy.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
It has a couple of hydrodynamic equations.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Cosmic Ray

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
will do PDV work on gas.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
It also has energy loss.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Cosmic Ray energy loss

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
in the channel,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
such as collision heating

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
or streaming instability.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
It will reduce

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Cosmic Ray's energy

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
and turn it into heat energy.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Oh, I see.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Thank you.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Why can Cosmic Ray

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
do this?

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
On the one hand,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
there is a possibility

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
that Cosmic Ray

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
directly heats the gas.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Cosmic Ray

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
may be streaming heating

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
or collision

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and heat the gas.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
However,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
the panel below

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
is accumulative heating.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
We directly integrate

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
various channels

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
of Cosmic Ray's possible heating gas

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
from streaming

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
to collision

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
or loss.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
The black line

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
is the input of

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
all Cosmic Ray's energy.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
As you can see,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
there are not many Cosmic Ray

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
that turn into heat energy.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Especially in

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
the case of

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Star Formation,

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
which has been suppressed

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
and Quench.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
You can see that

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
less than 10% of Cosmic Ray

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
turns into heat energy.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
If you try to compare

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
the heat generated

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
by Cosmic Ray

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
from the middle to a certain radius

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
and the cooling rate

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
from the middle to a certain radius,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
you can see that

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
the energy input

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
from Cosmic Ray

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
is less than the cooling rate.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
This tells us that

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Cosmic Ray's heating

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
is not the main reason

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
for suppressing

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Star Formation or Cooling Flow.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
The heat provided

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
is not enough.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Cosmic Ray also provides

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
pressure support.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
It provides another form

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
of pressure

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
that pushes the gas

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
to the middle.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
We found that

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
this is important.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
If you try to calculate

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
two forces,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the first force is

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the gravitational force.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
The other force is

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
the pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
If there is a pressure gradient,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
you will produce something like a buoyancy

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
that pushes the gas outward.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
If you try to see

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
the difference between

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
the buoyancy of Cosmic Ray

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and the gravitational force,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
you can see that

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
under such a coefficient,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
the energy input

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
is about four to three times

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
greater than the

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You can see that

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
the red line below

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
is the gravitational force

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
per unit mass,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and the black line

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
is the energy input.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
You can see that

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
under such a coefficient,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
the energy input

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
is about four to three times

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
greater than the

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
gravitational force

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
per unit mass.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
In this case,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
you can prevent the gas

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
from moving to the middle

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
of the galaxy.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
The pressure gradient

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
of Cosmic Ray

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
can suppress star formation

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
because of the

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
pressure gradient of Cosmic Ray,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
not because Cosmic Ray

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
heats up the gas

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
around it.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Finally,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
let's talk about

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
turbulence.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Let's not ask where the

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
source of turbulence comes from.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Of course, it may be HMDB,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
or it may be for other reasons.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Anyway, let's stir the gas externally

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
in a 100 kV mode.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
We have uniformly stirred

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
the gas run.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
There is no space difference

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
between the first two runs.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
We have a core-turbulent

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
core run,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
which is the gas in the center of the galaxy.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
We try to make

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
the energy input greater

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
than 100 kV

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
in the form of turbulence.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
From 1 to 4,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
the gas in the center of the galaxy

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
is getting stronger and stronger.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The energy is getting higher and higher.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
From 1 to 4,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
the gas in the center of the galaxy

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
is getting stronger and stronger.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
This is the result of

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
star formation history.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
The upper panel is uniformly stirred

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
the gas case.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
The lower panel is the case

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
in the center of the galaxy.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
As you can see,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
the gas in the center of the galaxy

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
is getting stronger and stronger.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
This is the result of

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
star formation history.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
In fact,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
there are some things

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
that are different from observation.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
For example,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
if you uniformly stir the gas,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
there is no space difference

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
between the first two runs.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It is very easy for you

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
to put too much energy

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
into the outer part of the galaxy.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
The actual luminosity

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
is much lower.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
This is not the same as observation.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
On the other hand,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
if you stir the gas

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
too hard,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
you will also

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
increase the speed

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
of the gas.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Mach number is

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
the speed over

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
the sound speed.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Sound speed is

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
the speed

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
corresponding to the temperature.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
If you stir too hard,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
the Mach number

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
will be out of unity.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Of course, this is not the same as observation.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
However, in addition to these extreme situations,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
there is still some space

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
to suppress

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
star formation history.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
On the one hand,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
you still maintain the state

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
that is basically the same as observation,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
and you can also

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
suppress star formation rate

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and cooling flow.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So why does turbulent stirring

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
work?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
There are several possible reasons.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
The first one we might think of

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
is that you stir the gas

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and it produces some currents.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Those currents

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
may eventually dissipate into heat.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
These things

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
may eventually turn into heat

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and the temperature of the gas

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
will increase.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
On the other hand,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
when we stir the gas externally,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
the input energy

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
is much less than

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
the energy dissipation energy

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
of the gas,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
at least less than 1%.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
So the energy produced

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
by the channels

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
that turn the currents into heat

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
is far less than

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
the cooling flow.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
We found that the more important reason

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
is mixing.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
When you mix gas,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
on the one hand,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
you mix the cooled gas

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
into the CGM,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
into the gas

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
with lower density.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
If you check

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
the gas,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
the gas with high density

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
at first,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and check

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
how much of it

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
is dense

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and the temperature is low,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and how much of it

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
is hot,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
you can see that

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
half of the gas

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
is stirred externally.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You stir

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
the gas

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
to a higher radius

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
or to the gas

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
with lower density.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So mixing

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
is mixing

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
the cooler gas

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
with the denser gas

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
with lower density.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
We found that this is the more important reason

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
why it can suppress the cooling flow

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and suppress star formation rate.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
On the other hand,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
because you stirred these gases

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
and you provided

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
the extra turbulent pressure,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
the gas density

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
in the middle of the galaxy

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
is also reduced.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So you reduce the gas density

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and also reduce the cooling rate.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Because the cooling rate

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
is equal to the square of the gas density,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
the gas density is reduced

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and the cooling rate is also reduced.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
The cooling rate is also reduced

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
and the cooling time is also longer.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So this is another very important reason

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
because the density

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
in the middle of the galaxy is reduced.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
So we just talked about

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
turbulent and cosmic ray

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
can be more stabilized,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
stably suppressed.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Cooling flow and star formation rate

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
are also in the case of 12 and 14 square.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
We also try to

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
simulate thermal heating

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
if you confine it in a

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
more open space.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It seems that the thermal energy can also work.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
We try to put these three runs

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
in a smaller galaxy,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
12 square, 12 square, 13 square,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
see if it can work.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
These three runs are the ones we just said

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
are the slightly more successful runs in 12 and 14 square.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Let's try to see if these three models

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
can work in a smaller galaxy.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Let's see if these three models can work.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
For the thermal heating part,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
we scale

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
its total energy input

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
according to the

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
cooling rate of all its

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
gases.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
We scale our energy input

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
to a smaller galaxy.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
We also make the kernel size

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
correspond to the size of the galaxy

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and make the corresponding reduction.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
For the Cosmic Ray Injection run,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
we directly put

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
the thermal energy input

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
corresponding to the

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
cooling rate of the

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
corresponding galaxy.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
For the Turbulent Stirring run,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
we first put

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
the scale of the stirring mode

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and the kernel size

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
corresponding to the size of the galaxy

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
and make the corresponding scale.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We also put the force of your foot

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
corresponding to the circular velocity

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
above your foot's scale

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
and make the corresponding scale.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Because the size of the galaxy is different,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
the energy input and the scale input

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
are different.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
This is how we scale.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
As you can see,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
this is the star formation history

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
of the 10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
As you can see,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
the Cosmic Ray Injection

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
can crunch the galaxy

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
in all cases

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and the star formation rate

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
is very low.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
As for the thermal heating,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
it only works for the

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It doesn't affect

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
the 10th, 12th, and 13th galaxies.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
The star formation rate

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
is still very high.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
As for the Turbulent Stirring,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
it can only suppress

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
the star formation rate

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
13th, and 14th galaxies.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It doesn't affect

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
It just makes the star formation rate

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
jump up and down.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Why is that?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Why doesn't the

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
have the same effect

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
as the Turbulent Stirring and

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Thermal Heating?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
First, let's look at Thermal Heating.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
In the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
many gases

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
don't have high temperatures.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
The temperature

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
of the 10th, 12th,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
and 14th galaxies

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
is around

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
12°C to 12°C.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
These gases

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
are the main

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
cooling rate of

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
gases.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Thermal Heating

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
also provides

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
energy input,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
but it also

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
heats up

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
more heavy elements

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
and denser gases

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
to this temperature.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
The gases

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
cool down very quickly.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Many gases

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
are placed in the same position,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
which increases

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
the cooling rate.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
The picture on the right

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
shows the cooling rate

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
of the radio-integrated gases.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The cooling rate

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
is from the center of the galaxy

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
to the outer part of the galaxy.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
The black line shows

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
no energy input.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
The red line shows

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
thermal heating.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The thermal heating

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
provides energy,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
but it also increases

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
the cooling rate

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
The cooling rate

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
increases

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
the cooling rate

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
The cooling rate

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
is not that much higher

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
The cooling rate

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and 14th galaxies

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
is not so much higher

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
The movie on the left

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.820
shows the

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
cooling rate

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
The upper left corner

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
shows the temperature

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
At the end of the simulation,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
you can see

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
a lot of gas

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
being heated

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and rising

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
to a higher position.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
However,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
when it reaches a higher position,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
it cools down

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and starts to

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
rise again.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
This is a demonstration

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
of the cooling rate

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
The cooling rate

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and 14th galaxies

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
is not that much higher

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
The cooling rate

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
and 14th galaxies

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
is not that much higher

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
and the cooling rate

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
and 14th galaxies

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
is not so high

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
the cooling rate

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and 14th galaxies

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
is not so high

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
the cooling rate

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and 14th galaxies

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
is not so high

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
in the 10th, 12th,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and 14th galaxies.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and the cooling rate

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
in the 10th, 12th.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
galaxies

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
has a 때도

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
which means

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
just applying

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
as long as your kernel size

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
is not so low

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
around 50 kbz

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
turbulent stream can still work

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
in the 12th and 14th galaxies

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
star formation rate can still work

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
in the 10th, 12th, and 14th galaxies.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
this is my conclusion

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
the first part we said

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
the nitrogen feedback type solution

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
does not work

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
it only has a very small impact

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
the reason for the stator feedback

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
is that it only changes

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
the temperature

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
the main reason is that

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
the total energy input

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
is much smaller than the cooling rate

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
the magnetic field cosmic ground supernova

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
is also the same

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
the energy is not enough

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
the conduction

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
the big reason

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
is that it is suppressed

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
by the magnetic field line

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
because the direction of the temperature

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and the direction of the stator

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
is different

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
let me show you

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
so

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
the thermal conduction

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
will be projected to the direction of the stator

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
so it is suppressed

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
we also said

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
the morphology of star formation

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
basically

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
the impact of star formation

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
does not affect the cooling rate

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
we also talked about

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
the AGM feedback

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
we tried four different toy models

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
one is

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
momentum

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
one is thermal conduction

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
one is stator

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
one is cosmic ray

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
only add momentum

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
in the direction of R

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
basically

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
if the energy is not enough

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
you did not do anything

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
if the energy is enough

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
you did not do anything

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
it is not the same as the observation

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
if you

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
increase the temperature of the gas

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
it may work

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
it may reduce the star formation rate

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and the cooling flow

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
but you have to fine tune

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
you have to

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
let the heat

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
locally fit

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
the cooling speed of the gas

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
otherwise

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
it will overheat

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
thermal heating

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
is not efficient

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
if you add more energy

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
the cooling speed

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
will be faster

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
so it is not efficient

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
next is turbulent stirring

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
if you stir the gas

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
you can suppress the star formation rate

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
effectively

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
because you can

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
mix the gas

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
on the other hand

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
you can reduce the density

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
these are the two reasons

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
if you

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
control the stirring

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
within 100 kpc

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
you will not throw a lot of gas

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
into the galaxy

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and suppress the

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
extra luminosity

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
next is cosmic ray

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
this can also work

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
because of the pressure support

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
suppress the density

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
basically

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I did not talk about rejuvenation

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
basically

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
the result is

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
turbulent stirring and cosmic ray

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
are very important

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
to solve the cooling flow problem

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
and control the galaxy

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
thank you
