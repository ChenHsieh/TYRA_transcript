1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you very much today, Zhang Fengxun, PhD candidate, can give us an online speech.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I am the host, Zhou Zhiqian, who is currently working at MD Anderson as a postdoc.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let me introduce you a little bit about Zhang Fengxun's current education experience.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In 2009, Zhang Fengxun obtained his master's degree from the Department of Insectology at NTU.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In 2013, he obtained his master's degree from the Department of Ecology and Biochemistry at NTU.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then, he spent a year at UC California Berkeley as a visiting student researcher at the Department of Environmental Science Policy and Management.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then, he transferred to the University of Michigan to obtain his doctorate.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
His major is the School of Nature Research and Environmental.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now, he is already a PhD candidate.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We are very honored to invite him to give us an online speech.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The topic of his speech today is

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How does Ominary influence the effects of consumer diversity on research prey consumption?

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, let's invite Zhang Fengxun to give us a speech. Thank you.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank you for the host's introduction.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The topic of my speech today is mainly a framework for my PhD thesis.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And the results I have made recently.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's almost done, so I hope I can get some feedback from everyone.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My overarching question is

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How does Ominary influence the effects of consumer diversity on research prey consumption?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How many resources are consumed by different consumers?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Before answering this question, I would like to briefly explain to everyone that the topic I have made is

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The question I want to answer in this subfield is

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How does Ominary influence the functions of the entire system?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
These functions are shown in this picture.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How many resources are consumed?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How many biomass are produced?

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How are these functions influenced by the number of organisms in the system?

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
After many years of research,

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
we all think that

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
when there are more organisms in the system,

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the function of the system will be higher and higher.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is because different species have to live together at the same time.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They have to use different resources.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If the food I eat is different from the food you eat, we can live in harmony.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is the concept of resource partitioning.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If it is a picture, you can look at it.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Assuming that the different X-axis on the right is a different resource.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For example, temperature or different pH of the soil.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The white circle in the middle is the resources needed by different organisms.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If different organisms occupy different resources,

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
they can live in harmony.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In addition to living in harmony, they can also use these resources more efficiently.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is our consensus in the BEF subfield.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But there is a problem.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There are more than three-quarters of the research in this subfield.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's all experimented with plants.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
For example, in the picture on the left,

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
how many plants are there in the grass?

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How many different kinds of grass?

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How many organisms are there?

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If it's in the animal community,

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
will we find the same thing?

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The answer is,

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Generally, we think that when the consumer diversity increases,

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the ecosystem function should also increase.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But the pattern, the signal,

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is not as obvious as in the plant community.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
For example, in 2013, the Meta-Analysis

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
reported that it reviewed more than 40 studies.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
More than half of them said that we did not see a positive correlation.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In other words, diversity does not have a positive impact on the function.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
More than half of them said that we did not see a positive impact.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
At this time, we will ask,

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
why is it like this?

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is it because animals and plants are different?

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't they need to partition their resources to coexist?

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Or are there other factors?

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They don't need to partition to coexist.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This hypothesis is basically invalid.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because it is impossible for two societies to use the same thing

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and live well together.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It should be said that this case is very rare.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
For example, in this study,

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it is a very famous study.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It is in the seaweed bed.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The picture on the left is the seaweed bed in the sea.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There are different grazers on the seaweed bed.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You can think of it as different little prawns, little worms.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They will eat these seaweed.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They will also eat the algae on the seaweed.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
As you can see,

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
when we have more grazers,

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
the overall biomass of the grazer can grow more.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We can also eat less algae.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
For example, we still see diversity in the consumer community.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It has a positive impact on the function.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Especially the consumption of resources has a positive impact.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They also reported that

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
they saw this positive impact

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
because different grazers

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
tend to stay in different parts of the seaweed.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
For example, this grazer will be in a shorter place.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This grazer will be in a straight place.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So they actually use different spaces.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In other words, they really use different resources.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So resource partitioning has a positive impact on diversity and function.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In other words, resource partitioning has a positive impact on function.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There is no problem.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But in fact, there are many experiments.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They said that animals not only eat the seaweed below.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Many animals actually eat other animals.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In other words, like humans,

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we don't just eat plants.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We don't just eat meat.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We eat everything.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We are solid.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
In other words, this meta-analysis

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
in the report of 2007,

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it is a review of many food webs.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Many grazers measure their stomach content.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It really depends on what they eat.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They found that the vast majority of animals

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
are omnivores.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They are all solid.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The simplest example of a solid omnivore

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
is when we have a very simple food web.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Suppose there are only four species.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
With two animals.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The simplest is called Intra-Cultivated.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
For example, there is an animal that only eats

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
the resource below its stomach.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
These species.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But there is another animal.

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In addition to eating these resources,

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
it also ate the species that just ate the resource.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So this feeding link is the simplest omnivore.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So this is Intra-Cultivated IGP.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The simplest example of an omnivore.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
When the omnivore occurs,

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
or when the Intra-Cultivated IGP occurs,

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
many studies have told us

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that it will reduce the entire consumer function.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
For example, in this study,

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Grasshopper in this study.

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What is this called?

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What is it called?

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Tooth bug.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
An insect that only eats grass.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I forgot what it's called in Chinese.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's a pest.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then it puts this pest

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
together with many other different animals.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
See if these animals can eat this pest.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So in this experiment,

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
if there is no pest,

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
nothing,

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
only Grasshopper alone,

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it can grow so much.

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But if there are some pests,

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
some other consumers,

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it only eats this grasshopper,

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it can eat it very low,

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
almost none.

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But if I put a lot of species in,

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
because these animals will eat each other

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and eat each other,

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
so they eat less grasshopper overall.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In other words,

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
when the omnivore occurs,

163
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
or intragural predation,

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a simple case occurs,

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
we will see that

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
consumer diversity

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
has a negative effect on the function.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So we can draw

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
a very simple memory map.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When resource partitioning occurs,

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the consumer function will increase.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But when intragural predation occurs,

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
this function will decrease.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Consumer diversity

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
will have a negative effect on the function.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So in order to study

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
who is more important,

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I asked a question.

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
My Ph.D.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The main question I want to answer is

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
resource partitioning

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and omnivore,

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
these two things,

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
these two forces,

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
who is more important

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
to determine

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
animal diversity

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and pre-consumption.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have four ways

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to answer this big question.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The first is

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
because I don't know

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
how omnivore,

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I know it's probably negative,

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but I don't know

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
how strong it is

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
to eliminate the benefits

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
of resource partitioning.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So I need to have a hypothesis first.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So the first step

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is to make a mathematical model,

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
a theoretical model,

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to help me

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
generate a hypothesis.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can continue to do experiments later.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The second step is

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I have a small experiment

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
in the lab

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to verify that

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the mathematical model

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
can really be discovered

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in a biological object,

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
not just a mathematical calculation.

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then it seems like

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I see something like this.

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The next step is

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
because it was all in math just now,

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
it was all on paper,

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
or it was all just

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
in this kind of

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
well-controlled environment

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
in the lab.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So the third step is

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I think the most important part

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
of this paper is

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that I want to be able to

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
discover or not discover

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
this theory or experiment

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
in the wild.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This is how I can tell people

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
whether this is important or not.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is this thing

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
important or not?

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So the first step

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is to make a mathematical model.

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This mathematical model

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
is actually very simple.

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I believe you all understand.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just a very simple

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
four ordinary differential equations

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
to describe the change in time

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
in a group.

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Here we see P1 and P2

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
are the densities of a certain species,

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
or biomass.

246
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The first one is that

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
their population growth rate

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
will follow this function.

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Then this function

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
is actually a logistic regression,

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
but we don't have to understand it too much.

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Anyway, it will grow.

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There are two reasons for P1 and P2.

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It will grow.

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Then there are two zoomers,

256
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
which are two animals.

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
They will eat these two resources.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Z1 and Z2 will eat P1 and P2.

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Then their consumption term

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
is described as their mathematical value.

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Then here is a more important point.

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I put a parameter S.

263
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I use S to adjust

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
how much Z1 and Z2

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
are partitioned

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
or not partitioned.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So for example,

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
if Z1 is 1,

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
if S1 is 1,

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Z1 will eat P2 completely,

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but it doesn't eat P1 at all.

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If S2 is 1,

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Z2 will eat P1 completely,

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and Z2 doesn't eat P2 at all.

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Or in other words,

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
if Z1 or Z2 is 0.5,

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
if S1 or S2 is 0.5,

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Z1 and Z2

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
will completely overlap their resources.

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That is, half of their P1 and P2.

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Next,

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
one of the consumers,

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Z1, will be eaten by Z2.

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I just described the simplest

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
example of an omnivore,

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
which is inter-game partition.

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Z1 will be eaten by Z2.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So after having this model,

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can see these two parameters,

290
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
S1 and S2,

291
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
which will affect

292
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
how many resources are eaten overall.

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I won't go into

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the details of how to analyze this model.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's just a process

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
of writing ODE.

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then,

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
the most important contribution

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
of this model is

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to generate this hypothesis.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
In other words,

302
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
when these two species

303
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
are in this state,

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
the overall resource density

305
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
will increase

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
with the intra-game partition,

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
which is the alpha just now,

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and then decrease and then increase.

309
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In other words,

310
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
this partition is completely different

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
from the intra-game partition

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
we thought at the beginning

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
or the omnivore

314
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
which will have a negative effect

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
on the consumer function.

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It will eat more resources

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
when the omnivore is weak,

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and then eat fewer resources

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
when the omnivore is strong.

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's why we see

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
this concave-up function.

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This pattern is

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
no matter how high

324
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
or low my resource partition is,

325
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can see this function

326
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
going up and down.

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
For example, the intra-game partition

328
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
will let the consumer eat more resources

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
than the omnivore.

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Now we have a hypothesis.

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We are going to see

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
whether this math tells me

333
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
whether this pattern can be observed

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
on a real organism.

335
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So I did a little experiment.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The first one is

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
my resource has

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
a bunch of bacteria.

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
These three are different bacteria.

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Then there is

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the first consumer,

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
which is the intra-game partition.

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The first one only eats bacteria.

344
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The second one

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
is the consumer

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
that eats bacteria at the same time

347
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and eats

348
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the other

349
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
consumer species.

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So this is the

351
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
mathematical model

352
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
of the real organism.

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't control

354
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
whether I want this one to eat more

355
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
or less,

356
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
so I have to adjust

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
or manipulate the

358
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
intra-game partition strength.

359
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The method I use is

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to take a net

361
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and let the small

362
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
intra-game partition

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that only eats bacteria

364
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
run around.

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
However, the big one

366
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
will be limited

367
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to the small one

368
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
if it is observed.

369
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Then I use this net

370
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to adjust

371
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the position

372
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
in the bottle

373
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
of the experiment.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can adjust

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
how many

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
consumers

377
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
will be exposed

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
to the risk of being eaten by the big one,

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
which is how high

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
or how close

381
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
their contact probability is.

382
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If this net

383
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
is placed in the middle

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
of the intra-game partition,

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
then the

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
big one is less than the small one.

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But if this net is

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
only about 20%

389
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
of the space

390
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
for the big one

391
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
to move,

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
then the intra-game partition strength

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
is 20.

394
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The above picture

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
shows that I cut off

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
the bottom of the glass bottle

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and glued the net in

398
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
to make an experiment

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
jar.

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
After this

401
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
is done,

402
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I can test this hypothesis.

403
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I want to see

404
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
if the density of

405
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the bacteria

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
increases

407
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
with the

408
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
intra-game partition strength

409
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and decreases

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
with the contact probability.

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
After the experiment,

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
we can see

413
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
that there is a

414
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
concave fob.

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
When the intra-game partition

416
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
increases,

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
when the resource density

418
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
reaches an equilibrium,

419
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
when the population

420
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
does not change too much,

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the bacteria density

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
will decrease first.

423
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Next,

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I want to explain

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
whether this pattern is

426
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
true or not,

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and whether the mechanism

428
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
is like my mathematical model.

429
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If I put the mathematical model

430
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
on this experimental result,

431
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you will find that

432
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
this black dot is

433
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
the result of the experiment.

434
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This curve is the density

435
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
predicted by the mathematical model.

436
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You will find that they are quite different.

437
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This curve and

438
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
these black dots

439
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
hardly explain anything.

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They just have a concave fob function.

441
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This pattern is qualitatively

442
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
correct, but

443
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
quantitatively is

444
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
not accurate at all.

445
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't use my model to explain

446
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
the result I saw in the lab.

447
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There is a very important reason

448
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
why I can't use

449
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
my model.

450
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
When I describe the intra-game partition,

451
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I use a type 1 functional response.

452
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This type 1 functional response

453
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
means that

454
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
no matter how many prey

455
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
come to me,

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I will eat them.

457
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is actually

458
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
unrealistic.

459
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How can we keep eating

460
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and eating and eating?

461
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Its function is a linear

462
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
upward. This is not a reasonable

463
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
state.

464
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't want to use this function.

465
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I changed it to a more complex

466
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
non-linear function.

467
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It will have a sense of satiety

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
when it eats.

469
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Even if a bunch of food

470
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
comes, it will not

471
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
continue to eat more.

472
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is called type 2 functional response.

473
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It looks like this.

474
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
When I change this

475
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
functional response from type 1 to type 2,

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
my model prediction

477
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
will be closer to

478
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
the result of the lab.

479
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Although it is not

480
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
exactly the same,

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
the explanation

482
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
can explain

483
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
about 70% of the variation.

484
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Mainly these two points.

485
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The lab observed that

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
it was low enough.

487
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't know why the model can't

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
be so low.

489
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Almost 70%

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
of the explanation power

491
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
is quite satisfactory.

492
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We can use

493
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
this model that has been changed

494
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
to explain

495
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
what really happened

496
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
in the real organism.

497
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The model of type 2 functional response

498
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that has been changed

499
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
can not only explain

500
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
bacterial density,

501
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
but also explain

502
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the density of

503
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
the other two consumers,

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Intragalepra and Praetor.

505
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It also explains about 70%.

506
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The prediction function

507
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
is very similar.

508
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We can use this model

509
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to explain what really happened

510
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
in the organism.

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
As I said,

512
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
it is type 2 functional response.

513
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
When there is a little bit of

514
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Intragalepra

515
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and Praetor,

516
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
when there is a little bit of

517
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Praetor,

518
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the Praetor

519
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
is more nutritious

520
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
than the bacteria.

521
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We can't see the bacteria.

522
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The Praetor is bigger

523
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and more nutritious.

524
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
For example,

525
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
if we eat a little bit of

526
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
meat,

527
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in theory,

528
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
we will grow bigger and healthier.

529
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Although there are vegetarians,

530
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
if we eat a little bit of meat,

531
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
a little bit of food,

532
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
we will grow more.

533
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We can see that

534
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Intragalepra and Praetor

535
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
really grow bigger

536
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and eat a little bit.

537
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So,

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
when there are a lot of big Praetor

539
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and

540
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
a few small Praetor,

541
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
they can eat

542
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
more bacteria

543
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
overall.

544
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
However,

545
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
when the Intragalepra

546
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
is very strong,

547
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the big Praetor will be full.

548
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
As I said,

549
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
the big Praetor

550
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
will be full.

551
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
When I eat a certain amount of food,

552
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I won't eat

553
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
more food

554
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
because I am full.

555
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So, when the big Praetor

556
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is full,

557
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
it doesn't eat bacteria.

558
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It doesn't need to eat bacteria.

559
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The small Intragalepra

560
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
is eaten by the big Praetor.

561
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The small Praetor is getting smaller.

562
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The big Praetor doesn't change much.

563
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So,

564
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
when the two Praetors

565
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
are eating each other,

566
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the bacteria are very happy

567
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
because no one eats them.

568
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So, the biological mechanism

569
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
behind this

570
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
is like this.

571
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Because

572
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
there is

573
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
a satiated

574
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
functional response,

575
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
we can see that

576
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
weak Intragalepra

577
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
will increase overall consumption

578
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and decrease overall consumption.

579
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That is to say, it will reduce

580
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
the basal resource density first and then increase.

581
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This is

582
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
what the lab

583
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and math tell us.

584
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This thing may happen.

585
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But

586
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
in the paper ice

587
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and in the lab's

588
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
good and perfect environment,

589
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
will this result happen

590
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
in the wild?

591
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Will you see

592
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
the positive impact of resource partitioning?

593
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Intragalepra will be positive first.

594
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
When it is very weak, it is positive first.

595
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Then negative again.

596
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Will you see this?

597
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So I

598
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
need to use

599
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
more real data

600
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to do this reality check.

601
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So what I want to check

602
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
is that I need to know

603
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
the resource consumption

604
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
or

605
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
resource community biomass

606
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
will it really decrease

607
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
with the increase of consumer diversity?

608
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That is to say, when I have

609
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
a lot of different animals

610
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
or different kinds of consumers,

611
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
will they really eat more

612
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
of their prey?

613
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Will this

614
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
impact

615
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
when these consumers

616
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
eat each other

617
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
not so seriously,

618
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
but not so seriously,

619
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
will this impact increase?

620
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And when people eat each other

621
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and it gets more and more exaggerated,

622
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
will this impact decrease?

623
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
This is what I want to test in the end.

624
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You can't see this pattern in the wild.

625
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So my

626
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
first method is

627
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I went to

628
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
find a big

629
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
data set. This data set

630
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
is the EPA in the United States.

631
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Every

632
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
five years,

633
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
they will

634
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
go to every lake in the United States,

635
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
every state, every place, every lake.

636
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He went to do a sample.

637
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then

638
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
after choosing more than 1,000 lakes,

639
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
he will measure how many kinds of

640
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
phytoplankton in this lake,

641
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
which is the basic

642
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
resource in the lake.

643
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They are food. How many

644
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
different kinds of phytoplankton do they have?

645
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
How many kinds of phytoplankton are there?

646
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
How much biomass is there in total?

647
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Next is their

648
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
predator.

649
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This is the first

650
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
consumer in the entire lake.

651
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It will eat

652
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
those small creatures

653
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
like phytoplankton.

654
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It will also measure

655
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
how many of them are

656
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
diverse in density.

657
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Then

658
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
in this data set,

659
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
the only pity is

660
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
that he didn't really measure

661
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
whether the

662
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
omelette is strong or weak.

663
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He didn't do an experiment

664
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
to measure how many

665
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
phytoplankton or how many small

666
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
consumers are eaten by large consumers.

667
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He didn't measure this thing.

668
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Because there are too many lakes, he can't do so many experiments.

669
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
But he reported that

670
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
he saw this phytoplankton,

671
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
this consumer,

672
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
it will eat other consumers

673
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
or not.

674
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Is it vegetarian, meat-eating,

675
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
it is solid.

676
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So I use

677
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
this low plankton community

678
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
how many are

679
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
omnivore

680
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
as a

681
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
degree of omnivore proxy.

682
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This is not very good, but it is

683
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
in this data

684
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you can get

685
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
evidence

686
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
information.

687
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Then there are other

688
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
water temperature, pH,

689
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
electricity,

690
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
other data.

691
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So after having this big data,

692
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I will test

693
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
this hypothesis.

694
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The first is to look at

695
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the relationship between resource consumption and consumer diversity.

696
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Will this relationship

697
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
increase or decrease

698
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
with the omnivore?

699
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Before I actually did this experiment,

700
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
in fact, three years ago,

701
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
someone had used this data

702
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
to do a very preliminary

703
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and basic analysis.

704
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
He just put the

705
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
resource community of biomass,

706
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
how many resources are there,

707
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
to return to other factors.

708
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Then I found

709
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
how many kinds of

710
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
resource diversity

711
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and the

712
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
egg and phosphorus in the lake.

713
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
These three are the most important

714
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
effects of phytoplankton

715
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
biomass.

716
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
However,

717
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
as I just said,

718
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
this data set

719
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
comes from the whole of the United States.

720
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
In other words,

721
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
the lake in California and the lake in Michigan

722
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
will definitely look different.

723
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But when they did this analysis,

724
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
they did not consider this matter.

725
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He treats everything as the same.

726
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So what he wants to see is an overall overview.

727
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So in fact, there are a lot of

728
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
biological interactions

729
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
in the middle that

730
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
will be ignored.

731
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So to test this,

732
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
to do my analysis,

733
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I have to make their analysis

734
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
more complicated.

735
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The so-called more complicated

736
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
is the first one,

737
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
because these lakes belong to

738
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
different regions,

739
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
belong to different ecoregions.

740
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Everyone can think of ecoregions as

741
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
different ecoregions,

742
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it means that there are different

743
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
large-scale biological,

744
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
chemical, geological,

745
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and water-temperature historical factors

746
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
that cause this lake to be

747
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
fundamentally different.

748
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So my first step

749
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
is to make this model

750
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
more complicated.

751
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I added special heterogeneity

752
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
to this model.

753
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
In other words,

754
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
the model just now

755
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
estimates only one effect,

756
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
that is,

757
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
biodiversity.

758
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Only one value will affect

759
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
the community biomass.

760
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But now I make this effect

761
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
depend on different ecoregions.

762
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
In other words, I can make it

763
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
have different effects

764
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
in different ecoregions.

765
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So maybe in California,

766
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
this is very strong,

767
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
but in Michigan, this may be very low.

768
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I consider this randomness.

769
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is the first

770
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
complexity.

771
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The second is

772
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I really want to test my prediction.

773
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I added open-ended speech richness.

774
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And I made this effect

775
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
depend on another variable.

776
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
In other words,

777
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
this is a general return,

778
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
y equals ax plus b.

779
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I just need to look at

780
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
how big or how small ax's a is.

781
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I know what the impact of x on y is.

782
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is the most basic return.

783
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But I don't want it now.

784
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Community biomass equals

785
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
a factor called beta

786
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
multiplied by

787
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
open-ended diversity.

788
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But this beta is

789
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
another response variable.

790
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So this is the second hierarchy.

791
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
In other words,

792
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
my model is

793
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
not a plane.

794
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It has many layers.

795
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
When it becomes many layers,

796
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the original analysis method

797
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
can't handle this complexity.

798
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So what I have to do is

799
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Bayesian hierarchical model.

800
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I didn't go into too much detail

801
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
about how to do Bayesian.

802
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
In short,

803
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
what I want to answer is

804
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
even if I measure this big data,

805
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
when I see the probability of

806
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
this effect,

807
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and when I see

808
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
the effect of one variable

809
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
on the other variable,

810
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
what is the probability?

811
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The data

812
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is like I just said,

813
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
it will be measured every five years.

814
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The last two years are 2007 and 2012.

815
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
In 2007,

816
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I did

817
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
a full model.

818
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I will do some model selection

819
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
to remove this

820
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
to see if it has

821
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
a higher or lower

822
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
ability to explain this model.

823
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Or the probability is higher or lower.

824
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
After doing the model selection,

825
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
finally,

826
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
in 2007,

827
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
the best model is

828
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
the three variables just now.

829
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
They are all selected.

830
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Specialty, Trojanity

831
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
are very important.

832
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Let these effects depend on

833
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
special ecoregion.

834
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And I also chose

835
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
another variable.

836
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This picture shows

837
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
the posterior I just mentioned.

838
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Even this data,

839
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I see

840
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
what is the probability

841
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
of the effect of this variable.

842
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
That is the posterior probability.

843
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So we can see

844
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
the three most important variables

845
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
are still selected.

846
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But these three variables

847
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
are not a value anymore.

848
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
They come from a distribution.

849
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Give me an ecoregion,

850
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I can tell you

851
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
what the effect of these three variables

852
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
in that ecoregion will be.

853
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Then there is a

854
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
very awkward position,

855
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
which is

856
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Zofan's Diversity.

857
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It seems to be important,

858
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
but it doesn't seem to be.

859
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you add it in,

860
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
you can increase

861
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
the model's posterior probability.

862
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You can also increase

863
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
the model's ability to explain

864
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
or even predict.

865
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But its credible interval

866
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
overlaps with 0.

867
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
In terms of statistics,

868
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
this is the story of 2007.

869
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But by 2012,

870
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
this model has changed.

871
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
This model adds

872
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Zofan's Diversity.

873
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Zofan's Diversity is

874
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
an important variable

875
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
in the data of 2002.

876
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It can help explain

877
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the variable of Zofan's Community.

878
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And this effect depends on

879
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Omnivory.

880
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But there is another awkward situation.

881
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Although it depends on Omnivory,

882
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
adding it in

883
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
is helpful to this model.

884
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But the effect of Omnivory

885
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
cannot be detected.

886
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Just like

887
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
the awkward effect of

888
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Zofan in 2007.

889
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Adding it in is useful,

890
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
but I can't know

891
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
how much it is.

892
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But overall,

893
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
these three variables are the most important.

894
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Adding Special Issue Genuity

895
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
is also very helpful to this model.

896
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Hello.

897
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Can you hear me?

898
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Hello.

899
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I missed the first five minutes.

900
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Can we interrupt you

901
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
to ask a question?

902
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Or do we have to ask at the end?

903
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's okay.

904
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I have a question.

905
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Because

906
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
these variables are

907
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
actually meaningful variables.

908
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Like Total Nitrogen,

909
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Total blah blah blah,

910
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
have you ever considered

911
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
combining these variables?

912
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
For example,

913
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
finding an eigenvalue

914
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
or linear combination.

915
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh.

916
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I can do that.

917
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But if I

918
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
find its eigenvalue,

919
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I will still lose

920
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
correlation.

921
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Secondly,

922
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
the correlation between these variables

923
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
is not very big.

924
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So I will just

925
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
treat each variable as an eigenvalue.

926
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh.

927
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Makes sense.

928
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeah.

929
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Nitrogen and Phosphorus.

930
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This is a good question.

931
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Nitrogen and Phosphorus

932
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
are highly correlated.

933
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So in the model,

934
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I let these two things

935
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I put their covariance matrix

936
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
in the model,

937
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
but I didn't draw it directly.

938
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, I see. Thank you.

939
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Hi.

940
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh, I almost forgot.

941
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So,

942
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
in 2007 and 2012,

943
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
in 2007 and 2012,

944
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
the models we saw

945
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
were different.

946
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Given 2007 and given 2012,

947
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
the most likely

948
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
explanation of these data

949
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
was different.

950
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
As time goes by,

951
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I might see that

952
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
these variables are not important.

953
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But how did they change?

954
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Even this data,

955
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
because I only have two

956
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
snapshots,

957
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and they are so far apart.

958
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I don't know how they changed.

959
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But there is one thing

960
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I can point out.

961
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
In 2007,

962
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
the local diversity

963
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
was awkward.

964
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It was on the edge.

965
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But in 2012,

966
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
it was really

967
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
different from 0.

968
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So,

969
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
when I dug up

970
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
these raw data,

971
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I found that in 2012,

972
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
on average,

973
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
every lake had 8 different

974
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
low content.

975
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Compared to 2007,

976
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I don't know how this happened.

977
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But if this happened,

978
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
it means that in 2012,

979
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
in recent years,

980
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
there are more animals

981
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
moving around.

982
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
With more animals,

983
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
it's easier to see that

984
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
different animals eat different foods.

985
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Or they have a different impact

986
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
on the biomass of low content.

987
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
For example,

988
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
the effect of this variable

989
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
is easier to detect.

990
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But in 2012,

991
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
in 2007 and 2012,

992
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I can explain that

993
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
low content diversity

994
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
can be detected.

995
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But other variables,

996
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
like Omnivore,

997
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
why it wasn't detected

998
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
in 2007 and 2012,

999
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I don't really understand.

1000
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
They are basically the same.

1001
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
A lot of Omnivores are the same.

1002
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But in 2012,

1003
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
it was detected.

1004
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
In 2007, it wasn't.

1005
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Given this data,

1006
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I can't answer this question.

1007
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Lastly,

1008
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
this is

1009
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
the biggest problem

1010
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
of Shrubster.

1011
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
As I said,

1012
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
the degree of Omnivore

1013
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
is not measured.

1014
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It doesn't measure how many small animals

1015
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
are eaten,

1016
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
or how many overboars

1017
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
are eaten by

1018
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
plants and animals.

1019
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's not measured.

1020
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's a proxy.

1021
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's hard to verify

1022
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
because

1023
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
it's a proxy.

1024
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I can't detect

1025
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
the Omnivore.

1026
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Maybe it's because

1027
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Omnivore is too

1028
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
unimportant.

1029
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Only in math,

1030
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
or in a

1031
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
well-controlled environment,

1032
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I can see this effect.

1033
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So when I go out,

1034
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
it's not important.

1035
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It won't happen.

1036
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
My PhD will know what I'm doing.

1037
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's a sad

1038
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
conclusion.

1039
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
However,

1040
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
to solve the Omnivore

1041
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
consumption problem,

1042
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I have another

1043
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
experiment.

1044
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I go to the lake

1045
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
to get water

1046
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
to feed these animals.

1047
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I measure

1048
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
how many phytoplankton

1049
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
are eaten by

1050
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
small animals

1051
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and how many by large animals.

1052
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Overall,

1053
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
how many phytoplankton

1054
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
are eaten.

1055
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I can measure

1056
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the consumption

1057
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
of phytoplankton.

1058
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's the most important

1059
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
response variable.

1060
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
How is it affected by

1061
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
zooplankton diversity?

1062
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
How is this effect

1063
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
strengthened by Omnivore?

1064
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
In the experiment,

1065
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I measured

1066
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
these things.

1067
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
However,

1068
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it took too much energy.

1069
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I can only get

1070
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
30 points.

1071
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I spent two summers

1072
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
to get 30 points.

1073
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Let me show you

1074
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
my experiment.

1075
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I

1076
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
put a

1077
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
boat on the

1078
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
lake.

1079
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I drove the boat to the lake

1080
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
to get water.

1081
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
After I got water,

1082
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I put it back in the bottle.

1083
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
There are animals

1084
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and plants in the bottle.

1085
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I left it in the lake

1086
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
for a day.

1087
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I checked

1088
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
how many animals and plants

1089
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
disappeared.

1090
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
However,

1091
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the first result

1092
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
disappeared.

1093
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So I skipped it.

1094
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I can

1095
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
share the results

1096
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
with you later.

1097
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Let me show you

1098
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
the animals

1099
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
in the experiment.

1100
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Microzooplankton

1101
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
look like

1102
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
dinoflagellates.

1103
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
There are also

1104
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
small ciliates

1105
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
in the experiment.

1106
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
There are also large ciliates.

1107
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That's all for today.

1108
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
In theory,

1109
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
this experiment

1110
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
is promising.

1111
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
However, it is too labor intensive.

1112
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I can't

1113
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
get a good result

1114
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
from this experiment.

1115
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The sample size is too small.

1116
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I skip

1117
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
the experiment result.

1118
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I will share

1119
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
the results with you later.

1120
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Thank you

1121
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
for your attention.

1122
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I will leave

1123
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
my email address

1124
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
at the end of the video.

1125
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
If you have any questions

1126
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
or suggestions,

1127
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
please

1128
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
leave a message.

1129
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Thank you.

1130
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Thank you.

1131
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Thank you.

1132
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Thank you,

1133
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
for the wonderful

1134
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
presentation.

1135
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Let's see if anyone

1136
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
has any questions

1137
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
about

1138
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Microzooplankton.

1139
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Let me ask a

1140
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
naive question.

1141
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
All your research

1142
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
focuses on

1143
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
phytoplankton

1144
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and zooplankton.

1145
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Can zooplankton

1146
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
be applied

1147
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
to larger

1148
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
subspecies?

1149
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Large subspecies

1150
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
are fine.

1151
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I can't

1152
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
answer

1153
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
this question

1154
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
confidently.

1155
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I can't scale up

1156
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
to larger animals.

1157
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's complicated.

1158
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
For example,

1159
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
humans or

1160
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
cats and dogs

1161
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
are harder to

1162
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
quantify

1163
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
than

1164
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
small animals.

1165
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's hard to

1166
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
systematically collect

1167
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
data.

1168
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm not sure

1169
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
if I can

1170
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
scale up to

1171
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
large animals.

1172
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
If there's a system

1173
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that can measure

1174
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
zooplankton and

1175
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
consumer diversity,

1176
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
this system

1177
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
can be applied

1178
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
to my framework

1179
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
to see if

1180
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
different systems

1181
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
have different

1182
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
effects.

1183
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Let me follow up

1184
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
with a question.

1185
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Zooplankton

1186
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
doesn't look

1187
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
complicated.

1188
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's just

1189
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
eating and being eaten.

1190
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm thinking

1191
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
that

1192
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
when zooplankton

1193
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
eats

1194
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
phytoplankton

1195
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and is

1196
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
being eaten,

1197
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
doesn't it have

1198
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
mechanisms

1199
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
that make

1200
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
zooplankton

1201
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
eat phytoplankton?

1202
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm not sure

1203
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
if I can

1204
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
scale up to

1205
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
large animals.

1206
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm not sure

1207
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
if I can

1208
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
scale up to

1209
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
zooplankton

1210
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and eat

1211
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
phytoplankton.

1212
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm not sure

1213
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
if I can

1214
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
scale up to

1215
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
large animals.

1216
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm not sure

1217
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
if I can

1218
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
scale up to

1219
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
zooplankton

1220
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and eat

1221
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
phytoplankton.

1222
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm not sure

1223
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
if I can

1224
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
scale up to

1225
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
large animals.

1226
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm not sure

1227
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
if I can

1228
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
scale up to

1229
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
zooplankton

1230
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and eat

1231
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
phytoplankton.

1232
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm not sure

1233
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
if I can

1234
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
scale up to

1235
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
large animals.

1236
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm not sure

1237
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
if I can

1238
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
scale up to

1239
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
large animals.

1240
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm not sure

1241
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
if I can

1242
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
scale up to

1243
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
large animals.

1244
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And if I can

1245
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
scale up to

1246
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
a whole family.

1247
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
If I can

1248
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
scale up to

1249
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
a whole family.

1250
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And if I can

1251
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
scale up to

1252
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
a whole family.

1253
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Because I'm not sure

1254
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
if I can

1255
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
scale up to

1256
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
a whole family.

1257
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Because I'm not sure

1258
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
if I can scale up

1259
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
to a whole family.

1260
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Maybe the analysis

1261
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
can help someone.

1262
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Maybe the analysis

1263
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
can help someone.

1264
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Because

1265
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I live in a small nature.

1266
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And my house

1267
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,360
has withrawn

1268
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,000
years ago.

1269
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So if

1270
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I do the analysis

1271
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I can scale up

1272
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
to a whole family.

1273
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
For example,

1274
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
a pond can count

1275
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
tens of thousands

1276
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
of plants.

1277
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
tens of thousands

1278
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
of individuals.

1279
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And animals

1280
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
can count hundreds of thousands of individuals.

1281
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So the distribution

1282
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
of variables

1283
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
is actually

1284
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
systematically dominant

1285
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
but not statistically dominant.

1286
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Statistically uncertainty dominant.

1287
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I think so.

1288
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I don't understand

1289
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
what you mean.

1290
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
What I mean is

1291
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
the number of

1292
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
animals you count

1293
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
is so large

1294
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
that

1295
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
there is no calculation

1296
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
error.

1297
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The distribution width

1298
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
mainly comes from

1299
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the difference in region

1300
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
and year, right?

1301
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yes.

1302
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
We believe so.

1303
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
For example,

1304
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
the species

1305
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
of phytoplankton.

1306
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I do one thing.

1307
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I verify

1308
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
the species

1309
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
of phytoplankton.

1310
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
How to say?

1311
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I don't count

1312
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
the number of species.

1313
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I consider

1314
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
all samples

1315
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
given sampling effort.

1316
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I can draw a curve.

1317
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Sampling effort

1318
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
is x-axis.

1319
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Y-axis is species richness.

1320
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Given a sampling effort,

1321
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I can estimate

1322
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
how many species

1323
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
the sampling effort should have.

1324
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
This curve

1325
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
is calculated

1326
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
from all data.

1327
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So

1328
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I assume

1329
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
my sampling is

1330
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
representative

1331
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to that lake.

1332
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I can't verify this.

1333
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But I count a lot.

1334
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
This assumption should be possible.

1335
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I also consider

1336
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
the sampling effort.

1337
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I don't count

1338
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the number of species.

1339
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I count a lot

1340
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and get a lot of species.

1341
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I count a little and get a little species.

1342
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I see.

1343
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Thank you.

1344
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Let me explain

1345
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
why I ask this question.

1346
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
A while ago,

1347
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I went to see

1348
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
a group of researchers.

1349
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They were doing

1350
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
microscopic sampling.

1351
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
They said

1352
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it was hard

1353
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
to calculate

1354
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
the number of species

1355
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
with human eyes.

1356
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
If you know

1357
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
the statistical error,

1358
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
you can calculate

1359
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
the number of species.

1360
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
They developed a

1361
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
video recognition method

1362
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
to calculate

1363
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the number of species.

1364
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
They immediately reduced

1365
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
the error.

1366
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I was wondering

1367
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
if you could apply this technology.

1368
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You said you counted

1369
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
tens of thousands of species.

1370
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
The statistical error of tens of thousands

1371
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
is about 1%.

1372
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The width of the distribution

1373
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
is more than 1%.

1374
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
This means

1375
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
the dominant bias

1376
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
is different by region

1377
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and year.

1378
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It doesn't help you much.

1379
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I was wondering

1380
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
if we could apply

1381
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
a better method

1382
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
of sampling.

1383
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You said

1384
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
this method

1385
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
was like

1386
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
a machine

1387
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
doing it for me.

1388
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
If I look at it

1389
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
with my eyes,

1390
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I need to look at

1391
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
1 liter of water.

1392
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
But this machine

1393
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
is like a microscope

1394
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
taking photos of me.

1395
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It keeps taking photos.

1396
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I can adjust the flow rate

1397
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and how fast or slow it is.

1398
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's a bit like

1399
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the technique you mentioned.

1400
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
This software is a bit like

1401
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
the technique you mentioned.

1402
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It helps me expand my sample size.

1403
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Okay.

1404
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
That makes sense.

1405
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The problem I encountered

1406
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
in this field

1407
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
is that

1408
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I can build

1409
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
these curves

1410
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and detect these signals.

1411
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I have more than 1,000 data.

1412
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But when I

1413
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
need to measure these feeding needs,

1414
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
because I'm alone,

1415
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I can only measure

1416
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
up to 40 data points.

1417
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
The problem I encountered

1418
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
is that the machine exists,

1419
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
but the distribution

1420
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
is zero.

1421
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So

1422
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
it's a lot of trouble.

1423
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I see. So you really need

1424
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
a lot of statistics.

1425
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm willing to

1426
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
do research

1427
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
in the wild.

1428
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I see. Thank you.

1429
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Thank you.

1430
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Any other

1431
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
questions?

1432
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
If not,

1433
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
let's give a round of applause

1434
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
to thank Zhang Fengxun

1435
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
for his wonderful presentation.

1436
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Thank you.

1437
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Thank you, everyone.

1438
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
This is the end of

1439
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
the webinar.

1440
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
The video will be uploaded

1441
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
next week.

1442
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
If you are interested

1443
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
in more details,

1444
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
or would like to contact

1445
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Zhang Fengxun

1446
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
for a more in-depth discussion,

1447
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
please do so.

1448
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Thank you.
