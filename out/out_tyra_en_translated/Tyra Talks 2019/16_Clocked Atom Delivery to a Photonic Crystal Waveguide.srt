00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone. Good evening. Welcome to today's Tower Talk.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today, we are very honored to have our speaker, Lucas Peng,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
to talk to us about this. Basically, he just graduated from his doctorate thesis.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Clocked atom delivery to a photonic crystal waveguide.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And then there's the simulation part, and then there's the experimental part.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And then he used to be in the Kimball Group at the California Institute of Technology, doing quantum optics.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So let me introduce the background of Lucas Peng.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wait a minute, I'll turn it off.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lucas Peng's doctoral research is mainly focused on the quantum simulation platform by trapping atoms close to the surface of photonic crystal waveguide.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And then after he got his doctorate, he went to a company in North Carolina called AO Sensing,

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
which is currently developing quantum sensing technology.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Lucas Peng is actually a senior at the California Institute of Technology.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He was originally a biophysicist at the University of Taiwan.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And then after graduation, he went to Caltech and got his doctorate.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And now he's in North Carolina.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's going to talk to us about the topic I just talked about.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Otherwise, our speakers won't be able to hear you.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So let's applaud and welcome Lucas Peng to give us today's speech.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, you can start.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhang, for giving me the opportunity to share my research.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you have any questions during my presentation, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The topic I'm going to talk about today is my Ph.D. research.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's mainly about how to put color atoms near the photonic crystal waveguide.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The main purpose is that if you can successfully capture the atoms near the photonic crystal waveguide,

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
you can use it as a quantum simulation platform.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
First, I'm going to talk about our experimental system.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is the transparent photonic crystal waveguide.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The atoms are trapped in the gap between the two waveguides.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So let me first explain why this system is different from other systems,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
such as nanofiber or cavity QED.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What's the difference? What's the advantage?

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And of course, what challenges will it bring?

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Next, I'm going to introduce a simulation program I developed.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It simulates how atoms move near the photonic crystal waveguide.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And it calculates a 2D spectrum using these simulations.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
After getting this spectrum, we can understand the behavior of atoms near the waveguide.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Finally, it will show some experiment results and compare them with the simulation results.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then we can see what conclusions we can get from it.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
First of all, the purpose of this research is to achieve a very strong interaction between light and atoms.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why is this important?

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In the study of quantum technology, such as quantum mechanics or quantum information,

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
we usually use light to transmit quantum information.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
When the quantum information is transmitted, we hope it will be transferred to another system.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because these systems have a longer lifetime,

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the quantum information can be kept longer to do more processing.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
In the field of ML, one of the research directions is to transfer quantum information from light to atoms.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
To do this, we need a very strong interaction between light and atoms.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Of course, the simplest way is to focus light on a very small area,

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which is about a wavelength.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Then put an atom in the focal length to interact with light and atoms.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The limitation of this method is that the area of light is ultimately limited by the wavelength.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In this way, the probability of interaction between light and atoms is very low.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How to make this probability higher?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
One way is to put the atom in a cavity.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can imagine that the light is reflected in the cavity.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Every time the light passes through the atom, it will have one more chance to interact with the atom.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
In this way, the probability of interaction between light and atoms can be greatly increased.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In addition to using a cavity, you can also use a resonator structure like this microtoray.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In fact, it is a bit like a cavity.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The light will keep circling in this circle.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Every time the light passes through the atom, it will have one more chance to interact with the atom.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Another way is to increase the number of atoms.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
For example, the Rieper atom.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
As long as one of the atoms interacts with the light,

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it will move to a high quantum number state.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In this way, it can block other atoms and continue to interact with the light.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So it seems that one atom can be equivalent to a huge atom.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What I just said is that the light is reflected back and forth in the cavity.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Another way is to imagine that the cavity changes the density of light.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So the atoms can have more states to interact with.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is another way to look at it.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
In addition to the cavity QED, there is another system called waveguide QED.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The waveguide QED is a model that can be seen as a very thin fiber and an atom.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When the light moves in this fiber,

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you can imagine that it has an input capacitor,

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
a transmittance and a reflection capacitor.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can calculate the reflection formula of this system.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The most important number in it is gamma1d.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Gamma1d is the probability that the light will move to the fiber after the atom decays.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Because we want a very strong interaction between light and atoms,

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the higher the probability, the better.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Gamma' is the probability that the light decays to other unnecessary states in space.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The research of strong atom-photon coupling is to make gamma1d higher and better.

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How to make it higher?

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There are several ways to do it.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
One way is to reduce the molar area.

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The smaller the area, the higher the probability of interaction between light and atoms.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Another way is to reduce the proof velocity.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Proof velocity means that the slower the light moves in the fiber,

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the more chance it has to interact with the atoms.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
An important figure of merit is gamma1d to gamma'.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The light decays to the state you want,

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
which is the state in the fiber.

96
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The light decays to the state you want, which is the state in the fiber.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The system we made in the lab is a finite crystal waveguide.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is the difference between a finite crystal waveguide and a normal light fiber?

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The point is that the distance from the light fiber to the atom is limited by the wavelength.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The ratio of gamma1d to gamma' is about 4% in the current experiment.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
90% of the light does not interact with the atom, but only passes through the atom.

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In theory, if the light can be captured very close to the finite crystal waveguide,

103
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
gamma1d over gamma' can be increased to about 20.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In this way, only 0.2% of the light will interact with the atom.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why is gamma1d over gamma' so high?

106
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The reason is that the finite crystal waveguide allows you to control the group velocity.

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
For example, if the light is very close to the finite crystal band edge,

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the group velocity becomes very low.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
For example, in our system, the group velocity can only be 1 tenth of the light.

110
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Another reason is that the finite crystal waveguide can be made into a variety of shapes.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You can design this shape to limit the light in a very small range.

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
For example, the system we use allows the light to be concentrated in the middle gap.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This allows the light to be limited to a smaller area than the wavelength.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This can greatly improve the interaction between light and atoms.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In this system, light is an atom, and it can reflect almost all light.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can imagine it as a quantum mirror.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Waveguide QED, in addition to the finite crystal waveguide called Alligator,

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
also has a variety of applications.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For example, you can extend the heat of the light,

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and it will become a very thin light, the nano fiber.

121
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can also put some trees in it.

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It will form some traps in the environment.

123
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This will capture the atoms around the light.

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Another system, like Huffle's Looking Group,

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
is also a finite crystal waveguide.

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They use an optical tweezer to hold the atom,

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and drag it near the finite crystal waveguide.

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This allows it to interact with the guided mode in the finite crystal waveguide.

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
At Purdue University, they also have a system

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that uses an optical tweezer to capture the atoms

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
near the finite crystal waveguide.

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Another special feature of the finite crystal waveguide is...

133
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
One more question.

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is a general question.

135
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What kind of material do you use for structures like this?

136
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It depends on what kind of waveguide you want to transmit the light.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You want it to be as transparent as possible.

138
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
For example, the CZM waveguide we use is 890nm.

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We use Zirconitride.

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Got it. Thank you.

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So you can choose the material you want based on the wavelength you want.

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For example, we often use Telecom Waveband.

143
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You can also use materials like Silica.

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
A special feature of the waveguide

145
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is that you can design your waveguide

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
to have different wavelengths in different frequencies.

147
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
For example, this is a bandstructure graph.

148
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The horizontal axis is the wave number,

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and the vertical axis is the frequency.

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can see that at this frequency...

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
For example, at a certain frequency, the light can't fall inside.

152
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This is a concept called bandgap.

153
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
At the edge of the bandgap,

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
you can see that the dΩdk is equal to 0.

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This means that the group velocity is very small.

156
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So in this case, the density of states is very high.

157
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So if the frequency of the original wave is around here,

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you can imagine that it can interact with many states.

159
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This can greatly increase the probability of decaying to the state.

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So we usually design the FWG to have a bandgap

161
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that is very close to the original wavelength.

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So you can imagine that the dΩdk can be outside the bandgap,

163
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
or inside the bandgap.

164
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The first case is that when the dΩdk is outside the bandgap,

165
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you can see that this frequency can be transmitted in the waveguide.

166
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
For example, when the original wave goes from GF to GF,

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
it emits a light.

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This light is at the frequency that can be transmitted,

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
so it will move on the waveguide.

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So you can imagine that the interaction between the atoms on the waveguide is as strong.

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is a region.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Another region is that if you put the frequency of the atom's wavelength into the bandgap,

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
because the light of this frequency cannot be transmitted inside the waveguide,

174
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
it will form an exponential decay light cloud near the atom.

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So it's more interesting at this time.

176
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The farther the atoms are, the lower their interaction.

177
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The closer the atoms are, the longer the interaction.

178
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So you can imagine that this can have some local interaction.

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Next, I will explain how to control the two atoms in this region

180
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to produce a convenient interaction.

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So in theory, as long as you have a one-dimensional system,

182
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you can let the atoms produce a Hamiltonian that can be engineered conveniently.

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's start with a simple example outside the waveguide.

184
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is an experiment we did in our lab in 2015.

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The way to do this experiment is to use a laser beam to shine on the waveguide.

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It will form such an interference pattern.

187
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You can see that the interference pattern has some intensity maxima here and here.

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We call it Z1, Z2.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If the laser frequency is slightly lower than the intensity of the atom,

190
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
it will attract the atoms to the intensity maxima.

191
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
By this way, we will catch some atoms near the front crystal waveguide.

192
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This place is above the waveguide, so it's not in the middle of the waveguide.

193
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So in this place, γ1d over γ' is about 2.

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This means that when it decays, the probability of it decaying to the waveguide is 2 times higher than the probability of it decaying to the vacuum.

195
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What's interesting about this is that if the atoms are periodically caught on the front crystal waveguide,

196
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
if the interference between them is the wavelength of the vacuum,

197
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,000
an atom can interact with the entire collective state of the atom.

198
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In this way, the interaction will enhance the number of atoms.

199
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
For example, if you have nA atoms, the interaction between them will increase nA times.

200
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But the number of atoms decays to free space is the same.

201
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So the more atoms you have, the more likely it is to decay to the waveguide.

202
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is a phenomenon similar to superradiance.

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
In this experiment, the number of atoms is used to control how long you have been caught.

204
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The longer you have been caught, the more likely the atom will escape your trap.

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So here you can see that when the atom is caught, the decay speed is very fast.

206
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
When you let it go for a long time, the decay speed drops.

207
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We can see that when the number of atoms increases, the interaction between it and the state of the waveguide increases.

208
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You can do the same experiment in the same way.

209
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But this time we can adjust the bandage of the waveguide to the outside of the atom.

210
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Although the wavelength frequency of the atom is inside the bandgap.

211
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
At this time, you can see that there are two traces here.

212
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The green trace describes the intensity of the photon decay to the waveguide.

213
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The blue trace measures how long the interaction between the atoms is.

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The intensity of this interaction can be determined by the symmetry of the measured spectrum.

215
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If the interaction is stronger, the spectrum will not be symmetrical.

216
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So you can measure how strong the interaction between the atoms is.

217
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You can see that when the wavelength frequency of the atom enters the bandgap,

218
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The photon does not decay to the waveguide.

219
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But the interaction between the atoms is still greater than the probability of the photon decaying to the waveguide.

220
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This means that in the bandgap region, the photon is still a potential decay cloud.

221
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Next, if you can put the atoms in the waveguide and form a string,

222
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You can add a magnetic field to make each atom's Zeeman state different.

223
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
For example, you can use an extra laser beam to add a sideband.

224
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The sideband can match the difference in the frequency of the Zeeman state between the atoms.

225
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Then you can engineer the interaction between two random atoms.

226
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
For example, the system here has a one-dimensional atom array.

227
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
There are interactions between the two arrays.

228
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The interaction between the rightmost and the leftmost sideband can be simulated.

229
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It is a circular system.

230
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Excuse me, can I go back to the page?

231
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't quite understand.

232
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wait a minute, I don't quite understand.

233
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You said two interactions.

234
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why does it become a circle?

235
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It doesn't overlap the last two interactions.

236
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
For example, when you want to make two atoms interact,

237
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You have to let...

238
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Take a look at this state first.

239
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There are three states in this atom.

240
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There are two ground states and one excited state.

241
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, I know what's up there.

242
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, no, it's okay, I saw it.

243
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Because my idea is,

244
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't you all interact with the neighbors?

245
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How did it become a periodic boundary condition?

246
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's how it becomes a circle.

247
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're right.

248
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The beginning and the end also interact.

249
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes, but it doesn't necessarily only interact with the neighbors.

250
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Does it interact?

251
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It depends on the frequency of your guiding mode.

252
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Does it resonate with the frequency of your other state?

253
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You can imagine that you can add a magnetic field.

254
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's a gradient magnetic field.

255
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let every atom's Zeeman state have a slightly different frequency.

256
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So basically, you can just pick it up.

257
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You don't have to...

258
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You can use an extra laser frequency to pick up the two atoms.

259
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, okay, okay, I see.

260
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hello, can I ask a question?

261
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Is this similar to gradient echo memory?

262
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a bit like spin echo.

263
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Gn, gradient echo memory, is a magnetic field that slowly increases.

264
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Then every connection will have a slightly different splitting.

265
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, it's a bit like this.

266
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Is there a difference between the two?

267
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who has the advantage?

268
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I should say...

269
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I just said that using a strong magnetic field to create a difference.

270
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But you don't have to use a magnetic field.

271
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You can use the AC source shape to let each state have a different frequency.

272
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
In this case, you don't necessarily need a gradient.

273
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You can have a laser for each atom to generate different shapes.

274
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Okay, thank you.

275
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Next, I will introduce the Delegator Functional Crystal Waveguide we use.

276
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This is what the whole system looks like.

277
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
First of all, the whole system is hanging on the window in the middle of the chip.

278
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The way we interact with the waveguide is mainly through the light.

279
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The light is stuck to the chip.

280
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Then it can be coupled with the waveguide.

281
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can see that there are many other structures on the waveguide.

282
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
For example, there is a coupler here.

283
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Then there are some mechanical structures here.

284
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The purpose of the coupler is to pull the device so that the two beams in the middle do not stick together.

285
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So this angle is optimized so that the center of the waveguide can maintain the gap.

286
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
In addition, these structures are responsible for the heat generated by the laser.

287
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You will find that even if you only input a few microwave lasers,

288
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Because the whole structure is very small, it will become very hot.

289
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is a device, SEM.

290
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But you don't do active cooling, do you?

291
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You just do it in the light.

292
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
In fact, we still have to heat it up.

293
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Because we can't cool it down.

294
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So sometimes you adjust the frequency to heat it up.

295
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
After heating it up, you can change its bandage.

296
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So you don't just do it, but you don't want active cooling.

297
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's not that you can't do it, but we don't do active cooling.

298
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And there's a bad thing about being too cold.

299
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If you're cold, your laser will stick to it.

300
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So sometimes you want it to get hotter and hotter.

301
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Excuse me.

302
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Thank you.

303
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You said your structure is about a few hundred nanometers.

304
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Then you said you need to use fiber.

305
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Is it because this structure is very small?

306
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You need to use evanescent wave to go in.

307
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
With the effect of atoms.

308
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yes.

309
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Because in the end you want to send the light to the waveguide.

310
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So the way we use it is to put...

311
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You can see it on this side.

312
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
We stick the fiber to the chip.

313
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Align it with the waveguide.

314
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I was surprised at first.

315
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You think the fiber is big.

316
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The waveguide is only a few hundred nanometers.

317
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You think its mode doesn't match.

318
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But if you calculate the waveguide's mode.

319
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You find that the fiber's mode matches 90%.

320
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,000
In fact, about 50% of the light can be sent to the waveguide.

321
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Is the light coming from the evanescent wave?

322
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Or is it a normal wave transmitted?

323
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Because it's single-mode fiber.

324
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's like a mode built in fiber.

325
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It just came out and it's directly on the waveguide's mode.

326
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So as long as its mode is matched, it can continue to pass through the waveguide.

327
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's not an evanescent wave.

328
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But it's not a Gaussian beam.

329
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's a single-mode fiber in the waveguide.

330
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The mode depends on the gradient of the evanescent wave.

331
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is an experiment photo.

332
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We stick the light on the chip.

333
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Mount it on a viewport.

334
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Then install the viewport into the vacuum chamber.

335
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Let me briefly explain the CZM's energy level.

336
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The CZM's fine structure uses 6S and 6P states.

337
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
6S is the ground state.

338
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
6P is the fine structure.

339
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Because of the spin-orbit coupling, there are two different connections.

340
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
If you consider the hyperfine structure,

341
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
it's because of the nuclear spin and the electron spin.

342
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The ground state is subdivided into Fn3 and Fn4.

343
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The 6P state can also be divided into two connections.

344
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The upper one is divided into four connections.

345
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The lower frequency is called D1.

346
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The higher frequency is called D2.

347
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The design of the finite crystal waveguide allows D1 to correspond to a band edge.

348
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
D2 corresponds to another band edge.

349
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You can imagine a simple idea.

350
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You use a band edge frequency, D1, to capture the atom.

351
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You use another frequency, D2, to trap the atom.

352
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
For example, if you put D2's laser into the waveguide,

353
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and make it slightly blue detuned,

354
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
the atom will be pushed to the intensity minima.

355
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The atom will be trapped to the thickest point.

356
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You can use another band edge frequency, D1, to probe the atom.

357
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Because D1 is another band edge,

358
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
the intensity will be stronger at the thickest point.

359
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
In this case, you can use one frequency to capture,

360
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and another frequency to detect the atom.

361
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Of course, this is a simplified model.

362
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
There will be more details in the introduction.

363
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The main purpose of our experiment is to capture the atom in the finite crystal gap.

364
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And we hope that each size can capture an atom.

365
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If you can do this,

366
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
you can think about promoting it to more complex systems,

367
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
such as binary finite crystal.

368
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Here is a brief description of the basic atom cooling and capturing techniques used in the experiment.

369
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The methods used are MOP,

370
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Dipole Trap,

371
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Optical Lattice,

372
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and a cooling technique called Degenerate Raman Side-In Cooling.

373
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
MOP is a method of surrounding the atom group.

374
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
There are six lasers in total.

375
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You can imagine that it is like a Doppler cooling in every direction.

376
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The atom going down will be absorbed by the light

377
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and released from the inside,

378
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
so it will get a momentum kick,

379
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and it will be cooled.

380
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The purpose of adding this magnetic field is to introduce a space-dependent shift

381
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
to generate confinement.

382
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
If you have confinement and cooling,

383
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
you can make a MOP.

384
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Another concept is Optical Dipole Trap.

385
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
As I just explained,

386
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
if the frequency of the laser is slightly lower than the frequency of the atomic moon,

387
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
it will produce a shift to your connection.

388
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
In this case,

389
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the ground state will shift down,

390
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and the excited state will shift up.

391
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You can see that in the ground state atom,

392
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
it will produce a space-dependent potential.

393
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
At this time, the frequency of the atomic moon can also change.

394
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I will talk about how to help us understand where the atom is in space.

395
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
For example, if the frequency of the laser is slightly lower than the frequency of the atomic moon,

396
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the atom will be sucked into the Intensity Maxima.

397
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
If the light is Blue Detuned,

398
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
the atom will be blown away by the Intensity Maxima.

399
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So if there is Intensity Minima in your potential,

400
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
the atom will be gathered in that place.

401
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
There are different configurations.

402
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The simplest is Gaussian Beam.

403
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It can produce a trap.

404
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
In the lab, we use two lasers to form a standing wave.

405
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
At this time, the atom can be captured in the standing wave.

406
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It looks like a lattice.

407
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
This is called Optical Lattice.

408
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
After the atom is caught in the Optical Lattice,

409
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
we still need to cool it.

410
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The cooling method we use here is called Degenerate Raman Sibon Cooling.

411
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
This is a very ingenious way.

412
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The way is that you can add a magnetic field

413
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
to produce a little change in the connection between atoms in different MF states.

414
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
If the difference in energy between each MF state

415
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
is just equal to the energy of the H-bar omega

416
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
that vibrates in your Optical Lattice,

417
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
you can see that the vibrating state of under 1

418
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
is the same energy as the under 0 state of the next MF state.

419
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
At this time, you can use the Raman Transition method

420
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
to transfer the atom from n equals 1 to the under 0 state

421
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and then pump it back.

422
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
After this cycle,

423
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
the atom can reduce the vibration frame.

424
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
By repeating this process,

425
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
in theory, you can cool the atom

426
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to the vibration state in your trap.

427
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
By doing this,

428
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
we can cool the atom in the Optical Lattice.

429
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Once the atom is trapped in the Optical Lattice,

430
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
the way we experiment here is to move the Optical Lattice.

431
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
As long as you change one of the laser frequencies,

432
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
the entire interference pattern will start to move.

433
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We can use this method to let the atom pass through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

434
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The purpose is that

435
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
each piece of the Optical Lattice's MF

436
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
is called a pancake.

437
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
For example, there are 500 atoms in it.

438
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Of these 500 atoms,

439
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
only a small part will interact with the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

440
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
But in the experiment cycle,

441
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
there are 2000 pancakes passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

442
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Through this method,

443
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
we can try to let more atoms interact with the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

444
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
This is a simple picture of our experiment.

445
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
First, we make a MOD of the atom in the Source Chamber.

446
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Then we use a laser to kick it into another MOD in the main chamber.

447
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Then we cool the atom in the MOD

448
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
and trap it in the Optical Lattice.

449
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The Optical Lattice is a beam of two lasers.

450
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Once the atom is caught in the Optical Lattice,

451
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
we change the frequency of one of the lasers

452
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and move the atom near the device.

453
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
When the atom is near the device,

454
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
we can put a few beams into the waveguide.

455
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
One of the beams is a Probe Laser.

456
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
This laser adjusts the frequency of D1 of the DZM.

457
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
If the atom is near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy,

458
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
it will absorb the light of the Probe.

459
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We can use the amount of Probe through the waveguide

460
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
to measure how many atoms interact with the waveguide.

461
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We can also put various trapped potentials into the waveguide.

462
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Another important component is that

463
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
when the Optical Lattice passes through the waveguide,

464
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
some light will be emitted into the waveguide.

465
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
We can also detect the light emitted by the Optical Lattice.

466
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Through this light, we can know which part of the Optical Lattice is passing through the waveguide.

467
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Is it passing through the waveguide at the peak?

468
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Or is it passing through the waveguide at the valley?

469
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Through this, we can have more data to understand

470
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
how the atom moves near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

471
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
This is an experimental result.

472
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
We can see that the atom passes through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy at T20.

473
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
The horizontal axis is the time,

474
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and the vertical axis is the frequency of the Probe Beam.

475
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We can turn the Probe Beam from negative 50 MHz to positive 50 MHz detuning.

476
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The atom passes through the waveguide at T20.

477
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
This is the data from one of the photodials.

478
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
The photodial specifically detects the light emitted by the Optical Lattice.

479
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
When the atom passes through, it generates a periodic signal.

480
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The frequency of this signal depends on how fast the Optical Lattice passes through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

481
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,000
For example, we are using a frequency of about 1.2 MHz to move the Optical Lattice.

482
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
The signal is 1.2 MHz.

483
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Through this signal, we can know what time the atom is passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

484
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Note that the time scale here is microsecond.

485
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The time scale on the right is millisecond.

486
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So there are thousands of Optical Lattice pancakes passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy in these two Blobs.

487
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Do you know the number of atoms in each Blob?

488
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We can know how many atoms are near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

489
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,000
At any time, there may be one or two atoms passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

490
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,000
We estimate that each pancake will have one atom passing through the gap of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

491
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
This is where we really want to catch the atoms.

492
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The reason why we use Optical Lattice is to get a cycle.

493
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
For example, each pancake can catch one atom in the gap.

494
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
If 100 pancakes pass through the gap, we can catch 100 atoms.

495
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
The purpose of this experiment is to find a trapping cycle.

496
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So that each Optical Lattice cycle can catch one atom.

497
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Of course, we haven't reached this goal yet.

498
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But my PhD research is moving in this direction.

499
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We just saw that the setup of the experiment can produce such an experiment result.

500
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
How do we interpret this experiment result?

501
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Through simulation, we can help us understand how these atomic trajectories correspond to the experimental results we get.

502
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
This simulation is a Monte Carlo simulation.

503
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
The atoms are scattered in the Optical Lattice.

504
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They are then formalized and moved to the vicinity of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

505
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
According to the Optical Dipole Potential, each atom moves.

506
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Finally, we collect these trajectories and calculate the spectrum we should get.

507
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The concept of simulation is very complicated.

508
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But there are some challenges in practice.

509
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Because it is a periodic potential,

510
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
you need to measure a large area for the atoms to formalize in this potential.

511
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
For example, our simulation domain is a few tens of microns.

512
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But the Phonar Crystal is a very small device.

513
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Its size is a few hundred nanometers to a micron.

514
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So the whole experiment is very memory-intensive.

515
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So most of the time, it is optimized to use as little data as possible.

516
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The concept of simulation is to let the atoms simulate how they move from a faraway place to the vicinity of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

517
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Then simulate various Optical Dipole Force and Probing Beam Profile to calculate the spectrum you will get.

518
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You can also do 3D simulation.

519
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
For example, this is a simulation result.

520
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You can see the lines here are the atomic trajectories.

521
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The atomic trajectories can be subdivided into different types of trajectories.

522
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
For example, these green trajectories are the gaps in the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

523
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
These are the atoms we are most interested in.

524
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The other blue trajectories are the ones that go around the outside of the device.

525
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The red ones are the ones that hit the surface of the device.

526
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Next, we're going to use these trajectories to calculate a spectrum.

527
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
How do you calculate the spectrum?

528
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You can distribute the atomic trajectories to the top of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

529
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
For example, there are a few atoms here.

530
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You can use a matrix to represent each segment of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.

531
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This matrix is called the transfer matrix.

532
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The Phonar Crystal Lake guy has its own transfer matrix.

533
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Each atom has its own transfer matrix.

534
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The transfer matrix of the atoms depends on the location of the atoms.

535
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We can see that the Gamma 1D is determined by the strength of the probe at that location.

536
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The distance between the atoms near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy determines the strength of the Gamma 1D.

537
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The transfer matrix of each atom is different.

538
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
If we multiply all these matrices, we get the total transfer matrix.

539
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
From there, we can get the transmission and reflection of the entire system.

540
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Next, let's see what the simulation results will be.

541
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I just explained how to get the atomic trajectories through simulation.

542
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Next, I will explain how to connect the results of our experiment through simulation.

543
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Here is a tool we use.

544
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
We call it the Clock Spectrum.

545
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Why is it called Clock?

546
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Because our apical lattice sends the atoms near the device.

547
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The atoms are cyclically sent near the Phonar Crystal.

548
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
For example, if your chirping frequency is 1MHz, each micron will have an atom passing through.

549
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Theoretically, you can get a cyclic signal.

550
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The cyclic signal depends on the frequency of the atoms coming to your device.

551
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
For example, if we look at the light coming out of the probe and make it into a histogram,

552
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:31,000
we can see that the frequency of the apical lattice is a cyclic signal.

553
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We can also detect the apical lattice signal through another photodiode.

554
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This gives us a clock so that we can know which part of the apical lattice is passing through our waveguide.

555
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:01,000
If you fold the signals of each microsecond into an apical lattice period, you can get a histogram.

556
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The histogram tells you how many atoms are interacting with the device at different times in the apical lattice frequency.

557
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
If you do this experiment for each detuning, you can get a two-dimensional spectrum.

558
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:38,000
In this two-dimensional picture, the horizontal axis is the time, and the vertical axis is the probe detuning.

559
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
This two-dimensional spectrum can convey some information about the atoms moving near the Phonar Crystal waveguide.

560
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
The next step is to find out how to match the atomic trajectory to the two-dimensional spectrum.

561
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There are different modes for this experiment.

562
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,000
As mentioned earlier, we let the bandage correspond to the transition of C-joint D1 and D2.

563
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Another mode is polarization.

564
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,000
As mentioned earlier, the bandage corresponds to when the polarization is parallel to the waveguide.

565
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
If it is perpendicular, there will be another bandgap.

566
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
However, this bandgap is far from the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2.

567
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So for this proof, the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.

568
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Here you can see TE mode.

569
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
D1 and D2 are bandage modes.

570
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The frequency of D1 and D2 has a very obvious x-direction structure.

571
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
For example, D2's intensity is concentrated in the thin part.

572
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
D1's intensity is concentrated in the thick part.

573
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We mainly use these two modes to probe and capture the atoms.

574
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
TE mode, you can see that it is almost uniform in the direction of the waveguide.

575
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
TE mode, you can see that it is almost uniform in the direction of the waveguide.

576
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Because the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is far from the TEM bandgap,

577
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.

578
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.

579
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
This mode is different in that its intensity is the strongest above and below the waveguide.

580
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So it has a very useful feature that can help us protect the surface of the device.

581
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
If you let it be a blue-D-chain, it can bounce away the atoms near it,

582
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
so that it won't stick to the surface of the device.

583
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
At the same time, it can produce a large A-structure inside the gap and outside the gap,

584
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
so that we can detect how many atoms pass through the gap.

585
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
This is a detail.

586
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
We just said that using a mode to do trapping is actually a simplification.

587
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
We need to combine two modes to produce a stable trap on the three-dimensional surface.

588
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
We need to combine two modes to produce a stable trap on the three-dimensional surface.

589
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
There is another interesting challenge.

590
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We found that to produce a trap, the energy of two modes must have a ratio.

591
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
If there is no ratio, the trap will not be a stable trap.

592
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But there is a problem.

593
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The intensity of different frequencies coupled to the waveguide is different.

594
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So we can't directly measure how much light is in the waveguide.

595
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So how do we know the intensity ratio of two modes?

596
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
By combining the experiment results and simulation results,

597
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
we can know how strong the light in the waveguide is.

598
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Another purpose of the experiment is to tell us the timing.

599
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Here is a way of trapping.

600
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
When the atom enters the middle of the waveguide,

601
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
for example, it is in the state f4.

602
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
When the atom is in the middle, we pump it to the excited state at the right time.

603
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
When the atom is in the middle, we pump it to the excited state at the right time.

604
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
We can see that the atom is pumped from a light potential to a deep potential.

605
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
At this time, the atom can be trapped.

606
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Otherwise, the atom will come in and go out again.

607
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Because this is a conservative potential.

608
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
To get this result, we need to know the time of the atom passing the gap.

609
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The same simulation can tell us the time of the atom passing the gap.

610
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Let's look at this first.

611
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I have a question.

612
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Does your simulation include interference?

613
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
For example, environmental, thermal, radiation, etc.

614
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Because I don't know what is the background interference of Dominant.

615
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Does it include?

616
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Thermal radiation, compared to other modes,

617
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
For example, the strength of the output lattice is hundreds of milliwatts.

618
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
The Guided Mode contains several microwatts.

619
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Their intensity is much greater than thermal radiation.

620
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So we don't need to consider thermal radiation.

621
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Is there any other known interference that needs to be considered?

622
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
There is one.

623
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It can't be classified as interference.

624
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
This is a big factor.

625
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Casper-Poller force.

626
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The atom is very close to the attraction force.

627
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
If you don't consider the attraction force, the result will be quite different.

628
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I didn't think of it at first.

629
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But later I found it to be a very important factor.

630
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I see. Thank you.

631
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
There are some interference factors.

632
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
For example, the vibration of the device.

633
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We can think of it as a suspension line.

634
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
If it heats up, it may vibrate.

635
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
We have measured the frequency of its vibration.

636
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I found that it is much greater than the frequency of the atom vibrating in the trap.

637
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So we don't need to consider it for the time being.

638
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Let's explain how to calibrate these three different modes.

639
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I want to introduce a simple question first.

640
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
The question is how to calibrate the optical lattice beam.

641
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
This is not a calibration.

642
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Because we already know how strong the optical lattice beam is.

643
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's just a way to verify that this is a feasible method.

644
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
This is a simulation result.

645
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The density of the atom here is much greater than the real density.

646
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
The real density is only about one-tenth.

647
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
This simulation result can let us know how the atom moves near the device.

648
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The potentials used in this simulation are two optical lattices and the Kessler-Potter force I just mentioned.

649
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
The atom will be attracted when it is very close to the device.

650
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The attraction is the blue potential around it.

651
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It is a very strong potential.

652
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
On the right, we can see the simulated clock spectrum.

653
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The atom is attracted by the optical lattice.

654
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So it's not coming one by one.

655
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We can think of it as passing through the final crystal.

656
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It will cause the biggest absorption.

657
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's not zero detuning.

658
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Because the optical lattice is red detuning.

659
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So it brings a blue detuning.

660
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
As mentioned before, the red detuning potential will reduce the ground state.

661
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But the excited state will be higher.

662
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So the overall frequency will also increase.

663
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So we can see that the frequency of the atomic transition is a positive detuning.

664
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Here we can see that it's going down.

665
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
This is a phenomenon caused by the Kessler-Potter potential.

666
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
The Kessler-Potter potential is also an attractive potential.

667
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:51,000
If the excited state doesn't change, the frequency of the atomic transition will also increase.

668
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So it's a red detuning.

669
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The reason is that the Kessler-Potter potential affects the excited state.

670
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
For the cesium D1 transition,

671
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
the change in the excited state is actually twice the ground state.

672
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So the decrease in the excited state is actually twice as much as the decrease in the ground state.

673
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So in fact, the frequency of the atomic transition is getting smaller.

674
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So under the influence of the Kessler-Potter potential, the detuning is negative.

675
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
We can see that the left is the result of the experiment.

676
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So we find that the two are actually quite matched.

677
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And the size of the detuning is the same.

678
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This means that the parameters of the simulation and the experiment are the same.

679
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
At this time, we can measure something we don't know.

680
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
For example, we can measure the length of the TM guided mode.

681
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
This is a simulation of the TM guided mode.

682
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
The TM guided mode is a blue detuning.

683
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
So it generates a negative Kessler-Potter potential above and below the waveguide.

684
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So we can see that the atoms are ejected by the Kessler-Potter potential.

685
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
At the same time, it changes the direction of the atoms entering the gap.

686
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
The picture on the right is a comparison of the simulation and the experiment.

687
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
We can see that the simulation of the two-dimensional surface is actually very similar.

688
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So their differences are not detailed.

689
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
However, we can see that the simulation and the experiment are very similar.

690
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
We can see that after adding this potential,

691
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
it has some impact on the two-dimensional Kessler-Potter potential.

692
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
The biggest impact is that you can see that it generates a feature that goes down.

693
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:54,000
This feature is caused by the difference in time when the atoms are ejected by the Kessler-Potter potential.

694
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Now we can compare the light energy of the experiment with the simulation.

695
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
We can see that the light intensity of the simulation is actually less.

696
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,000
This is because the light intensity measured in the experiment is the light intensity in the fiber.

697
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
The light intensity in the waveguide is actually much less.

698
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:33,000
So we can estimate that the fiber coupling efficiency is about 30%.

699
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The efficiency is the same as measured in other ways.

700
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
In this way, we can directly measure the intensity of the light energy in the device.

701
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
What kind of trajectory does this feature correspond to?

702
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We can see that the blue feature corresponds to the blue trajectory on the right.

703
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,000
They are outside the device, so they see less guided modes and receive less AC short-circuits.

704
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
The trajectory that climbs up is the blue guided mode,

705
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:24,000
so it sees a longer value chain, and the frequency is getting lower and lower.

706
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:34,000
In the middle gap, the AC short-circuit corresponds to the green result.

707
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:44,000
We can see that we can use this method to know the time and location of the atoms near the device.

708
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,000
There are about 100 ns time resolution and 50 ns space resolution.

709
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
We can use the same method to do TMO.

710
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
We can see that it matches quite well.

711
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Interestingly, we found that the intensity of the energy in the device is much more than what we put into the experiment.

712
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But this is not surprising, because we are using TEMO.

713
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
TEMO's D1 detour is on the band edge.

714
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Because the band edge's group velocity becomes smaller,

715
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
the intensity of the light inside will be enhanced.

716
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
The intensity of the light inside the VGAI is greater than what we put into the experiment.

717
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
This tells us that there is a slow light effect.

718
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
As I said, there are different types of trajectories.

719
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
We can separate them in the simulation to see what each of them contributes to the flux vector.

720
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
For example, the contribution caused by the middle atom,

721
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
the contribution caused by the outer atom, and the contribution caused by the other blue atoms.

722
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
This is a very important feature.

723
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This is a very important feature.

724
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It tells us if there is really an atom passing through the gap.

725
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Because this is the atom we want to capture.

726
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So we want to know if there is really an atom passing through the gap.

727
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
We can find that if we take a cut at this time,

728
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
you will find that there are two dips.

729
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
The simulation tells us that one of the dips mainly comes from the contribution of the middle atom.

730
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
The other dip is the contribution of other atoms.

731
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So we can observe that there are two dips at this time in the experiment.

732
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So it can tell us that there are indeed atoms passing through the gap in the middle.

733
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
By comparing the simulation results,

734
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
we can estimate that each pancake will have one or two atoms passing through the gap.

735
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
At the same time, the simulation also tells us

736
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
when to pump the atom into the deeper trap.

737
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
The position of the dip tells us the AC structure over there.

738
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So it tells us what frequency of the laser should pump the atom into the deeper trap.

739
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
By comparing the simulation and the experiment,

740
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
First, we can calibrate the strength of the guided mode to create the trap we want.

741
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Second, it tells us when to pump the atom.

742
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Third, it tells us what detuning to use to pump the atom into the trap.

743
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Finally, let's talk about the more unexpected result.

744
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
We can probe how strong the Kasper-Potter force is.

745
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
For example, there are two simulations.

746
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
The right one has no Kasper-Potter force.

747
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
The left one has Kasper-Potter force.

748
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,000
The difference is that there is a feature that goes down here.

749
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We found that this feature does appear in the experiment.

750
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
By comparing the two features,

751
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
we can get the Kasper-Potter potential.

752
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The potential coefficient is the same as mentioned in the simulation.

753
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Finally, let's talk about the new research I did when I left.

754
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
A new way to put the chip into the vacuum chamber is very troublesome.

755
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You have to stick 16 fibers to the U-Port and then put it into the chamber.

756
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It usually takes us two days.

757
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
The new generation of experiments does not require light.

758
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You can directly focus the laser on the coupler with the microscope objective.

759
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
You can directly couple from the vacuum chamber to the waveguide.

760
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
This can greatly reduce the time it takes to replace the chip.

761
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It also provides more optical access.

762
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
We can put more beams and have closer observation.

763
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Another way is that we can use optical tweezers instead of optical lasers.

764
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
The advantage of optical lasers is that it gives us a lot of atoms in a short time.

765
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
The advantage of optical lasers is that it gives us a lot of atoms in a short time.

766
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It can extract the information I just mentioned.

767
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
If you want to fine-tune the position of the atoms, you can use optical tweezers.

768
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You can fine-tune the position of the atoms on the one-dimensional waveguide.

769
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
In this way, you can probe the interaction between two atoms more directly.

770
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
This is a summary of the applications of the two-dimensional waveguide.

771
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
This is a summary of the two-dimensional waveguide.

772
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
First, I talked about why we want to do Strong Atom Photon Interaction.

773
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Then, I explained how we send the atoms near the waveguide.

774
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Next, I will introduce a numerical simulation.

775
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
This is a numerical simulation to simulate the trajectory of the atoms.

776
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Then, calculate a two-dimensional spectrum from these trajectories.

777
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Then, calculate a two-dimensional spectrum from these trajectories.

778
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It can help us adjust the strength of the guided mode.

779
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It can help us understand the behavior of the atoms near the waveguide.

780
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
It can help us understand the time and how the neutrino pumps the atoms into the trap.

781
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It can help us understand the attraction force of the atoms near the dielectric.

782
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Thank you.

783
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Thank you, everyone.

784
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Let's applaud to thank our speaker today.

785
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Please turn on the microphone.

786
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Then, we can hear your applause.

787
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Thank you for giving us this wonderful speech.

788
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Next, we are going to have a Q&A.

789
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Before we start, let me advertise something.

and our website.

805
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Now, let's start the Q&A.

806
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Any questions?

807
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I have a question.

808
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
What you just said

809
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
is using Optical Lattice

810
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
to deliver your origin

811
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
to the photonic crystal?

812
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The ultimate goal is to deliver it

813
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
to the gap between the two photonic crystals

814
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and let the origin stay in the gap.

815
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
The current method is...

816
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Is it possible to easily control

817
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
the gap between your lattice

818
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
and the gap between your crystals?

819
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
This is...

820
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
This is Optical Lattice's...

821
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
It consists of two Gaussian beams.

822
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We put the photonic crystal waveguide

823
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
on the position of the Gaussian beam.

824
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The position of the beam

825
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
is about 60 microns.

826
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
The size of the device

827
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
is about 1 microns.

828
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Most of the origin

829
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
does not pass

830
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
near the photonic crystal waveguide.

831
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But when each pan can pass,

832
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
dozens of them

833
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
will appear near the waveguide.

834
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Among those dozens,

835
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
one or two may run into the gap.

836
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I think it can be delivered one-to-one.

837
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
This is very difficult.

838
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Because the gap is 200 nanometers.

839
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The wavelength is not that small.

840
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Even if you can focus on

841
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
the wavelength,

842
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
the Rayleigh Lambda will be very small.

843
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So you can't...

844
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's impossible to load

845
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
such a large mod

846
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
into the Optical Lattice.

847
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
After loading,

848
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
the Rayleigh Lambda is about 2 nanometers.

849
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It takes thousands of pancakes

850
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
to deliver one-to-one.

851
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
If you focus on such a small wavelength,

852
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
it's a bit like

853
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
what I just mentioned,

854
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
the optical tracer.

855
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
The optical tracer focuses on

856
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
the wavelength.

857
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Relatively speaking,

858
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
you can only trap one ray

859
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and put it near the waveguide.

860
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It has its advantages.

861
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
The difficulty is that

862
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
you have to catch a ray

863
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
and move the ray

864
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
to the waveguide.

865
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
You can't lose the ray.

866
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So it's difficult.

867
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Okay, thank you.

868
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I have a question.

869
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I want to ask...

870
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You said your goal is

871
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
to achieve strong

872
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
metroid interaction.

873
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I want to ask

874
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
your long-term goal is

875
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
when you achieve strong interaction,

876
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
what do you want to do with it?

877
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The main goal is

878
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
to simulate

879
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
the system of

880
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
many-body physics.

881
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
In addition to

882
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
the simulation of

883
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
quantum magnetism,

884
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
there is another

885
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
interesting experiment.

886
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
For example,

887
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
the cavity QED

888
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
is a classical object

889
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
with a large diameter.

890
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You can imagine

891
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
if you catch five atoms

892
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and put a side in the middle,

893
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
the middle is an atom again,

894
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and the side is five atoms.

895
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
The five atoms on the left and right

896
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
is like a black mirror.

897
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That means the atom

898
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and the mirror

899
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
are quantum objects.

900
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
This is very interesting.

901
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Through what I said,

902
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
you can create

903
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
pairwise Hamiltonian

904
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
in quantum simulation.

905
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You can create

906
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
various quantum simulations

907
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
in pairwise Hamiltonian.

908
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
There is another interesting

909
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
application that I didn't mention.

910
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
This is different from

911
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
the general waveguide QD,

912
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
because it has a

913
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
dielectric structure.

914
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
This dielectric structure

915
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
forces the intensity of the light

916
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
to stick to the structure.

917
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So you can make

918
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
the distance between the atoms

919
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
smaller than the wavelength

920
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
of free space.

921
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
This is an interesting phenomenon.

922
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
The light radiated

923
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
to the free space

924
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
is interfered by the atoms.

925
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
This can greatly reduce

926
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
the intensity of spontaneous emission.

927
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
This is something

928
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
that general waveguide QD

929
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
can't do.

930
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
If you can

931
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
greatly suppress

932
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
the frequency of decay

933
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
to free space,

934
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
you can make

935
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
a quantum memory system.

936
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Do you have any questions?

937
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
If not,

938
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I have a question.

939
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Can you jump to the

940
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Kashmir Force page?

941
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
You can explain

942
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
what you want to convey

943
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
in this page.

944
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
How do you see this?

945
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
At the beginning of the simulation,

946
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
we didn't add

947
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
the Kashmir Force page.

948
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
You can see that

949
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
this simulation

950
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
is the simplest

951
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
one.

952
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
We didn't add any

953
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
guide mode,

954
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
only probe and optical lattice.

955
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
The optical lattice

956
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
is ready-tuned.

957
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
The light in the whole system

958
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
is ready-tuned.

959
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
All the atoms we see

960
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
should have

961
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
the same

962
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
probe frequency

963
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
to see the atoms.

964
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But we found that

965
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
they all fall down.

966
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I found that

967
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
this is the Kashmir Force.

968
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The Kashmir Force

969
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
is an attraction.

970
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
The amount of excited state

971
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
is more than ground state.

972
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It can make

973
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
the probe frequency

974
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
decrease.

975
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
You can see the redshift frequency.

976
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
At the same time,

977
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
you can see the same phenomenon in CM.

978
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
If I ask

979
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
in this way,

980
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
if you don't add Kashmir Force,

981
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
the simulation resolution

982
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
will be too high.

983
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
If you compare the experimental data,

984
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
how much inconsistency

985
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
does it have?

986
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
For example,

987
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
we don't know how strong

988
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
the caterpillar coefficient is.

989
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
We can extract it in this way.

990
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm very interested in this.

991
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
We can get a number

992
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
which is difficult to measure.

993
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
There is a reason.

994
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
The caterpillar

995
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
has a

996
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
potential

997
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
which is

998
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
1 over z3.

999
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It's a

1000
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
1 over z3

1001
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
dependent.

1002
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It's a

1003
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
very fast

1004
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
potential.

1005
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
The closer it is to the origin,

1006
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
the faster it runs.

1007
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
The interaction time

1008
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
with the deep place is very short.

1009
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
The shift here is

1010
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
negative 20

1011
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
megahertz.

1012
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It corresponds to

1013
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
1 millikelvin.

1014
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I don't remember

1015
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
the distance.

1016
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Maybe it's

1017
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
outside of dozens of nanometers.

1018
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's almost gone.

1019
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
We can match

1020
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
the approximate value.

1021
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
If you want to match it accurately,

1022
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
it's hard to do it in this way.

1023
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Do you publish this?

1024
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Can I find the details?

1025
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Yes, we have

1026
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
a paper in PNAS

1027
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
which mentions this.

1028
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
You can send me the link later.

1029
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
The purpose of the paper is not to measure this.

1030
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I know.

1031
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
My idea is

1032
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
there is a potential

1033
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
which can be optimized

1034
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
to Casimir force detector.

1035
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Obviously, this is not the purpose.

1036
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It looks like there is a chance.

1037
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm interested in

1038
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Casimir force

1039
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
coupled to new physics.

1040
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I remember there is a paper

1041
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
which uses blue evanescent field

1042
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
to balance the atoms.

1043
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It can measure

1044
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Casimir force in this way.

1045
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's a bit tiring.

1046
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
We can't design

1047
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
a stable trap

1048
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
to balance it.

1049
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
There is a potential

1050
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
which can be optimized

1051
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
to Casimir force.

1052
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I think it's cool.

1053
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
We can discuss it later.

1054
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Do you have any questions?

1055
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
If you don't have any questions,

1056
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
please turn on the microphone.

1057
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Let's give a round of applause

1058
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
to Peng Lu for his speech.

1059
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Thank you.

1060
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Thank you.
