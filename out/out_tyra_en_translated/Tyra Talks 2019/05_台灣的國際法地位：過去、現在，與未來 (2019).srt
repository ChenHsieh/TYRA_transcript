00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Welcome everyone to today's Terra Talk, we are very honored to invite our speaker, Mr. Huang Shengfeng, to tell us about today's topic, Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I am very happy, because we have a long time in fact, there are no humanities or social science-related speeches.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today, it is easy to invite Mr. Shengfeng, and Mr. Shengfeng is now in Edinburgh, he is 12 o'clock in the middle of the night to speak for everyone, so thank him very much.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:50,000
First, let me introduce the background of Shengfeng. Shengfeng is the founder of Taipeng International Law, the founder of the Taiwan Voter Alliance.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He previously studied law at Taipei University and the Law Department of Taipei University, and then studied international law at the University of London, and now studies international law at Edinburgh University.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He is going to talk to us about the topic of Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A small reminder, if you don't turn on the microphone, you can't hear the applause, so let's turn on the microphone together, and thank Shengfeng for bringing us today's speech.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello everyone, I am Huang Shengfeng. Today I am very happy to have this opportunity to share with you some of the results of my research so far.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My research topic is Taiwan's international law positioning, the past, the present and the future.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:14,000
At the beginning of the speech, I would like to share a sentence with everyone. This is what Albus Dumbledore said in Harry Potter.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sometimes we must choose between what is right and what is easy.

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In the end, it created today's situation. When we want to solve some problems in the future, we must continue to face many choices.

13
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know if the Taiwanese will choose the right choice or the simple and easy choice. I think this may determine our future.

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
At the beginning of this speech, I hope everyone can keep this sentence in mind.

15
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Later, when I talk about the content, you can take this sentence out from time to time and think about it.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
At that time, what did the Taiwanese think or what choices did the Taiwanese make in the end? What should we do in the future?

17
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There are three main topics I want to share today. The first is the background knowledge of international law.

18
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The second is the past and present of international law. The last is the future.

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The background knowledge of international law is because most of the people who come to listen to my presentation today are not legal background.

20
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So they may not know much about this aspect. I want to do some basic background explanation first.

21
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then I will start to talk about our internal topics.

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
First of all, we need to understand what international law is.

23
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
International law is the basic rule of law between political entities.

24
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What is the political entity on international law?

25
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Basically, it includes the so-called sovereign state.

26
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The second is the so-called international organization, such as the United Nations, WHO, and WTO.

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
These are also political entities on international law.

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The other is the implementation of autonomous units, such as Taiwan or Somaliland.

29
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I put Taiwan in the implementation of autonomous units, not in the country.

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This means that at least so far, under the definition of international law, Taiwan has not yet been recognized as a sovereign state.

31
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Of course, everyone may have different ideas.

32
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But from the perspective of international law, Taiwan is not yet.

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course, I will say why it is not.

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In addition, international law is the principle that determines the rights and obligations of the political entity on international law and its right to carry out its obligations.

35
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The scope of international law is actually very wide.

36
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Generally, when people hear international law, they sometimes feel that it is related to a place, a country, or diplomacy.

37
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
In fact, the scope of international law is very wide, including political, economic, military, and human rights.

38
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
For example, international relations, diplomacy, and business.

39
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then there is economic, import-export trade, currency exchange, financial transactions, and securities transactions.

40
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
In fact, today some people say that international law does not seem to have any effect.

41
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
In fact, if we want to implement import-export trade, or even if we want to study abroad,

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
or when you go sightseeing and need to exchange foreign currency, this is also related to international law.

43
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Even now, some people may be in the United States, and then you can buy and sell securities and goods from other countries.

44
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
These financial transactions are all related to international law.

45
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then, for example, the military part, such as hand-to-hand combat, stop-and-go, how to end the war, military occupation.

46
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then, for example, the restrictions on nuclear and biological weapons.

47
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
For example, recently, the US withdrew the Semiconductor Missile Agreement.

48
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
These are all related to the military.

49
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then, for example, the human rights part, such as the right to freedom, the right to self-determination, the right to life, the right to transport, and the human rights law.

50
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In fact, basically, we can say that as long as you have a connection with other countries, no matter what form of connection it is, it will be related to international law.

51
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hearing international law, there is often a reaction that international law is bigger and more powerful than fist.

52
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
However, it must be emphasized here that international law is not only bigger than fist.

53
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because if it is really bigger than fist, I believe that the biggest fist in the world now is the United States.

54
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But even if the United States has such a big fist, it can't stop it.

55
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That is, the wife of Palestine, she was born in front of the United Nations.

56
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The United States is only one vote in the United Nations, in the General Assembly, and in the Security Council.

57
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So it can't decide everything, although its fist may be the biggest in the world.

58
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
In addition, for example, China, of course, can't prevent the International Court of Justice from making a judgment against it.

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Of course, at this time, some people will say that although it is said that it is not conducive to its judgment, China is still my heart and my tree.

60
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But we have to think a little bit, that is, yes, that's right.

61
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Although the Philippine was against the South China Sea part of the International Court of Justice, and then the International Court of Justice put China on it.

62
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Later, the International Court of Justice made some of China's claims that there was no legal effect, that is, it did not have those rights.

63
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Although China later decided not to recognize these things, other countries made such a decision because of the International Court of Justice.

64
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So other countries, such as the United States, claimed that since the International Court of Justice believed that the right to claim did not exist,

65
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
then I followed the rules of the International Court of Justice, such as the International Ocean Law, and I exercised my freedom of navigation.

66
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There are other countries, such as the United Kingdom, who are also exercising their freedom of navigation.

67
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When other countries make a decision because of you, such as the International Court of Justice, and then let other countries obtain other basis on the International Law to exercise their rights, this is the effect of the International Law.

68
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So what the International Law represents is to tell everyone that there is more than just a fist in the international community.

69
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because even if you have a fist as big as China, and then it is not willing to recognize the decision made by the International Court of Justice,

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but other countries can still act according to the judgment made by the International Court of Justice.

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
At this time, even if China is dissatisfied, it can only look aside.

72
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
In this regard, I would like to let everyone know that the strong can set the rules, and the weak must comply with the rules.

73
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The International Law is actually a decision made by the great powers and the strong to discuss and make a political decision.

74
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The main purpose of the International Law is to allow different countries to solve disputes in a civilized and legal way, rather than a rapid war.

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So in this case, we can know that the International Law is to some extent a bit like a structure on the balance of danger.

76
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So in this case, even if it is a big country, it will feel that it is necessary to comply with the International Law.

77
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Because if it does not comply with the International Law, other big countries may not comply with the International Law, and then it will be a mess.

78
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
In the event that everyone gives up their strength, it may be the end of the world.

79
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For countries that are not strong, the strength is not so strong.

80
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In fact, it is more important to understand what the rules are made by these big countries, and then to make good use of these rules.

81
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because in this case, you are not saying that you are bigger than the fist, you are a small fist against a big fist, you will win.

82
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But if you follow the rules of the International Law, the rules of the International Law are a rule created by the power.

83
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
When you follow the rules created by the power to deal with other powers, you are like standing on the shoulders of a giant.

84
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Although you may be a small person, you are standing on the shoulders of a giant.

85
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The International Law is actually very useful, and in fact, for the weaker object, the greater the impact of the International Law, the stronger the meaning.

86
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
In fact, here I want to mention a simple example.

87
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,000
For example, after the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, it took 22 years and 24 days for it to become the representative government of China in the United Nations on October 25, 1971.

88
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
On October 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution No. 2758 was passed.

89
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
According to that resolution, the representative of China in the United Nations is the representative of the People's Republic of China.

90
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So we all know that although the People's Republic of China came to Taiwan because of the civil war, and the so-called mainland China was controlled by the People's Republic of China.

91
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But even though the power is so different, the People's Republic of China also took more than 20 years to enter the United Nations.

92
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So it's not that it's really bigger than the fist. If it's really bigger than the fist, it should have entered earlier, and it wouldn't have waited more than 20 years.

93
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Then again, like Palestine, it was after the independence of Palestine was announced on November 15, 1988. It took 24 years and 14 days for it to become a member of the United Nations.

94
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So we find that whether it is a strong, stronger foundation of the People's Republic of China, or a very weak Palestine.

95
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But after they were established, it took a long time for them to enter the international community, for example, to enter the United Nations.

96
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So we know that whether it is strong or weak, the international law has a certain impact on them.

97
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am here to talk about the United Nations, because whether it is the People's Republic of China regime or Palestine,

98
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
they entered the United Nations today in accordance with the regulations set by the United Nations itself.

99
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Of course, the regulations set by the United Nations International Organization also follow the regulations set by the international law.

100
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So basically everyone follows the regulations of the international law. No one says that I have a big fist today, so I can listen to me directly.

101
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Or that I am very weak, so everyone has to pity me. In fact, there is no such thing.

102
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I think that the international law has the greatest effect on the weak, which is to increase the competition with the strong, and then the political and legal defense.

103
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:41,000
In fact, this is especially important for Taiwan. I think that many people who come to participate today may have a nationality from other countries, for example, you may have a nationality in the United States.

104
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Maybe you don't feel so strongly about this, but if you say that the nationality you have today or the place you are in is a relatively weak place in international politics or international relations,

105
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
in fact, you will feel that if everyone is just a fist, there is not much effect.

106
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But if there is an international law as a backer, when you go to fight for some rights with others, you will have the opportunity to get what you want.

107
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Can I ask a question?

108
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You just said that there are three kinds of political entities in the world, the state, the WHO, and Taiwan or Somaliland.

109
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Then you just had a statement that all interactions between countries must abide by international law.

110
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I want to ask that the object of the international law is actually the country, that is, the ABC of the three A or ABC?

111
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
ABC.

112
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So all three are required?

113
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

114
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because I just said that the basic interactions between political entities in international law are regulated.

115
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So the political entities in international law include those three things.

116
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
OK, thank you.

117
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I think everyone has heard of the four elements of a country, namely territory, people, and government.

118
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Then there is sovereignty.

119
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:40,000
For example, if you were educated in Taiwan, you would probably know the four elements of a country, namely territory, people, government, and sovereignty.

120
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But I want to tell you that this statement is wrong.

121
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The reason is that sovereignty is something that a country will have after it is formed.

122
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So it is not a basic element that constitutes a country.

123
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It is something that you will have after you become a country.

124
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So if you say that sovereignty is an element that constitutes a country, this is a bit of a logical question.

125
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Basically, it should be said that it is not the so-called four elements, but the characteristics that a sovereign country should have.

126
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That is, in the Montevideo Convention on the Rights of the Nation, it talks about territory, people, and government.

127
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
In addition, there is the so-called diplomatic ability, which is the ability to communicate with other sovereign countries.

128
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I particularly emphasize the ability to communicate with other sovereign countries.

129
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And the important thing is that the sovereign country must treat you as a sovereign country.

130
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:06,000
When you communicate with the so-called official position, your diplomatic ability is truly recognized.

131
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So in fact, a country, a very interesting thing is that the so-called sovereign country needs to have characteristics,

132
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In addition to those entities that can be seen, such as territory, people, and government,

133
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The other part of the diplomatic ability is actually directly linked to the so-called recognition part.

134
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In fact, of course, some people say that you are or are not a country today, and you do not need other countries to recognize you.

135
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But now the question is whether you are a country or whether you can play the role of a country.

136
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
In fact, it depends on whether other countries treat you as a country.

137
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So whether or not you are recognized today is the key to becoming a country.

138
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But to be recognized by other countries, to recognize that you are a country, is to allow you to operate like a country,

139
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Or like a country, a basic prerequisite for connecting with other countries.

140
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So in fact, when we have the so-called territory today, and the people have the government,

141
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Then, with the diplomatic ability to be equal to other countries, you will have a so-called sovereign thing.

142
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In fact, the form of sovereign performance is that it can control or manage the land and people internally,

143
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Then you can have diplomatic relations with other countries.

144
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So in fact, sovereign countries need to have these characteristics.

145
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Basically, we can say that if it is a country, it will have these characteristics.

146
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But having these characteristics does not mean that you are a country.

147
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is a bit logical, that is, if P is Q, if it is not Q, it is not P.

148
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But you can't say that if P is Q, then if it is not P, then it is not Q. This logic is wrong.

149
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
OK, here is another basic knowledge.

150
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That is, we have to distinguish between the so-called country, the government, and the regime.

151
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The so-called country is a political entity with international law that dominates the national legal personality.

152
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The regime is a political group with practical power and governance ability.

153
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So if there is a group of people today and they form an organization,

154
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then that organization has practical control and can govern a certain place and govern a certain people.

155
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We can say that the organization built by this group of people is a so-called regime.

156
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then there is another so-called government. The government is a government that can represent the country, that is, represent the country externally.

157
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Then internally, it can govern the people and the land, and it is a regime that conducts diplomacy externally.

158
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The distinction between this place and this place is very important.

159
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because if we put these three things together today, we will often have problems when we judge some problems.

160
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Especially when facing the situation in Taiwan.

161
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There are a few points here. The first is that a country can only have a government that represents the country, the so-called government.

162
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The representative government is a regime that can represent the country.

163
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So we know that the representative government is a regime, but this regime has another special nature, that is, it can represent the country.

164
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
In a country, there may be several regimes at the same time, and these several regimes are in the so-called representative government.

165
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If there is such a situation, it is the so-called representative power struggle.

166
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The most direct example is China, which is related to Taiwan.

167
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:25,000
From October 1, 1949 to today, the representative power struggle between the People's Republic of China government and the People's Republic of China government.

168
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I also wrote the government here. In fact, we all know that they call themselves the government.

169
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
In fact, it is the regime of the People's Republic of China and the regime of the People's Republic of China.

170
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They are fighting for the position of the Chinese representative government.

171
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Which one wins will become the so-called Chinese government, the Chinese representative government.

172
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The other is Venezuela. Venezuela just happened this year.

173
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We know that the government of Maduro, and then there was a government of Guaido.

174
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Guaido is a leader of the ruling party.

175
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He thinks that the election of the Maduro government was problematic.

176
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He does not recognize the election result.

177
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
In addition, Maduro's previous governance had a big problem.

178
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
There was a very big financial problem in Venezuela.

179
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Guaido felt that he could not do it.

180
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He appointed himself as the temporary president and established the so-called transitional government.

181
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The interesting thing here is that the United States was the first to recognize that Guaido's transitional government was the representative government of Venezuela.

182
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The Maduro government is not the representative government.

183
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The interesting thing here is that other countries can choose which regime is the representative government of another country.

184
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
After their choice, they will follow their choice to deal with the government of this country.

185
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:15,000
For example, after the Maduro government decided to recognize Guaido's transitional government in the United States,

186
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
it ordered the U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela.

187
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The U.S. government's response is that we now recognize that Guaido's transitional government is the legitimate government of Venezuela.

188
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Since the U.S. government is not the legitimate government of Venezuela,

189
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
the U.S. government's request to the U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela is illegal.

190
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The U.S. government does not recognize this request.

191
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So the U.S. diplomats continue to stay in Venezuela.

192
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This is actually a very interesting situation.

193
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We know that countries have various characteristics.

194
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Some of these characteristics are necessary, while some are not.

195
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's see how these characteristics will change after the change.

196
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
First, let's talk about nationality.

197
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Every country has a nationality, which is its name.

198
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Of course, it can be changed, but its change will not affect its legal personality.

199
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
For example, if my name is Huang Shengfeng, and if I change my name to Lai Qingde, I will not become the former director of the Executive Yuan.

200
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The same goes for countries.

201
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
After the country's nationality is changed, its national legal personality will not change.

202
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
A recent example is that Swaziland was renamed Swaziland in 2018.

203
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Another example is that the Qing Dynasty changed its name to the Republic of China in 1912.

204
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I say that the Republic of China was renamed.

205
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You may think that the Republic of China was not founded by Sun Wen to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.

206
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
In fact, the Republic of China was founded by Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty.

207
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty issued a decree of abdication in 1912.

208
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
In this decree, he announced that the Qing Dynasty would be changed from an imperial system to a republic system.

209
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The Qing Dynasty would become the Great Republic of China, which was allied with the Han Dynasty.

210
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty appointed Yuan Shikai as the temporary government.

211
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The Qing Dynasty changed from an imperial system to a republic system.

212
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The Qing Dynasty changed its name to the Republic of China.

213
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The Qing Dynasty was later replaced by Yuan Shikai's temporary government.

214
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Some people may not believe it, but I want to make it simple.

215
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:13,000
In the 6th year of the Republic of China, the so-called Xuantong 9th year,

216
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
there was a thing called Zhang Xun's abdication.

217
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
If you have read the history of the Republic of China textbooks, you will know the so-called Zhang Xun's abdication.

218
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Zhang Xun's abdication means that the Republic of China changed from a republic system to an imperial system.

219
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So Puyi ascended the throne again.

220
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Let's think about one thing.

221
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
If the Qing Dynasty was overthrown today, if this country was overthrown,

222
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and the Republic of China was a new country, how could you change it back?

223
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's just a simple change of a system, and then the name was changed and changed again.

224
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
If you are building a new country today, how could you change it like this?

225
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
In fact, it's not.

226
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Because the Republic of China itself is the Qing Dynasty itself.

227
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It just changed the system and changed the name.

228
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So when Zhang Xun abdicated, because it was the same, it was able to return to its previous state.

229
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So Zhang Xun's abdication tells us that the Republic of China is the same as the Qing Dynasty.

230
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's just a different name. It's just a different system.

231
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This is actually the so-called renaissance constitution.

232
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We can think of it this way.

233
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
In fact, this is the renaissance constitution.

234
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The Qing Dynasty changed the name to the Republic of China.

235
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Originally, the Qing Dynasty did not have a constitution.

236
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Later, the Republic of China was changed to a temporary constitution.

237
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It is the so-called renaissance constitution.

238
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The renaissance constitution is no different from the constitutional constitution advocated by some people today.

239
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So I found that if you change the name of a country, change its system, or make some regulations,

240
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
it will not affect the nature of this country.

241
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Another so-called government.

242
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If necessary, it can be changed.

243
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Its change does not affect the national law.

244
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let me give you an example.

245
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
In 1928, China's representative government changed from the US government to the national government.

246
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The textbooks of the Republic of China tell us that

247
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Jiang Jieshi led the North and later unified China.

248
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The North was successful.

249
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In fact, the process of the whole North was the so-called Beiyang government, the representative government of China.

250
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It was overthrown by the rebellious government.

251
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That is to say, before the completion of the North,

252
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Jiang Jieshi led the so-called national government.

253
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
In fact, it was a rebellious government.

254
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
After the rebellious government successfully overthrew the original representative government,

255
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
there was no other government in the Republic of China to compete with it.

256
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So the national government became the representative government of the Republic of China.

257
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Other countries originally came to the Republic of China with the Beiyang government.

258
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Later, the Beiyang government was eliminated and replaced by the national government.

259
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Other countries continue to come to the national government.

260
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
They are from the same country, but they still come from China.

261
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
They just come from different governments.

262
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
In fact, this is the meaning of the civil war in the Republic of China.

263
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The civil war in the Republic of China is that the national government meets another competitor.

264
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The system can be changed when necessary.

265
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Its change does not affect the national law.

266
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Here, we mentioned that China changed from a geological system to a republic system in 1912.

267
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
For example, France changed from a geological system to a republic system in the French Revolution in 1792.

268
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We know that France is now the fifth republic.

269
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
In other words, after the French Revolution, it first became a republic system.

270
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

271
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

272
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

273
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Then Napoleon came out to claim the throne and returned to the geological system.

274
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So we know that a country's system can be changed.

275
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Geological system, republic system, etc.

276
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But the country is still the same.

277
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Otherwise, we would not talk about the so-called French Revolution.

278
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
They are all from the same country.

279
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's just a system change.

280
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
In addition, there is the Constitution.

281
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The Constitution is not necessary.

282
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Because if the Constitution is necessary, we will find that there may be no country before the so-called military constitution.

283
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
In fact, it is not.

284
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because before the military constitution, all countries are monarchical systems.

285
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
There is no Constitution.

286
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But these countries still exist.

287
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Even to this day, they still belong to the imperial system.

288
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
For example, we have some chief states on the Arabian Peninsula.

289
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
These chief states are the imperial system.

290
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They do not have the Constitution.

291
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
The Constitution is re-created and revised.

292
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
No matter how many times, it does not affect the order of the National Security Council.

293
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Or change it.

294
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
For example, I can say that the French constitution is 17 times.

295
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You may be surprised.

296
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The French constitution is 17 times.

297
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Re-created.

298
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Not revised.

299
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Re-created 17 times.

300
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The latest constitution has been revised 24 times.

301
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But we will not say that the French constitution is 17 times.

302
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So France died and was born again.

303
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Died and was born again.

304
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
More than ten times.

305
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We do not think so.

306
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It is still the same country.

307
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So, the Constitution or the revision of the Constitution will not affect the national character.

308
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
In addition, there is the state flag.

309
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The state flag is actually unnecessary.

310
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
No one stipulates that the country must have a state flag.

311
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But that is a symbol.

312
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So usually there will be.

313
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
To change it will not affect the national character.

314
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The national anthem is the same.

315
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Here we will start to enter the topic.

316
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Taiwan's international law status.

317
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Here we have to define what Taiwan is.

318
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Taiwan actually has several definitions.

319
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The most common is that

320
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
In the current range of the People's Republic of China regime.

321
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Including Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen.

322
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There are other regions controlled by the regime in reality.

323
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
For example, Dongsha Island, Taiping Island.

324
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
These places.

325
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The other is Guangyi.

326
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That is the so-called island of Taiwan.

327
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
With its affiliated islands.

328
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Then there is Penghu Island.

329
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
This is Guangyi.

330
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That is the island of Taiwan.

331
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
With its affiliated islands.

332
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That is not included in Penghu Island.

333
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
That is the island of Taiwan.

334
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
In today's briefing.

335
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Unless I list Penghu at the same time today.

336
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Otherwise, basically speaking.

337
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
This is Guangyi.

338
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This is the island of Taiwan.

339
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
With its affiliated islands.

340
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then there is Penghu Island.

341
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That does not include other places.

342
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So it does not include Kinmen, Mazu.

343
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And Dongsha, Taiping.

344
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
These places.

345
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
In fact, the past of Taiwan.

346
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In fact, history is very long.

347
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But because what we are going to talk about today.

348
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It is relatively close to the modern history of Taiwan.

349
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So I think I will.

350
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Probably from Taiwan and China.

351
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Began to be involved.

352
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
For example, modern China.

353
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Let's start with less involved places.

354
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But in this place.

355
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We can take a look first.

356
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This is the Qing Dynasty.

357
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The emperor of the Qing Dynasty.

358
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
This is Emperor Yongzheng.

359
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
He said.

360
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Taiwan has not belonged to China since ancient times.

361
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The imperial examination of the God of War revealed the map.

362
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The imperial examination of the God of War revealed the map.

363
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This is the father of Emperor Yongzheng.

364
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Also Emperor Kangxi.

365
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
In other words.

366
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
This place in Taiwan.

367
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Until Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty.

368
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
To really enter the so-called map of China.

369
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But before that.

370
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Basically speaking.

371
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Taiwan is not part of China.

372
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So we know.

373
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
People's Republic of China.

374
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Now claim that Taiwan is part of China.

375
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The indivisible part.

376
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Since ancient times.

377
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We know.

378
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
In fact, many people do not agree with the facts.

379
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
In this place.

380
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I think there are some points.

381
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
For example.

382
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Because I'm talking about this now.

383
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
China is related to Taiwan.

384
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And it is related to modern Taiwan.

385
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So we jump directly.

386
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Jump to 1662.

387
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Is the part of Zheng Chenggong's defeat of the Netherlands.

388
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Before that.

389
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Is that.

390
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Other western countries.

391
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The part of the people of Taiwan.

392
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
The place has jumped.

393
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
In 1662.

394
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Zheng Chenggong's defeat of the Netherlands.

395
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
We know.

396
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The so-called anti-Qing people.

397
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Later.

398
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Not long after he came to Taiwan.

399
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Died.

400
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
His son.

401
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Zheng Jing.

402
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Later.

403
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Established the so-called Donglin Kingdom.

404
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That.

405
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Donglin Kingdom.

406
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
On the island of Taiwan.

407
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Is.

408
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
More.

409
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The Chinese side.

410
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Is.

411
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
In fact.

412
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
In Taiwan.

413
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
More.

414
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The beginning of a systematic degeneration.

415
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Then.

416
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
In 1683.

417
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
In the 7th month of the Donglin Kingdom.

418
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
When he was at the Penghu Sea War.

419
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
He was defeated by the Qing Empire.

420
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Then.

421
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Surrender in September.

422
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
In October.

423
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Enter the sea.

424
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Enter Taiwan.

425
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Then he surrendered.

426
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So at this time.

427
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Because.

428
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
The Qing Empire.

429
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Then.

430
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This.

431
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The Qing Empire.

432
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Emperor Kangxi.

433
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Later.

434
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Decided.

435
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
To take Taiwan.

436
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Into the so-called territory.

437
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Of course.

438
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That is to say.

439
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The Qing Empire itself.

440
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
In.

441
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Defeated.

442
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Zheng Chenggong.

443
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Defeated.

444
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
After the Donglin Kingdom.

445
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Is.

446
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
To take Taiwan into.

447
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This.

448
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The territory of the Qing Empire.

449
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Inside.

450
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They also have a fight.

451
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But later.

452
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Anyway.

453
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
After a fight.

454
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So I still decided.

455
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
All right.

456
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Let's take Taiwan into the territory.

457
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But.

458
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
No active management.

459
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Then.

460
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
In 1867.

461
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This.

462
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The so-called United States.

463
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The Rovahao Incident.

464
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That is.

465
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
The United States.

466
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Uploaded.

467
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
He is.

468
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
In the east.

469
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Here.

470
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Then.

471
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Later.

472
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Accidentally.

473
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Into.

474
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
This.

475
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Taiwan's territory.

476
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Then.

477
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
As a result.

478
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Later.

479
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Many people were fired.

480
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That.

481
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Living.

482
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Living people.

483
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Run.

484
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Go to the Qing Empire.

485
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
A small report.

486
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
As a result.

487
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The Qing Empire said.

488
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Then he.

489
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Do not care.

490
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
From this place.

491
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You can see.

492
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
One thing.

493
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
That is.

494
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
For the Qing Empire.

495
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
For the Qing Empire.

496
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The so-called deep.

497
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
He does not think.

498
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Is his own territory.

499
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That is.

500
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
He can't control.

501
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The place.

502
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
He thinks.

503
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That is not actually his territory.

504
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So.

505
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's not his territory.

506
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Within the scope of things.

507
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's not.

508
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He can manage.

509
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So.

510
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
We can see from this place.

511
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
That is.

512
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The Qing Empire.

513
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Basically.

514
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What is his position?

515
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
On this island.

516
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
On this island.

517
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
He can control.

518
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
What is the position of the scope?

519
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That.

520
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The United States.

521
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Of course.

522
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Very angry.

523
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Ah.

524
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's good.

525
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Since you don't care.

526
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Then I'll do it myself.

527
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So.

528
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The United States.

529
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
He himself.

530
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Send troops away.

531
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
To Taiwan.

532
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So.

533
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This is the U.S. Marine Corps.

534
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Just.

535
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Landed in Taiwan.

536
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Then.

537
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
To this.

538
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The native of the Taiwanese people.

539
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Just.

540
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Fight with him.

541
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
As a result.

542
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Since defeated.

543
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Lost.

544
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
This.

545
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Now this is.

546
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The U.S. Marine Corps.

547
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Everyone knows.

548
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Hey.

549
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Almost everyone hears it.

550
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Wen Feng.

551
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Wen Feng.

552
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's it.

553
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Wen Feng.

554
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's it.

555
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Hey.

556
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
This.

557
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Is very powerful.

558
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But they lost to this.

559
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
The native of Taiwan.

560
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So.

561
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You can know.

562
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The native of Taiwan.

563
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Really.

564
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Very arrogant.

565
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So he.

566
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The United States.

567
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
These.

568
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The Marines.

569
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Attack the native of Taiwan.

570
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Return in the rain.

571
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Later.

572
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Three months later.

573
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Just.

574
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
In Langqiao.

575
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
With the head of the 18th Division of the Taiwan Army.

576
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
This.

577
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
This.

578
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Zhou Qidu.

579
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
He fought with him.

580
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Then.

581
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
He signed the so-called.

582
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Alliance of the Southern Xia.

583
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Then.

584
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Officially ended.

585
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
This.

586
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Luo Fahao Incident.

587
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Then.

588
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
This Alliance of the Southern Xia.

589
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Basically.

590
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That is to say.

591
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
In the future.

592
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
If there is a ship.

593
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
In case of.

594
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What kind of.

595
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
When the shipwreck happened.

596
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Then.

597
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
If they say.

598
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Raised a.

599
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
What label.

600
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
For example.

601
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Raised a red flag.

602
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Then.

603
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The United States.

604
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
This.

605
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Is.

606
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
A kind of agreement.

607
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
That.

608
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
From this place.

609
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
We can see that.

610
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
This.

611
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The United States.

612
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
With.

613
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
The aborigines.

614
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They signed.

615
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Such an agreement.

616
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But.

617
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Signed such an agreement.

618
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Is it representative of.

619
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This.

620
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
The Taiwan Army 18th Division.

621
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
They.

622
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
In the eyes of the United States.

623
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Is.

624
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
A country.

625
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
In fact, this.

626
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
To put on a question mark.

627
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Just.

628
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Because in fact.

629
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This is the US government.

630
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
They are with.

631
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Under the international law.

632
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Modern.

633
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Under the international law.

634
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The sovereign state.

635
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
The same.

636
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Can sign some agreements.

637
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Sign some agreements.

638
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So.

639
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Even if it is.

640
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Signed such an agreement.

641
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It does not mean that.

642
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
At that time.

643
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The United States.

644
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Is.

645
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
This.

646
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Taiwan Army 18th Division.

647
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
This piece.

648
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Recognize it.

649
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Is a country.

650
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But what we can be sure of is.

651
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
He thinks.

652
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
He is with a regime.

653
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Is signing.

654
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Just.

655
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Because he thinks.

656
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
He can control that place.

657
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
A regime.

658
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And then.

659
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
In.

660
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
In.

661
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
After more than a year.

662
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
This.

663
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Li Xian.

664
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Again.

665
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
With that.

666
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Zhuo Qidu.

667
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
In China.

668
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
The customs tax officer.

669
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Under the witness.

670
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Signing a memorandum of understanding.

671
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That's here.

672
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm talking about.

673
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Under the witness.

674
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So we know that.

675
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
This.

676
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This Chinese customs.

677
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The official.

678
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
He is just a witness.

679
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
He is not the party.

680
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So we know that.

681
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
In this case.

682
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It is a very.

683
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It is a very.

684
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It is a very.

685
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It is a very.

686
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It is a very.

687
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It's a very.

688
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's a very.

689
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's a very.

690
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's a very very memorable.

691
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It's a very memorable.

692
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
In this case it's a very interesting thing.

693
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The United States and.

694
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
With this.

695
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.

696
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.

697
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
The representative of the Manchen family from the south of Taiwan.

698
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Signed with him.

699
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This thing.

700
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
China's third-person role.

701
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
China's third-person role.

702
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
challenged

703
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Be a witness.

704
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
China's third-person role.

705
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Not be a person's character.

706
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Not be Person's anime.

707
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It can be seen from this that it means that China does not really believe that that place is his territory.

708
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Then there was an event at the peony bazaar in 1878 lecture.

709
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Then there was an event at the peony bazaar in 1878 lecture.

710
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Many people know.

711
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It is.

712
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Liu Lib LA.

713
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Liu Lib LA.

714
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
OK.

715
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Liu Lib LA.

716
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
OK.

717
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It is happening for thevious reasons.

718
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It is happening for vicious reasons.

719
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
After it, the land was villagers encountered with native people.

720
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
After it, the land was villagers encountered with native people.

721
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.

722
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.

723
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Then some language, culture Military politics is lost.

724
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Then some peko подборFF Escaped by battle.

725
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,700
At this time,

726
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
In the imperial State of Japan,

727
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
In the imperial State of Japan,

728
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,200
during the great British competition with the King

729
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,000
toward the imperial State of the New Republic.

730
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
during the great British competition with the King

731
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The曷ren commander of the Imperial Japanese Palace

732
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The曷ren commander of the Imperial Japanese Palace

733
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Recently, he Roosevelt asked

734
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,000


735
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Recently, he Roosevelt asked

736
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The one who killed the King of Taiwan

737
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The one who killed the King of Taiwan

738
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,760
You are not the King of the Empire

739
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,000
You are not the king of the empire

740
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,460
The great New Empire not to

741
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,460


742
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,460


743
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
The great New Empire

744
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
The great New Empire

745
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,460
King's imperial reuse

746
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
King's imperial rebirth

747
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:45,460


748
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,460
The great New Empire said

749
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,460
This is a self-degraded rebirth

750
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,460
In other words

751
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,460
The great New Empire said

752
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,460
These people can't control

753
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,460
So we found that

754
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,460
It's the same as the Roosevelt incident

755
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,460
The attitude of the great New Empire is like this

756
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,460
The attitude of Japan is OK

757
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,460
Well, since that's the case

758
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,460
You think these

759
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,460
The place where the rebirth is located is not your territory

760
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,460
Then you can't control these

761
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,460
Then I'll take care of it, right?

762
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,460
Because I think the Great Japanese Empire said

763
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,460
I think the King of the Empire

764
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,460
It's also my territory

765
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
So I want to protect my territory

766
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
So I'm going to punish

767
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,460
These rebirths in Taiwan

768
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,460
So Japan sent troops to the so-called five main regions

769
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,460
Five main regions

770
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,460
So later

771
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,460
Japan, of course, sent troops to attack

772
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,460
Mutan Temple, Kaosifu Temple

773
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,460
And then

774
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,460
After defeating these aborigines

775
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,460
He camped in that place

776
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
For the Great Japanese Empire

777
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
It's actually a very embarrassing thing

778
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,460
That is

779
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,460
You are the Great Japanese Empire

780
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,460
You go to this island of Taiwan today

781
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,460
You have to go

782
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,460
For your

783
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,460
The fishermen of the King of the Empire

784
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,460
Go to

785
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,460
It's OK to achieve justice

786
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,460
But after you go there to fight

787
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
You stay there

788
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
No

789
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,460
Because he

790
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
The Great Japanese Empire still thinks that

791
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,460
The island of Taiwan is mainly his

792
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,460
Although Japan is there

793
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
Stay there

794
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,460
What do you think

795
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,460
So the Great Japanese Empire later

796
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,460
To find a way

797
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,460
To get rid of these things

798
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,460
So later

799
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,460
Through the intervention of the British Empire

800
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,460
Then signed the Beijing Treaty

801
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
After that

802
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,460
It's agreed in it

803
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,460
After that, these places on the island of Taiwan

804
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,460
These rebirths

805
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,460
The Great Japanese Empire has to find a way

806
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,460
To restrain

807
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,460
In fact, to some extent

808
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,460
This also means that

809
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,460
Britain is here

810
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,460
It's a statement

811
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,460
All right

812
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,460
People in these places

813
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,460
Basically

814
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,460
Or you have to manage

815
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,460
Or you have to manage

816
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,460
You have to manage

817
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,460
I think it's a bit like admitting

818
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,460
The place where those rebirths are

819
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,460
In fact, it is still the territory of the Great Japanese Empire

820
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,460
So people in these places

821
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,460
You have to manage

822
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,460
such

823
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,460
In 1885

824
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,460
The Great Japanese Empire finally

825
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,460
Established it in Taiwan

826
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,460
After two years

827
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,460
Officially assigned to work

828
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,460
As a result

829
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,460
It didn't take long to establish

830
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,460
Ten years later

831
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Nine years

832
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,460
Then the Jiawu War happened

833
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,460
On March 23, Japan

834
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,460
One of the Penghu

835
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,460
Japan has occupied Penghu

836
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,460
So in the so-called Jiawu War

837
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,460
Penghu is actually

838
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,460
Involved in the war

839
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,460
But Japan

840
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,460
He has an army to occupy Penghu

841
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,460
Here I want to mention

842
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,460
In the past

843
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,460
Just before

844
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,460
Before World War I and World War II

845
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,460
In the International Law

846
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,460
Basically during the war

847
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,460
If you are in the war

848
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,460
This one

849
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,460
For example, the enemy occupied

850
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,460
His opponent's country

851
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,460
A piece of territory

852
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,460
When there is an occupation

853
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,460
Usually after the war

854
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,460
The part that was occupied

855
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,460
May be cut off

856
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,460
So in fact, Japan

857
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
On March 23, he occupied Penghu

858
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,460
Is meaningful

859
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,460
That is to say

860
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,460
Japan wants to say

861
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,460
He wants to eat Taiwan and Penghu

862
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,460
So anyway

863
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,460
On March 23

864
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,460
He sent the army first

865
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,460
To occupy Penghu

866
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,460
Later, when signing the contract

867
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,460
There is a big bargaining chip

868
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,460
Can ask the Qing Empire to give up Penghu

869
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,460
Here we can take a look

870
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,460
That is to say

871
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,460
The Qing Empire was in 1772

872
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
The scope he controlled

873
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,460
It's actually very small

874
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,460
In other words

875
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,460
After the Qing Empire

876
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,460
After he solved the Kingdom of Dongning

877
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,460
In 1772

878
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,460
The scope he actually controlled

879
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,460
It's still very small

880
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,460
Still limited to the original

881
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,460
The scope controlled by the Kingdom of Dongning

882
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,460
By 1884

883
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,460
Then in 1884

884
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,460
Then in 1884

885
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,460
The Qing Empire

886
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,460
The scope of control is relatively large

887
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,460
Just now

888
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Does anyone want to speak?

889
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,460
Just now

890
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,460
It's okay, you can continue

891
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,460
I'm sorry

892
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,460
OK

893
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,460
In 1772

894
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,460
The Qing Empire

895
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,460
The scope of control on the island of Taiwan

896
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,460
Is very small

897
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,460
Then in 1884

898
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,460
His scope of control is relatively large

899
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,460
But we found

900
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,460
In the middle of the island of Taiwan

901
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,460
Is mainly the mountainous area

902
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,460
The Qing Empire

903
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,460
Basically uncontrollable

904
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,460
But actually we see

905
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,460
This 1884

906
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,460
The Qing Empire

907
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,460
The scope he controlled

908
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,460
Actually in the eastern part

909
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,460
For example, in the so-called

910
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,460
The part of Beinanting

911
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,460
May be a little bragging

912
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,460
Because actually

913
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,460
The Qing Empire

914
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,460
In the middle of the east

915
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,460
His ability to control

916
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,460
Not so strong

917
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,460
Then in 1895

918
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,460
This

919
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
The Treaty of Maguan

920
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,460
The Treaty of Maguan was signed on May 8th

921
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,460
Then the Great Japanese

922
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,460
In terms of international law

923
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,460
The Great Japanese Empire is

924
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,460
According to this Treaty of Maguan

925
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,460
To obtain the Qing Empire

926
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,460
The rule of law in the Taiwan Strait

927
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,460
Then

928
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,460
After a few weeks

929
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,460
I said it was not really

930
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,460
To establish an independent democratic country

931
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,460
Then this is also particularly emphasized

932
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,460
It's not really independent

933
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,460
Why do you say that?

934
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,460
Because

935
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,460
In fact, Taiwan is a democratic country

936
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,460
Some people see Taiwan as a democratic country today

937
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,460
I think this is the Taiwanese claim

938
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,460
Independent

939
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,460
Is a pioneer

940
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,460
Then there is also the belief that

941
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,460
Is now going to restore the country

942
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,460
What is the restoration of Taiwan's democracy?

943
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,460
But the Taiwan Democratic Republic is actually

944
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,460
When it was established

945
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,460
In fact, it's just a delay

946
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,460
That's just to say

947
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,460
Some officials of the Qing Empire

948
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,460
Then there were some

949
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,460
Some scholars at the time wanted to say

950
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,460
They want to say

951
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,460
Announce independence as soon as possible

952
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,460
Then

953
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,460
See if there are other countries to intervene

954
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,460
Then let Japan

955
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,460
There is no way to put that

956
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,460
Taiwan and Penghu

957
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,460
Become its territory

958
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,460
Because we know that in the Treaty of Maguan

959
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,460
The original part of the Great Japanese Empire

960
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,460
Except for Penghu, Taiwan

961
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,460
Including those places on the Liaodong Peninsula

962
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,460
As a result

963
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,460
There is the so-called Three Kingdoms Intervention in Liao

964
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,460
So actually at that time

965
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,460
Some officials in Taiwan

966
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,460
There are some scholars

967
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,460
They are thinking

968
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,460
I will announce independence as soon as possible today

969
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,460
Then maybe other countries will intervene

970
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,460
Then Japan will put Taiwan and Penghu

971
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,460
Into the Qing Empire

972
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,460
So there is such an idea

973
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,460
So even the Taiwan Democratic Republic

974
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,460
Even that year

975
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,460
Its year is called Yongqing

976
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,460
You know that this is

977
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,460
Always loyal to the Qing Empire

978
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,460
So in fact, the Taiwan Democratic Republic

979
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,460
It's really not

980
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,460
It really means independence

981
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,460
So in terms of international law

982
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,460
After the establishment of the Taiwan Democratic Republic

983
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,460
Basically speaking

984
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,460
There is no country to admit

985
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,460
No other country

986
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,460
Admit the existence of this country

987
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,460
Everyone can see it clearly

988
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,460
No one wants to

989
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,460
Take advantage of this

990
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,460
So in terms of concept

991
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,460
Taiwan Democratic Republic

992
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Is on the mainland territory of the Great Japanese Empire

993
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,460
Taiwan's rebellion

994
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,460
The so-called Taiwan Democratic Republic was established by the rebellion

995
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,460
That's about five months later

996
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,460
This is the end of the military suppression

997
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,460
So the Taiwan Democratic Republic was destroyed

998
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,460
And then this

999
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,460
By 1910

1000
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,460
The Great Japanese Empire began to use force

1001
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,460
To annex the territory of the aborigines

1002
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,460
Then I say here

1003
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,460
Use force to annex the territory of the aborigines

1004
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Then in this place

1005
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:36,460
It's a way to conquer with force

1006
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,460
Before World War I

1007
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,460
Is to conquer with force

1008
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,460
Is to wage war

1009
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,460
Use force to conquer the territory of others

1010
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,460
Then expand your own sovereignty

1011
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,460
Territory

1012
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,460
In international law

1013
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,460
Is legal

1014
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,460
Before this

1015
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,460
Before World War I

1016
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,460
This is legal

1017
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,460
But after World War I

1018
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,460
Such behavior

1019
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Basically speaking

1020
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,460
It is deemed illegal

1021
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,460
That is because

1022
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,460
To avoid the country

1023
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,460
Expand the territory by force

1024
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,460
Anyway

1025
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,460
Is Japan

1026
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,460
The Great Japanese Empire

1027
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
He is using force

1028
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,460
To conquer

1029
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Can legally expand the territory

1030
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,460
During the period

1031
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,460
He used force

1032
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,460
To annex the territory of the aborigines

1033
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,460
Then he used this

1034
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,460
The so-called Five-Year Li Fan Plan

1035
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,460
Is to use force to conquer

1036
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,460
By January 15, 1915

1037
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,460
The Five-Year Li Fan Plan was completed

1038
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,460
It was announced to end on the 20th of the same month

1039
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,460
This is the so-called Taiwan Islands

1040
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,460
Out of the city

1041
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,460
That is to say

1042
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,460
On this day

1043
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,460
Taiwan Islands

1044
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,460
Every inch of land

1045
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,460
Is his true sovereignty

1046
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,460
Belongs to the Great Japanese Empire

1047
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,460
So we know

1048
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,460
Actually this

1049
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,460
Taiwan Islands

1050
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,460
The Great Empire

1051
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,460
He gave it to Japan

1052
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,460
In fact, it does not include the so-called

1053
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,460
Central Mountain Area

1054
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,460
Then there is the eastern part

1055
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,460
That is Japan

1056
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,460
After he used force to conquer

1057
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,460
He really got a complete

1058
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,460
Taiwan Islands

1059
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,460
Conquered sovereignty

1060
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,460
In 1943

1061
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,460
This

1062
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,460
Later

1063
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,460
After the island returned to Japan

1064
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,460
It's been a while

1065
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,460
Then this

1066
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,460
The Second World War broke out

1067
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,460
That

1068
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,460
On October 23, 1943

1069
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,460
The so-called Kairo Airstrike

1070
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,460
Then it says

1071
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,460
The Taiwan-Japan War will return to the Republic of China

1072
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,460
Then on July 26, 1945

1073
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,460
The Wade Declaration

1074
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,460
Then it says that the Kairo Declaration

1075
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,460
Must be implemented

1076
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,460
August 15, 1945

1077
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,460
The Great Japanese Empire

1078
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,460
This

1079
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,460
The emperor of the Japanese

1080
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,460
The Great Japanese Empire unconditionally surrendered to the Mongols

1081
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,460
I think

1082
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,460
Ok

1083
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,460
Then let's jump back and see

1084
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,460
This 1895

1085
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,460
I just said before

1086
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,460
I said that the Qing Empire

1087
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,460
He

1088
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,460
In that

1089
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,460
The 1884

1090
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,460
That one

1091
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,460
He said he was on the east side

1092
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,460
The part of the Northern Land

1093
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,460
Say that part is a bit bragging

1094
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,460
why

1095
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,460
You see, in 1895

1096
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,460
When the Great Japanese Empire

1097
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,460
The range it can control

1098
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,460
Not including the east

1099
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,460
That is actually very interesting

1100
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,460
That is to say

1101
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,460
Because this place actually represents

1102
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,460
That is to say

1103
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,460
Originally these places were all

1104
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,460
The Great Japanese Empire can effectively control

1105
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,460
Should be able to

1106
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,460
Effectively transfer to Japan

1107
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,460
But actually for Japan

1108
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,460
He said in 1895

1109
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,460
He is on the east side

1110
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,460
He still can't control

1111
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,460
That place is the aboriginal place

1112
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,460
But in 1920

1113
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,460
Found the island of Taiwan

1114
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,460
All included in the Great Japanese Empire

1115
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,460
Set up this administrative plan

1116
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,460
Japan also effectively governs

1117
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,460
So we know that

1118
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,460
In fact, the sovereignty of the entire island of Taiwan

1119
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,460
In fact, the Great Japanese Empire

1120
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,460
Is the first one

1121
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,460
A country with sovereignty over the island of Taiwan

1122
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,460
OK

1123
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,460
I just talked about this in 1895

1124
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,460
1945

1125
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,460
August 15, 1945

1126
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,460
This

1127
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,460
The emperor of the Great Japanese Empire

1128
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,460
Is to announce the surrender of the Five Straits

1129
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,460
Then on September 2

1130
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,460
The Great Japanese Empire

1131
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,460
He signed the surrender document

1132
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,460
The surrender document

1133
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,460
It is a ceasefire agreement

1134
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,460
That is to say

1135
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,460
After signing this

1136
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:07,460
Everyone will fire each other

1137
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,460
So this is just a ceasefire agreement

1138
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,460
The purpose is to end the battle

1139
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,460
Then the same day

1140
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,460
The same day

1141
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,460
Chief of the Allied Forces

1142
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,460
Commander Michael Arthur

1143
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,460
He ordered the Great Japanese Empire

1144
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,460
Issued what he issued

1145
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,460
General Order No. 1

1146
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,460
General Order No. 1

1147
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,460
Inside

1148
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,460
He agreed that

1149
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,460
The representative of the regime of the Republic of China

1150
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,460
According to the arrangements in the order

1151
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,460
In China

1152
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,460
Not including Manchuria

1153
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,460
In China

1154
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,460
Then in Taipeng

1155
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,460
Then 16 degrees north to north

1156
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,460
French Indochina

1157
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,460
Accept Japanese surrender

1158
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,460
Then

1159
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,460
Let's take a look

1160
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,460
Someone just said in China

1161
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,460
Then Taipeng

1162
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,460
Then 16 degrees north to north

1163
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,460
So I found out

1164
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,460
He is a division list

1165
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
So it means

1166
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,460
Taipeng is not part of China

1167
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,460
Then China

1168
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,460
It does not include Manchuria

1169
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,460
Then why is it planned like this

1170
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,460
Because at that time Manchuria

1171
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,460
Is handed over to the Soviet Union

1172
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,460
To be responsible

1173
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,460
Then go to surrender

1174
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,460
Then occupy

1175
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,460
Then October 25, 1945

1176
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,460
This is Chiang Kai-shek

1177
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,460
He sent the representative of the surrender

1178
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,460
Chen Yi

1179
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,460
To the Taipei Public Security Hall

1180
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Hold the Allied Surrender Ceremony

1181
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,460
But he held this

1182
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,460
When the surrender ceremony

1183
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,460
He did not say that this is

1184
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,460
The Allied Forces came to surrender

1185
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,460
He said this is called

1186
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,460
Taiwan restoration

1187
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,460
That

1188
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,460
At that time he

1189
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,460
The Republic of China regime

1190
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,460
Here in Taiwan

1191
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,460
Established a

1192
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,460
Occupation agency

1193
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,460
It's called

1194
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,460
Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency

1195
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,460
Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency

1196
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,460
Add the three words of Taiwan Provincial

1197
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,460
That because

1198
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
Actually this

1199
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,460
At this time

1200
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,460
Taiwan is just

1201
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,460
Allied Forces

1202
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,460
Military occupation

1203
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,460
That is to say, it is not really

1204
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,460
Return to the Republic of China

1205
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,460
The sovereignty did not really

1206
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,460
Return to the Republic of China

1207
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,460
That

1208
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Taiwan Provincial Administrative Officer Agency

1209
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,460
In fact, it represents the Allied Forces

1210
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,460
To Taiwan and Penghu

1211
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,460
Occupation

1212
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,460
But because

1213
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,460
The Republic of China is thinking

1214
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,460
Anyway, that

1215
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,460
The Cairo Times said that

1216
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,460
Taiwan and Penghu

1217
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,460
After Japan surrendered

1218
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,460
Will return to the Republic of China

1219
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,460
So he just

1220
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,460
A little bit like

1221
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,460
Before and after

1222
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,460
A little bit like

1223
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,460
Five tickets after getting on the bus

1224
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,460
So he just

1225
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,460
Established the so-called

1226
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,460
Administrative Officer Agency

1227
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,460
Then add Taiwan Provincial in front

1228
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,460
That goes with that

1229
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,460
Taiwan Guangfu

1230
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,460
That

1231
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,460
January 12, 1946

1232
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,460
The Republic of China regime

1233
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,460
He issued

1234
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,460
Administrative order

1235
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,460
Then restore Taiwan Penghu

1236
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,460
Well-known

1237
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,460
Republic of China nationality

1238
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,460
That

1239
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,460
Britain and the United States

1240
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,460
In this place

1241
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,460
He protested

1242
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,460
He said because of Taiwan Penghu sovereignty

1243
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,460
At this time

1244
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,460
Still belong to Japan

1245
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,460
So you have to say

1246
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,460
Britain and the United States are clear

1247
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
He said there was no Taiwan Guangfu

1248
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,460
This kind of thing

1249
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,460
No 18

1250
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,460
December 15, 1945

1251
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,460
No Taiwan Guangfu

1252
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,460
This kind of thing

1253
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,460
Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

1254
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,460
In 1942

1255
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,460
Still belong to Japan

1256
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,460
So they said

1257
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,460
You can't be in the Republic of China

1258
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,460
Just like this

1259
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,460
Directly to the occupation

1260
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,460
People's nationality

1261
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,460
But the Republic of China

1262
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,460
He continues

1263
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
I do what I do

1264
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,460
So anyway

1265
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,460
He still does

1266
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,460
But in international law

1267
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,460
In fact, at that time

1268
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,460
Taiwanese people

1269
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,460
Taiwan and Penghu

1270
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,460
Residents

1271
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,460
They

1272
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,460
In international law

1273
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,460
He still has

1274
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,460
Still have

1275
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,460
Great Japanese Empire

1276
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,460
Is the nationality of Japan

1277
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,460
But at this time

1278
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,460
They have one more

1279
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,460
The so-called Republic of China nationality

1280
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,460
So at that time

1281
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,460
Taipeng resident

1282
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,460
Double nationality

1283
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,460
Everyone has two nationalities

1284
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,460
Then

1285
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,460
On February 28, 1947

1286
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,460
Then

1287
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,460
Then all the way to the same April

1288
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,460
On February 28, the Great Lusha

1289
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,460
This thing

1290
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,460
In fact, here we can know

1291
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,460
Say

1292
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,460
In fact, here

1293
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,460
What happened

1294
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,460
It's definitely not the government

1295
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,460
With his name

1296
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,460
Is a national government

1297
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,460
With his people

1298
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,460
Conflict

1299
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,460
It's not the case

1300
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,460
The situation here is

1301
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,460
A

1302
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,460
Occupation

1303
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,460
In

1304
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,460
Occupation of the victorious country

1305
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,460
On the territory of the defeated country

1306
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,460
The act of slaughtering the people of the defeated country

1307
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,460
This is definitely not what

1308
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,460
It's not an official-civilian conflict

1309
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,460
It's not an official-civilian conflict

1310
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,460
This is

1311
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,460
Cross-national slaughter

1312
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,460
Because after the February 28 incident

1313
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,460
This

1314
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,460
The people of Taiwan are of course

1315
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,460
For this

1316
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,460
The regime of the Republic of China

1317
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,460
Very dissatisfied with the situation here in Taiwan

1318
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,460
Then they also made a request

1319
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,460
Request that the governor-general of Taiwan province

1320
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,460
Require him to be re-elected

1321
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,460
Become the provincial government of Taiwan

1322
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,460
Because he thinks

1323
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,460
Chen Yi is like another

1324
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,460
Like the Governor-General of Taiwan

1325
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,460
That

1326
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,460
The regime of the Republic of China

1327
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,460
Later on April 22

1328
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,460
When it was

1329
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
Re-elected the provincial government of Taiwan

1330
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,460
That

1331
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,460
On May 17, the provincial government of Taiwan

1332
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,460
Officially operated

1333
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,460
Then in front of this

1334
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,460
I want to talk about it

1335
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,460
Re-elect the governor-general of Taiwan province

1336
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,460
Re-elected

1337
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,460
Re-elected the provincial government of Taiwan

1338
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,460
This is actually

1339
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,460
The requirements that the people of Taiwan put forth

1340
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,460
This is the requirements that the people of Taiwan put forth

1341
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,460
It means that the people of Taiwan

1342
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,460
At that time

1343
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,460
They think they are

1344
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,460
Citizens of the Republic of China

1345
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,460
And don't think they are

1346
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,460
People occupying the land

1347
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,460
So they will make such a request

1348
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,460
So to some extent

1349
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,460
It means that I am Chinese

1350
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,460
So

1351
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,460
So this is actually a choice

1352
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,460
This is a choice

1353
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,460
The result of this choice

1354
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,460
Caused a big problem

1355
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,460
OK

1356
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,460
On May 17, 1947

1357
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,460
The provincial government of Taiwan officially operated

1358
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,460
On October 1, 1949

1359
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,460
The government of the People's Republic of China

1360
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,460
Witness

1361
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,460
I don't want to talk about witnessing

1362
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,460
Witness

1363
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,460
Because actually in this place

1364
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,460
What really happened

1365
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,460
Is not to establish another country

1366
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,460
But another government

1367
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,460
That also started on this day

1368
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,460
On October 1, 1949

1369
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,460
China

1370
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,460
There is a two-party regime

1371
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,460
There are two regimes under China

1372
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,460
Republic of China regime

1373
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,460
With the People's Republic of China regime

1374
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,460
These two regimes

1375
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,460
Began to fight

1376
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,460
Who is the representative government of China

1377
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,460
That has been fighting to this day

1378
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,460
Keep fighting to this day

1379
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,460
Still fighting to this day

1380
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,460
Some people may think

1381
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,460
No

1382
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,460
Now the government of the Republic of China

1383
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,460
Isn't it the government of Taiwan?

1384
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,460
Where is he fighting this thing?

1385
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
In fact, there is

1386
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,460
Why not

1387
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,460
Because we look at this before

1388
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,460
In 2017

1389
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,460
Panama

1390
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,460
He changed to recognize the People's Republic of China regime

1391
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,460
Is the Chinese representative government

1392
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,460
Of course, Taiwan is writing here

1393
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,460
What is Taiwan-Panamanian diplomatic relations?

1394
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,460
But we look at that time

1395
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,460
Republic of China regime

1396
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,460
What does his Ministry of Foreign Affairs say?

1397
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,460
He said

1398
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,460
Republic of China regime

1399
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,460
Between Panama

1400
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,460
The diplomatic relations between the two countries

1401
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,460
More than a century

1402
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,460
How does this century count?

1403
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,460
When did it start?

1404
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,460
Counting from 1910

1405
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,460
This is very interesting

1406
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:04,460
If the Republic of China regime is not China

1407
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,460
How could you

1408
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,460
If it's really Taiwan

1409
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,460
How could you be with Panama

1410
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,460
More than a century of diplomatic relations

1411
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,460
Because in 1910

1412
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,460
Taiwan is the territory of Japan

1413
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,460
So it's impossible for Taiwan to establish diplomatic relations with Panama

1414
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,460
So in 1910

1415
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,460
It must be China

1416
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,460
And the point is

1417
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,460
In 1910

1418
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,460
The Republic of China has not appeared yet

1419
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,460
Still the Qing Empire

1420
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,460
So we know

1421
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,460
The Republic of China is the Qing Empire

1422
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,460
So he just counted like this

1423
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,460
Then the Republic of China is China

1424
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,460
So from here we can know

1425
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,460
The Republic of China regime says itself is Taiwan

1426
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,460
This is actually a big question mark

1427
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,460
Republic of China government

1428
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,460
Until now

1429
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,460
It's still so determined

1430
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:43,460
It's still so determined

1431
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:48,460
In fact, the Republic of China regime

1432
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,460
It's all like this

1433
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,460
Look at him

1434
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,460
It's all like this

1435
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,460
There is no diplomatic country

1436
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,460
China

1437
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,460
This thing

1438
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,460
Take it from him

1439
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,460
There is still China

1440
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,460
Where is this attribute

1441
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:00,460
OK

1442
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,460
it is good

1443
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,460
On December 8, 1949

1444
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,460
Because of this

1445
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,460
Domestic relations

1446
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,460
Do you have any questions?

1447
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,460
No no

1448
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,460
I don't have a question

1449
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,460
Let's pause here for a moment

1450
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,460
Just to this

1451
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:19,460
Before the establishment of the People's Republic of China

1452
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,460
Because there are a lot of historical facts here

1453
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,460
quite a lot

1454
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,460
Let's stop here

1455
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,460
Before the establishment of the People's Republic of China

1456
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,460
Does anyone have any questions?

1457
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,460
Do you want to ask?

1458
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,460
I can ask

1459
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,460
You say

1460
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,460
I just

1461
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,460
I am a historian

1462
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,460
Then I also read some

1463
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,460
Some questions about international law

1464
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,460
Then of course

1465
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,460
I haven't talked about the key part yet

1466
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,460
Is the 1952 Sanhok Agreement

1467
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,460
I look forward to how you will interpret that thing

1468
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,460
But I think so far

1469
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,460
I heard a question

1470
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,460
Is that when you first defined the international law

1471
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
There are three

1472
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,460
It was just mentioned by Yan Yong

1473
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,460
Then you put Taiwan in the third

1474
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,460
He is just a full-time independent unit

1475
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,460
Instead of a country

1476
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,460
If your definition is like that

1477
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,460
In fact, you are still discussing

1478
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,460
That is to say

1479
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,460
You try to put the regime of the Republic of China

1480
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,460
Kick out of Taiwan

1481
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,460
Then think that the people of Taiwan can decide for themselves

1482
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,460
The government of the Republic of China is just one of the exiled regimes

1483
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,460
That is unreasonable

1484
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,460
Because of your own

1485
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,460
Your own

1486
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,460
The original assumption is that Taiwan is not a country

1487
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:31,460
If your original assumption is like that

1488
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,460
That is to say

1489
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,460
Taiwan can't get out of the Republic of the People's Republic of China

1490
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,460
Can't skip the Republic of the People's Republic of China

1491
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,460
Then talk to yourself

1492
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,460
I can be independent

1493
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,460
What can I do about this

1494
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,460
Do you understand

1495
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,460
Do you understand the mistake

1496
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,460
Ah, I think you

1497
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,460
This inference seems a bit strange

1498
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,460
Because why would you go to the Republic of China

1499
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,460
There is no way to escape

1500
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,460
It has nothing to do with him

1501
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I just heard it

1502
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,460
The feeling is the first one

1503
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,460
The first step is to say

1504
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,460
I want to make sure that we are on the same page

1505
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:07,460
You think Taiwan's current situation is not a sovereign state

1506
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,460
Right

1507
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,460
That's because it's all the way down

1508
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,460
The result is that Taiwan is not a country

1509
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,460
So I will

1510
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,460
That is

1511
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,460
I just said earlier

1512
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,460
Why is Taiwan not a country

1513
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,460
I said I would talk about it later

1514
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,460
Oh, so

1515
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,460
It's not that I make an assumption first

1516
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,460
No, no

1517
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,460
Is that I push it all the way

1518
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,460
Because in the end it will be made

1519
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,460
I will tell you that the whole way

1520
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,460
There will be a conclusion

1521
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:29,460
And the conclusion is

1522
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,460
Taiwan is not a country

1523
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,460
But Taiwan is really a

1524
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,460
A place of independent operation

1525
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,460
So I put this thing on

1526
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,460
That is to say, this is

1527
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,460
A political entity mentioned in the International Law

1528
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,460
Something that will appear

1529
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,460
Because Taiwan is really a political entity

1530
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,460
Participating in international society

1531
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,460
It doesn't matter if you continue

1532
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,460
Because of that 1952

1533
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,460
The San Francisco Treaty

1534
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,460
I think it's more critical

1535
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,460
I think

1536
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,460
How to explain that

1537
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,460
Because I think it's quite interesting

1538
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,460
Because I'm talking about this here

1539
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,460
The point is

1540
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,460
Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to who

1541
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,460
Because Taiwan's sovereignty

1542
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,460
Our sovereignty

1543
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,460
Because it says here

1544
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,460
Here

1545
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:11,460
Taiwan's sovereignty is not yet

1546
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,460
Belong to any

1547
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,460
Still in Japan

1548
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,460
Still in Japan

1549
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,460
Actually, I think this question is good

1550
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,460
But that's why

1551
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,460
The reason I stopped here

1552
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,460
This is what I will talk about later

1553
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,460
So before this

1554
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,460
About any historical events

1555
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,460
Do you have any questions?

1556
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,460
Because what Kiki said

1557
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,460
With the next thing to talk about

1558
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,460
Because that will be answered later

1559
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,460
That will be answered later

1560
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:38,460
I'm sorry

1561
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,460
The part where someone left a message

1562
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,460
Let me read it for him

1563
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,460
I want to ask

1564
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,460
Why is the Kinmen Mazu not in

1565
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,460
In your definition of Taiwan

1566
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,460
This will be talked about later

1567
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,460
Will be talked about later, right?

1568
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:52,460
But actually I will say

1569
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,460
A simple truth

1570
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,460
That is

1571
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,460
Because the Kinmen Mazu

1572
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,460
Never been

1573
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,460
Conceded by China

1574
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,460
The Kinmen Mazu has always been in China

1575
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,460
So its historical direction

1576
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,460
It's different from Taiwan

1577
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,460
From 1895

1578
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,460
There is a big difference

1579
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,460
Yes, it was in 1895

1580
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,460
Taiwan and Penghu were conceded to Japan

1581
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,460
So these two places

1582
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,460
After the defeat of Japan

1583
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,460
The problem of transfer

1584
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,460
It's different from the Kinmen Mazu

1585
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,460
Because the Kinmen Mazu

1586
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,460
It is inherited by the Manchurian government

1587
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,460
The Republic of China government

1588
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,460
Then the Republic of China government

1589
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,460
Later became an exile government

1590
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,460
So come to Taiwan

1591
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,460
The Kinmen Mazu

1592
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,460
Its sovereignty has always been

1593
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,460
Belongs to the Republic of China government

1594
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,460
But Taiwan

1595
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,460
Because in 1895

1596
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,460
There was a regime transfer

1597
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,460
Is to transfer to Japan

1598
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,460
Then after the defeat of Japan

1599
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,460
Gave up this land

1600
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,460
So Taiwan and Penghu will have problems

1601
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,460
Kinmen Mazu has no problem

1602
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,460
You secretly finished my thing

1603
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,460
Do you want to come and talk

1604
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,460
But anyway

1605
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,460
But I think this place should be a little bit

1606
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,460
Because I'll talk about it later

1607
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,460
Because it's not actually

1608
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,460
Sovereignty does not belong to the Republic of China

1609
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,460
But belongs to China

1610
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,460
Let's put it this way

1611
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,460
Because when

1612
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,460
We are talking about this part of sovereignty

1613
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,460
Sovereignty belongs to

1614
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,460
It must be a country

1615
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,460
The Republic of China

1616
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,460
It's actually in

1617
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,460
People's Republic of China

1618
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,460
Sovereignty appears

1619
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,460
A state of two regimes under China

1620
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,460
When

1621
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,460
At this time

1622
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,460
Actually the problem is

1623
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,460
That is to say

1624
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,460
That part of the territory

1625
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,460
Anyway, the territory of China

1626
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,460
Always the territory of China

1627
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,460
But

1628
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,460
Unless there is

1629
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,460
Unless there are other changes

1630
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,460
The status of the transfer of territorial sovereignty

1631
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,460
But this

1632
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,460
Republic of China regime

1633
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,460
With the People's Republic of China regime

1634
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,460
These two regimes

1635
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,460
Who is the representative government of China

1636
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,460
This is the problem

1637
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,460
But Kinmen and Mazu

1638
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,460
Always

1639
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,460
Always belong to the territory of China

1640
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,460
In other words

1641
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,460
Republic of China

1642
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,460
It's not a

1643
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,460
It's not a separate

1644
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,460
People's Republic of China

1645
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,460
country

1646
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,460
They are a

1647
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,460
Two regimes in a country

1648
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,460
Two

1649
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,460
Who is the representative government of the government

1650
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,460
regime

1651
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,460
So it's always been like this

1652
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,460
Always in this state

1653
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,460
So

1654
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,460
Kinmen has always been the territory of China

1655
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,460
That's also because of this reason

1656
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,460
So it becomes

1657
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,460
Kinmen has always been tied to China

1658
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:16,460
Taiwan and Penghu

1659
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,460
There is a situation of leaving China

1660
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,460
Now it's actually going to be discussed later

1661
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,460
Taiwan and Penghu

1662
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,460
Did you go back to China

1663
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,460
Did you go back to

1664
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,460
Become part of China's territory

1665
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:28,460
This is actually

1666
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,460
International law

1667
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,460
Top

1668
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,460
Issues to discuss

1669
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,460
I think everyone is asking questions

1670
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:34,460
It's almost time to break the meme

1671
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,460
Otherwise, let's continue

1672
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,460
Yes, let's continue

1673
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,460
OK

1674
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,460
it is good

1675
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,460
That 1949

1676
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,460
Then we know that this

1677
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,460
Because of the international war

1678
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,460
Then the Republic of China

1679
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,460
The regime of the Republic of China

1680
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,460
He passed the executive committee meeting

1681
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,460
Decision

1682
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,460
Then move the central government to

1683
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,460
Taipeng

1684
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,460
Become an exile regime

1685
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,460
That actually

1686
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,460
The United States

1687
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,460
These countries

1688
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,460
A little bit

1689
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,460
Forget it

1690
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,460
That is to say

1691
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:04,460
This one

1692
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,460
It was announced

1693
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,460
It was said that Taiwan and Penghu

1694
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,460
Anyway, sooner or later

1695
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,460
Return to China

1696
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,460
right

1697
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:11,460
that

1698
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,460
I don't care about him

1699
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,460
that

1700
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,460
In case it is said that Taipeng

1701
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,460
If it is said that in case

1702
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,460
That

1703
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,460
If the CCP eats it

1704
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,460
You just admit it

1705
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,460
But later because of the Korean War

1706
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,460
Just

1707
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,460
American attitude

1708
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,460
There are some

1709
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,460
This

1710
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,460
The attitude of the anti-communist country has changed

1711
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,460
They think this

1712
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,460
This communist country

1713
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,460
They are now

1714
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,460
To expand their power

1715
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,460
That way

1716
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,460
It's already

1717
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,460
The country itself

1718
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,460
Own

1719
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,460
The uprising between the people

1720
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,460
Or the form of revolution

1721
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,460
In addition

1722
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,460
There is also this

1723
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,460
Is to use force to invade

1724
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,460
So they think

1725
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,460
This is unacceptable

1726
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,460
So they think

1727
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,460
No way

1728
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,460
In this place

1729
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,460
I think the communist country

1730
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,460
Must be used

1731
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,460
In a more powerful way

1732
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,460
To fight him

1733
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,460
So at that time

1734
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:01,460
They just

1735
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,460
A conclusion

1736
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:03,460
That is to say

1737
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:04,460
Taiwan and Penghu can't fall

1738
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,460
Communists

1739
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,460
So at that time

1740
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,460
They just

1741
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,460
Maybe a

1742
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,460
The so-called Taiwan Strait

1743
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,460
Neutralization Declaration

1744
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,460
At this time

1745
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,460
He actually said

1746
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,460
That is to say

1747
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,460
Taiwan and Penghu

1748
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,460
This part of the sovereignty

1749
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,460
This question

1750
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,460
This has not been decided yet

1751
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,460
This has to be solved

1752
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,460
Wait until

1753
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,460
After signing a contract with Japan

1754
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,460
Then decide

1755
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,460
That's what they think

1756
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,460
Or wait for the Korean War

1757
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,460
After the end of the Korean War

1758
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,460
Decide again

1759
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,460
But later

1760
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,460
Of course

1761
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,460
There are some changes

1762
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,460
That

1763
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,460
On September 8, 1951

1764
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,460
Japan and 48 allies

1765
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,460
Members

1766
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,460
Signed the San Francisco Treaty

1767
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,460
At this time

1768
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,460
When signing the San Francisco Treaty

1769
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,460
China

1770
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,460
There is no

1771
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,460
Signed

1772
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,460
Of course

1773
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,460
A very important reason is because

1774
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,460
In the end

1775
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,460
China

1776
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,460
Which regime

1777
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,460
To represent the government

1778
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,460
To represent China

1779
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,460
This

1780
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,460
Allies

1781
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,460
There is a dispute between the members

1782
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:07,460
Like the United States

1783
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,460
I feel like I have to ask the Republic of China to come

1784
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,460
Like the Soviet Union

1785
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,460
He felt like

1786
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,460
There should be the People's Republic of China

1787
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:14,460
regime

1788
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,460
Everyone is arguing

1789
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,460
Irreconcilable

1790
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,460
So in the end

1791
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,460
China is not

1792
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,460
No

1793
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,460
Signed the San Francisco Treaty

1794
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,460
But in the San Francisco Treaty

1795
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,460
There is a special

1796
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,460
Part of China's power

1797
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,460
There are some

1798
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,460
Some

1799
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,460
Conditions

1800
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:31,460
In the second B of the San Francisco Treaty

1801
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:32,460
He is clear

1802
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,460
That is to say

1803
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,460
Japan gives up the right to Taiwan Strait

1804
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,460
Rights and demands

1805
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,460
This is a complete

1806
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,460
A way to give up the sovereignty of the Taiwan Strait

1807
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,460
Ok

1808
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,460
But he did not point out

1809
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,460
Who is the owner of the sovereignty of the Taiwan Strait?

1810
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,460
So this is in

1811
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,460
The so-called status of Taiwan is not set

1812
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:49,460
This legal basis

1813
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,460
The basis of the International Law is completed

1814
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,460
Before this

1815
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,460
For example, on June 25, 1950

1816
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,460
Taiwan's status is not set

1817
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,460
This position comes out

1818
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,460
Actually

1819
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:00,460
Because at that time

1820
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,460
In fact, Taiwan and Penghu

1821
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,460
Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to Japan

1822
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,460
Just say

1823
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,460
At that time

1824
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,460
In fact, Truman meant

1825
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:08,460
That is to say

1826
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,460
Taiwan and Penghu

1827
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:10,460
The status of the future

1828
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,460
Not sure yet

1829
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,460
That's just

1830
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,460
This is in the San Francisco Treaty

1831
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,460
Inside

1832
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,460
In the second B

1833
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,460
Directly put

1834
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,460
The status of Taiwan and Penghu

1835
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,460
Is not set

1836
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,460
This legal basis

1837
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,460
Set it up

1838
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,460
So through this treaty

1839
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:28,460
Inside this clause

1840
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,460
Inside Japan

1841
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,460
Then there is no designation

1842
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,460
Who will accept

1843
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:34,460
This one

1844
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,460
Let Taiwan and Penghu

1845
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,460
The final disposal

1846
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,460
In a

1847
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,460
Uncertain state

1848
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:40,460
On the International Law

1849
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,460
Taiwan and Penghu

1850
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,460
The status is in an uncertain situation

1851
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,460
In fact, in the San Francisco Treaty

1852
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,460
It's not just Taiwan and Penghu

1853
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,460
It's like this

1854
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,460
There are others like

1855
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,460
The West Shaanxi Islands

1856
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,460
The South Shaanxi Islands

1857
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,460
Then

1858
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,460
And Japan

1859
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,460
There were some at that time

1860
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,460
There will be some

1861
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,460
Tendao Islands

1862
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,460
Kuye Islands

1863
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,460
These places in the south

1864
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,460
In fact, they are all in the same form

1865
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,460
To standardize

1866
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,460
So basically

1867
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,460
All belong to the so-called status

1868
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:10,460
To a certain state

1869
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,460
Unless later

1870
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,460
There are other special disposals

1871
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,460
Taiwan and Penghu are not

1872
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,460
OK

1873
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,460
The second F below

1874
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,460
I told you

1875
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,460
He said to Mingding

1876
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,460
The part of the South Shaanxi and the West Shaanxi

1877
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,460
Japan is also in the same way

1878
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,460
To give up

1879
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,460
So this part is

1880
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,460
Japan gave up

1881
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,460
The sovereignty of these places

1882
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,460
Absolutely give up

1883
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,460
That was in 1951

1884
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:31,460
On November 19

1885
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,460
Japan's Yuren Emperor

1886
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,460
According to the request of the Japanese Cabinet

1887
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:37,460
To complete the certification of the San Francisco Treaty

1888
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,460
Then I'm here

1889
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,460
The reason for this particular point

1890
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,460
Because

1891
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,460
To some people

1892
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,460
I'm still arguing now

1893
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,460
That is to say

1894
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,460
Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

1895
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,460
Still belong to Japan

1896
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,460
That

1897
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,460
Their claim is

1898
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,460
Because of that

1899
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:53,460
The San Francisco Treaty

1900
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,460
Is

1901
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,460
Signed by the Japanese government

1902
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:56,460
Not the Japanese emperor

1903
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,460
Signed

1904
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,460
So it doesn't count

1905
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:59,460
Then I'm here

1906
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,460
Special mention

1907
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,460
That is to say

1908
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,460
The Japanese emperor has already certified

1909
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,460
San Francisco Treaty

1910
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,460
So he has already recognized

1911
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:05,460
So the San Francisco Treaty

1912
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,460
To give up the Taiwan-Penghu sovereignty

1913
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,460
The Japanese emperor has already recognized

1914
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,460
So Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

1915
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,460
No longer belong to Japan

1916
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,460
That

1917
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,460
In 1952

1918
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,460
On April 19

1919
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,460
Japanese Justice

1920
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,460
Sorry

1921
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:20,460
You say

1922
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,460
Can I ask a question?

1923
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,460
You say

1924
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,460
You said here

1925
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,460
Hey

1926
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,460
San Francisco Treaty

1927
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,460
China has no money

1928
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,460
Then my question is

1929
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,460
That way

1930
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,460
Does this contract still count?

1931
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,460
Or is this kind of contract

1932
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,460
Is to

1933
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,460
Big

1934
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:40,460
I don't know how to

1935
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,460
How does this contract work?

1936
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,460
If there is one

1937
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:44,460
From Mongolia

1938
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,460
This contract is still valid

1939
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,460
Thank you

1940
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:48,460
OK

1941
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,460
it is good

1942
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:50,460
Let's talk about it now

1943
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,460
San Francisco Treaty

1944
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,460
San Francisco Treaty

1945
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,460
It actually means this

1946
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,460
because

1947
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,460
The purpose of the contract

1948
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,460
Is to end

1949
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,460
The state of war between countries

1950
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,460
So in San Francisco Treaty

1951
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,460
Inside

1952
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,460
Every signed country

1953
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,460
Every signed member

1954
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:11,460
Are the countries that have fought with Japan before

1955
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:12,460
So San Francisco Treaty

1956
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,460
Actually

1957
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,460
Although it is Japan

1958
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,460
Signed with so many countries

1959
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,460
But actually

1960
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:18,460
He

1961
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,460
What I really want to say is

1962
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,460
This

1963
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,460
48 countries

1964
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:26,460
Have signed a contract with Japan

1965
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,460
That

1966
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,460
The effect of this contract is

1967
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:29,460
Happened in Japan

1968
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,460
With

1969
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,460
Between each signed country

1970
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,460
Is the effect of individual establishment

1971
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,460
Individual establishment effect

1972
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:38,460
So

1973
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,460
It's the United Nations

1974
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,460
Not a

1975
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:41,460
It's not like a company

1976
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,460
Something like a judge

1977
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,460
It is a

1978
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,460
Individual

1979
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,460
Gather

1980
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,460
So it's like

1981
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,460
When we sign a contract

1982
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,460
San Francisco Treaty

1983
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,460
Effective in Japan

1984
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,460
With

1985
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,460
Every

1986
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:53,460
Signed

1987
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,460
Between countries

1988
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,460
That did not sign

1989
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,460
That's the contract

1990
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,460
It doesn't work for that country

1991
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,460
But it won't affect

1992
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,460
Signed

1993
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,460
The country with the contract

1994
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,460
Efficiency between Japan

1995
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,460
and so

1996
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,460
In this place

1997
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,460
San Francisco Treaty

1998
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,460
Itself

1999
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:10,460
When it works

2000
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,460
Is

2001
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:14,460
All countries that have signed and approved

2002
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,460
This contract is effective

2003
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:17,460
That

2004
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:18,460
Not because

2005
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:19,460
Which one

2006
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,460
San Francisco members did not sign

2007
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,460
Then the whole contract will be invalid

2008
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,460
Or there is no way to work

2009
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,460
because

2010
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,460
The international law

2011
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,460
Basically speaking

2012
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:31,460
Between two countries

2013
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,460
Established

2014
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,460
one

2015
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,460
It's a contract relationship

2016
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,460
So

2017
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,460
Will not be affected by another country

2018
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,460
Is there a contract

2019
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,460
Unless they are in today

2020
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,460
In the contract

2021
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,460
In the contract

2022
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,460
Directly say

2023
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,460
Must have someone

2024
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:49,460
To sign

2025
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,460
Must have someone

2026
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,460
Approve

2027
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,460
This

2028
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,460
The contract is effective

2029
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:54,460
Otherwise

2030
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,460
Basically speaking

2031
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,460
Established in

2032
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,460
Every

2033
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,460
Signed between countries

2034
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,460
Any other country

2035
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,460
No money

2036
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,460
Does not affect the efficiency of the contract

2037
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,460
In fact, in this place

2038
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,460
San Francisco Treaty

2039
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,460
That

2040
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,460
San Francisco member

2041
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,460
Not only China

2042
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,460
The Soviet Union did not sign

2043
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,460
The Soviet Union is actually today

2044
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,460
Have not signed a peace treaty with Japan

2045
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,460
Peace Treaty

2046
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,460
From the Soviet Union to today

2047
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,460
Have not signed a peace treaty with Japan

2048
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,460
That

2049
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,460
Wait a minute

2050
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,460
Because I don't quite understand

2051
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,460
What is the contract for?

2052
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,460
Is to end the war between

2053
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,460
End the war between the country and the country

2054
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,460
The state of war

2055
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,460
Then there is

2056
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,460
Determine the compensation between countries

2057
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,460
So

2058
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,460
I can understand

2059
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,460
So this contract

2060
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,460
As long as Japan unilaterally recognizes it

2061
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:40,460
From each country

2062
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,460
Can complete

2063
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,460
No country

2064
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,460
Does it matter to sign?

2065
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,460
No

2066
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,460
Signed country

2067
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,460
Signed country

2068
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:48,460
To end

2069
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,460
The war between him and Japan

2070
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,460
If you don't sign

2071
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,460
War

2072
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,460
Will continue to exist

2073
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,460
So

2074
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,460
So that means

2075
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,460
China is now

2076
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:57,460
Theoretically still

2077
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,460
In the state of war with Japan

2078
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,460
No

2079
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,460
Because we haven't finished the history

2080
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,460
Sorry

2081
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,460
Because you don't have to sign

2082
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,460
You want

2083
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,460
You can sign another contract with Japan

2084
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,460
Contract

2085
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,460
In other words

2086
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,460
In other words

2087
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,460
Not just able to sign

2088
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,460
This kind of contract

2089
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:13,460
Every country

2090
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,460
Because

2091
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,460
Just say we are so

2092
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,460
For example, if there are 50 people today

2093
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,460
Right

2094
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,460
Fifty people fight a group

2095
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,460
Then

2096
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,460
Fifty people fight a man

2097
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,460
Then this person

2098
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:23,460
With everyone

2099
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,460
Everyone makes an agreement

2100
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,460
Some people say

2101
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,460
We use this set today

2102
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,460
Use this set of rules

2103
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:30,460
This condition

2104
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,460
We

2105
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,460
I made an agreement with you

2106
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:33,460
In fact, he said this set

2107
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,460
Condition

2108
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,460
I am not satisfied

2109
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,460
I want to talk about it again

2110
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:37,460
Yes

2111
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,460
So that's the state

2112
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,460
You can also

2113
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,460
With those countries that do not sign the agreement

2114
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,460
In another contract

2115
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,460
To end their

2116
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,460
The state of war

2117
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,460
Not just able to sign

2118
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,460
Not

2119
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,460
When you

2120
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,460
Between two countries

2121
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,460
You want to end the state of war

2122
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,460
Just sign a contract

2123
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,460
But

2124
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,460
In the case of so many countries

2125
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:54,460
Can

2126
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,460
You can have

2127
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:56,460
For example, 50

2128
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,460
Fifty

2129
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,460
Allied soldiers

2130
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:59,460
You can sign with Japan

2131
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:00,460
Is

2132
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,460
Between 1 to 50

2133
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,460
Between

2134
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,460
This contract

2135
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,460
To end this state of war

2136
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,460
But if

2137
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:08,460
For example, like here

2138
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,460
There are 48 members

2139
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:12,460
Decided to sign a treaty with Japan

2140
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,460
That

2141
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,460
It's these 48 countries

2142
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,460
The state of war with Japan

2143
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,460
Just based on the treaty to end

2144
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,460
Ok

2145
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,460
Then the rest did not sign

2146
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,460
They just

2147
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,460
In addition, use other ways to end

2148
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,460
Maybe it's a contract

2149
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,460
Maybe it's in other forms

2150
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,460
For example, some are

2151
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,460
What to publish

2152
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,460
To replace

2153
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,460
The same

2154
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,460
The same

2155
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,460
To achieve that goal

2156
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,460
But we are talking about

2157
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,460
48 countries

2158
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,460
48 allied soldiers

2159
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,460
Signed with Japan

2160
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,460
In the end, only 45 were approved

2161
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,460
That

2162
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:50,460
In addition, there are those three that are not

2163
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,460
They are actually later

2164
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,460
Also use other ways to contact

2165
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,460
The state of war with Japan

2166
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,460
Correct

2167
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,460
This is

2168
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,460
It's quite interesting

2169
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,460
That is to say, this one

2170
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,460
Maybe someone will say

2171
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,460
Is the allied forces coming together?

2172
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,460
No

2173
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,460
That is

2174
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,460
Countries

2175
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,460
Just gather together

2176
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,460
But he did not stipulate that

2177
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,460
Must be consistent

2178
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,460
Then all the same action

2179
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,460
To count

2180
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,460
No

2181
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,460
Each country

2182
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,460
Is an individual right

2183
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,460
Individuals can go to Japan to sign a treaty

2184
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,460
This is a country with its own

2185
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,460
That

2186
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,460
Because of that

2187
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:26,460
Uh

2188
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,460
There is another one

2189
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:28,460
This participant

2190
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,460
He has a question

2191
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,460
That

2192
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,460
That is

2193
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,460
China did not sign a treaty with Japan

2194
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:34,460
And so on

2195
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,460
This question of Taiwan

2196
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:37,460
I think

2197
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,460
This discussion is probably

2198
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,460
Probably answered this question

2199
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,460
Because we are a little late now

2200
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,460
That

2201
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:45,460
Uh

2202
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,460
Let's

2203
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,460
The user's question

2204
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,460
If he feels that it has not been fully answered

2205
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,460
After the speech

2206
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,460
Ask again

2207
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,460
Then talk about the parts that have not been answered

2208
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,460
OK?

2209
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,460
Then you end it first

2210
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,460
OK

2211
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:57,460
That user

2212
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,460
Sorry

2213
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:59,460
That

2214
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,460
Because China later

2215
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,460
Signed with Japan

2216
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,460
Ha ha ha

2217
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,460
OK

2218
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,460
it is good

2219
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,460
That

2220
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,460
April 19, 1952

2221
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,460
Then of course

2222
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,460
Posted that

2223
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,460
Private message

2224
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,460
That message said

2225
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,460
Taipeng resident

2226
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,460
The expiration date of the TPP Treaty

2227
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,460
Japanese nationality

2228
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,460
That

2229
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,460
TPP Treaty

2230
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,460
April 28, 1952

2231
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,460
So

2232
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,460
From that day on

2233
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,460
Taiwan and Penghu are no longer Japanese territory

2234
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,460
Then the sovereignty is in an uncertain state

2235
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:28,460
Then

2236
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,460
Taipeng resident

2237
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,460
He is no longer Japanese nationality

2238
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,460
No more Japanese

2239
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:33,460
Yes

2240
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,460
Now there are some people in Taiwan and Penghu

2241
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,460
There are still Japanese nationalities

2242
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:39,460
This is not always understood in international law

2243
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,460
Then let's talk about this thing now

2244
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,460
Is

2245
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,460
China signed a contract with Japan

2246
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,460
That is

2247
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,460
April 28, 1952

2248
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,460
On the day the contract came into effect

2249
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,460
Japan and the People's Republic of China

2250
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:52,460
Signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2251
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:53,460
What about this contract

2252
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,460
Because Japan was there

2253
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,460
He is

2254
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,460
Recognize the People's Republic of China as the Chinese representative government

2255
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:59,460
So at this time

2256
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,460
The effect of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2257
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:07,460
Is to end the war between China and Japan

2258
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:11,460
So although China did not sign the TPP Treaty

2259
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,460
But

2260
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,460
He signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2261
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,460
So it's still the same

2262
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,460
Then there is a point

2263
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,460
In the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2264
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:18,460
Article 2

2265
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,460
He clearly stated

2266
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:23,460
The two sides admitted that Japan had given up Taiwan in the TPP Treaty

2267
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,460
Taipeng

2268
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,460
Taipeng

2269
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,460
The complete sovereignty of the South China Sea and the West China Sea

2270
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,460
That's it

2271
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,460
It's over

2272
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,460
This is about territorial

2273
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:34,460
The part of Taipeng's sovereignty

2274
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:35,460
That's it

2275
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:39,460
Nothing else

2276
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,460
In fact, in this place

2277
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,460
This second article also means

2278
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,460
The People's Republic of China

2279
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,460
Basically through the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2280
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,460
He admitted that in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2281
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,460
Arrangements for Taiwan's absence

2282
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:52,460
In the fourth article

2283
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:57,460
This includes all the treaties between China and Japan before December 9, 1941

2284
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:00,460
This also includes the so-called Maguan Treaty

2285
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,460
There will be a question later

2286
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,460
But I will mention

2287
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:05,460
Article 10

2288
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:06,460
Taipeng residents and his descendants

2289
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,460
As a citizen of the People's Republic of China

2290
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,460
As a citizen of the People's Republic of China

2291
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,460
But here you have to pay special attention

2292
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,460
This is a citizen

2293
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,460
You are not

2294
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,460
Take you as

2295
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,460
It's called a citizen

2296
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,460
So in other words

2297
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,460
In fact, Taipeng residents and his descendants

2298
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,460
For the regime of the People's Republic of China

2299
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,460
Actually not his citizen

2300
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,460
He just took it as his citizen

2301
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,460
In law

2302
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:34,460
The Sino-Japanese Treaty was enacted on August 5, 1952

2303
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,460
it is good

2304
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,460
Then I just said before

2305
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,460
He signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2306
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,460
Article 10

2307
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:42,460
The absence of the Sino-Japanese Treaty before December 9, 1941

2308
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:43,460
All the treaties

2309
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,460
Including the Maguan Treaty

2310
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:48,460
Will Taipeng's sovereignty return to the People's Republic of China?

2311
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:50,460
That Japanese side is very straightforward

2312
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,460
It seems that in 1964

2313
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,460
The Taiwan Treaty Bureau said directly

2314
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:55,460
Jumped over

2315
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,460
We just said

2316
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,460
Such a treaty as Taiwan's abandonment

2317
01:23:58,460 --> 01:23:59,460
That is to say

2318
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:00,460
Complete the abandonment of Taiwan

2319
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,460
Once achieved the purpose

2320
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:04,460
After that, it will only be effective in form

2321
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:05,460
Because this is

2322
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,460
A treaty that has been executed

2323
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,460
Even if abandoned

2324
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,460
Abandonment in form

2325
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,460
The event that has been executed

2326
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,460
Unable to return to the state of non-execution

2327
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,460
In other words

2328
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:21,460
The Maguan Treaty abandons Taiwan and Penghu to Japan

2329
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:22,460
Abandoned

2330
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,460
Completed

2331
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,460
It's over after the transfer

2332
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,460
After that, even if the Maguan Treaty is abolished

2333
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:29,460
Taiwan and Penghu's sovereignty

2334
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,460
Will not return to the Republic of China because of this

2335
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,460
This is the basic principle of international law

2336
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:38,460
Because it is based on the requirements of legal stability

2337
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:39,460
Of course, why is this?

2338
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,460
Because

2339
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,460
Because in fact, between the international

2340
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,460
Sometimes in the past

2341
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,460
Often because of some war

2342
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,460
There is a problem of territorial partition between each other

2343
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:49,460
So the territory is partitioned

2344
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,460
If it's just between two countries

2345
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,460
It doesn't matter if you fight

2346
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,460
Sometimes it will be related to the third country

2347
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,460
Or even the fourth country, the fifth country

2348
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,460
In this case

2349
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,460
Your territory

2350
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:01,460
A piece of territory may be partitioned in the middle

2351
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:02,460
Turn around

2352
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,460
Turn a few hands

2353
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:07,460
If you are in the back

2354
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,460
For example, if the A country and the B country fight

2355
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,460
Then partition a piece of land

2356
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,460
Then fight a few battles

2357
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:14,460
Then the land was later transferred to the F country

2358
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,460
Then if later

2359
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,460
Between the A country and the B country

2360
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:21,460
If the treaty on this piece of land was abolished

2361
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:24,460
Assuming that you can make the territory return to its original state

2362
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,460
Isn't the territory in the hands of the F country now?

2363
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,460
How do you return to its original state?

2364
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,460
So this is to say

2365
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,460
Because it is based on the principle of legal stability

2366
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,460
So like this

2367
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,460
You have already

2368
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,460
The territory has been partitioned

2369
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,460
You can't say

2370
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,460
Because you restore today

2371
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,460
That is to say

2372
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:43,460
This treaty

2373
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,460
The previous treaty was abolished

2374
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,460
Then restore to its original state

2375
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,460
and so

2376
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,460
After the Maguan Treaty was abolished

2377
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:52,460
Then Taiwan and Hong Kong

2378
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,460
Returned to the Republic of China

2379
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,460
This statement

2380
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,460
It's not correct in law

2381
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,460
It doesn't make sense in international law

2382
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:01,460
But this is one of the sayings of the Republic of China

2383
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,460
And then in 1954

2384
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,460
The Republic of China signed with the United States

2385
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,460
Sino-US Joint Transparency Treaty

2386
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,460
What about the treaty?

2387
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,460
It was abolished on March 3

2388
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,460
March 3 next year

2389
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,460
Article 2 of the Treaty

2390
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,460
Taiwan and Penghu are listed as

2391
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,460
Territory controlled by the Republic of China

2392
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:20,460
In the English version, it is Territory

2393
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,460
In fact, Territory is mainly in this place

2394
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,460
Is a region controlled by a regime

2395
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,460
In the Chinese version, it is translated as territory

2396
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,460
This is a hint of sovereignty

2397
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,460
In fact, the Republic of China

2398
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,460
Do things like this in many places

2399
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,460
In fact, it's just a field

2400
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,460
Just say where you actually control

2401
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,460
It's not about sovereignty

2402
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:42,460
Sovereignty belongs to you

2403
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:43,460
But the Republic of China

2404
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:46,460
He will do it in translation

2405
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,460
Then make you feel

2406
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,460
Yeah, does that mean sovereignty?

2407
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,460
Belongs to the Republic of China

2408
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,460
In fact, the United States is also very clear about this

2409
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:54,460
So they are in

2410
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,460
The Senate approved the treaty and said directly

2411
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,460
This treaty

2412
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,460
Will not change the status of Taiwan's legal status

2413
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,460
Uncertain state

2414
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,460
On December 5, 1971

2415
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,460
The United Nations General Assembly resolution

2416
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,460
The Republic of China regime

2417
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,460
Listed as a representative of the Republic of China

2418
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,460
But this resolution did not mention

2419
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,460
Taiwan and Penghu belong to

2420
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,460
Then expelled from the United Nations

2421
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,460
Is the regime of the Republic of China

2422
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,460
Not Taiwan

2423
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,460
So someone said

2424
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,460
Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations

2425
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,460
This is not the case

2426
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,460
Because Taiwan has never been

2427
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,460
Never entered the United Nations

2428
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:29,460
The Republic of China entered the United Nations in 1945

2429
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,460
Then the Republic of China

2430
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,460
At that time he was China

2431
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,460
Because at that time

2432
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,460
The regime of the People's Republic of China did not exist

2433
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,460
Is the regime of the Republic of China

2434
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:41,460
Is the government of the Republic of China

2435
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,460
Then in 1972

2436
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:44,460
On September 29, Japan changed

2437
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:47,460
The regime of the People's Republic of China is the government of China

2438
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:51,460
So he did not memorize the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2439
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:52,460
In this case

2440
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:53,460
For Japan

2441
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:56,460
Taiwan and Penghu residents are no longer regarded as citizens of the Republic of China

2442
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,460
But residents under the Taiwan Autonomous Region

2443
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,460
In fact, this later

2444
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,460
Extended all the way to

2445
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,460
Just recently

2446
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:08,460
We have heard some news

2447
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:09,460
That is, like Japan

2448
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:12,460
Now Taiwan is in Japan

2449
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,460
If he wants to register

2450
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,460
Or what other registration

2451
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,460
His birthplace

2452
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,460
Something like that

2453
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,460
You can write Taiwan directly now

2454
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,460
Instead of writing China

2455
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,460
So this concept

2456
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,460
Just came out

2457
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,460
OK

2458
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,460
Then in 1979

2459
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:31,460
On January 1, the United States changed

2460
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:35,460
The regime of the People's Republic of China is the government of China

2461
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,460
On April 10, the same year

2462
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,460
Taiwan Relations Act was signed

2463
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:42,460
Expired on January 1, 1979

2464
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:43,460
But the purpose is to maintain

2465
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:46,460
Non-official relations between the United States and Taiwan Penghu residents

2466
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:49,460
Then it also admitted that

2467
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:52,460
The United States originally recognized the Republic of China

2468
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,460
This thing

2469
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,460
Now it's the Taiwan Autonomous Region

2470
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:58,460
And this Autonomous Region can be replaced

2471
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,460
Look at the part of Jinma

2472
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:03,460
This award is

2473
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,460
The point is that these places

2474
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:09,460
Jinma has always been the coast island of mainland China

2475
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:12,460
Then he is different from the legal status of Taiwan Penghu

2476
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,460
Because the biggest difference is

2477
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:17,460
Never been cut

2478
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,460
Then there is no

2479
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,460
This one behind

2480
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:24,460
The dispute on the territorial settlement treaty

2481
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:26,460
So Jinmen Mazu

2482
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:29,460
It's always the territory of China

2483
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,460
Then the UK is the same

2484
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,460
Can I ask a question?

2485
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:36,460
Just go back to the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2486
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,460
I agree with your point

2487
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,460
You said that the defeated country

2488
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,460
Because he surrendered

2489
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:46,460
So he signed the treaty

2490
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:49,460
Then put the original

2491
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,460
The original territory

2492
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,460
Must give up

2493
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,460
Transfer to

2494
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,460
Give up this territory

2495
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,460
That means

2496
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:59,460
This territory will be returned to

2497
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,460
Originally he

2498
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:03,460
Occupied that country

2499
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:04,460
I agree

2500
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,460
But my question is

2501
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,460
If according to this logic

2502
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:11,460
Why did Japan sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty with the Republic of China?

2503
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,460
When he signed the treaty

2504
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:15,460
He is with all

2505
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:18,460
The 48 countries that won

2506
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,460
All signed

2507
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,460
I said I gave up Taiwan Pengjin

2508
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,460
I give up every one

2509
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,460
With the United States

2510
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,460
With France

2511
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,460
He has such a clause

2512
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:27,460
Or he is only

2513
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:31,460
For the Sino-Japanese Treaty signed with the Republic of China

2514
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,460
He also mentioned

2515
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,460
I give up the sovereignty of Taiwan Pengjin

2516
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:38,460
Then in the treaty

2517
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,460
There is already

2518
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,460
Including Japan's abandonment of Taiwan Pengjin

2519
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,460
Part

2520
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:44,460
So he is now

2521
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,460
Between Japan and the Republic of China

2522
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:47,460
In addition

2523
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,460
This thing is because of China

2524
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:50,460
Because at that time

2525
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,460
China because of the issue of representative rights

2526
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,460
So there is no way to sign

2527
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,460
Sino-Japanese Treaty

2528
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:58,460
But the war between China and Japan

2529
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,460
Still have to end

2530
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,460
So Japan is with

2531
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:04,460
The Chinese representative government he recognized

2532
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,460
Signed this Sino-Japanese Treaty

2533
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,460
There is a very important part in this

2534
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,460
Is to say

2535
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:12,460
Is the part about Taiwan and Pengjin

2536
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,460
That part about Taiwan and Pengjin

2537
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,460
He is here

2538
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:18,460
Especially with the Republic of China

2539
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:19,460
Signed this thing

2540
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:20,460
To say OK

2541
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,460
Both sides admit

2542
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:24,460
Japan has been in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2543
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,460
Did you give up this part of the sovereignty?

2544
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:27,460
That's it

2545
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,460
So actually it should be said

2546
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:30,460
That is to say, for Japan

2547
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:31,460
He is with all the countries

2548
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:33,460
About Taiwan and Pengjin

2549
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:37,460
Part of the territory

2550
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:38,460
The conditions are the same

2551
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:40,460
It's all Japan

2552
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,460
Gave up the sovereignty of Taiwan Pengjin

2553
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,460
It's all the same thing here

2554
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:45,460
I have a

2555
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,460
I have a metaphor, OK?

2556
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,460
Because I think you are

2557
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,460
It seems to make sense

2558
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:52,460
But there is a little bit of no sense

2559
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:54,460
I said it was a common sense

2560
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,460
Suppose there is a pair

2561
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,460
There is a

2562
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:00,460
There is a person who went to rob

2563
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,460
A robbed B's child

2564
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,460
And then a few years later

2565
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:05,460
B retaliated

2566
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,460
Then B

2567
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,460
He has a bigger fist

2568
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,460
He won the war

2569
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:12,460
And now

2570
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,460
He wants to deal with this now

2571
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,460
The thing about the kid who was robbed

2572
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:18,460
He signed a contract

2573
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,460
Then according to your statement

2574
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:21,460
It's a bit like A signed

2575
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:23,460
Signed this contract with B

2576
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,460
In the contract

2577
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:26,460
He just said he gave up this kid

2578
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:27,460
He didn't say this kid

2579
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:29,460
Must belong to B

2580
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,460
I think you gave me this

2581
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:32,460
The logic of the deduction is like that

2582
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,460
So what I mean is

2583
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,460
So why did he follow

2584
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,460
So the first thing is

2585
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:39,460
He signed this thing with B

2586
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:42,460
A and B have such behavior

2587
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,460
Is a

2588
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,460
A has been established in a

2589
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,460
Under a very special relationship

2590
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:50,460
The two of them will do it again

2591
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,460
A contract like this

2592
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,460
No, there is no special relationship

2593
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,460
Because in fact they are all

2594
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,460
They are all

2595
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:59,460
There is a war with Japan

2596
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,460
So for Japan

2597
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:01,460
He just wants to solve this problem

2598
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,460
So I have to sign this

2599
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,460
Basically

2600
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:06,460
The content of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2601
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:07,460
Originally

2602
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,460
Originally

2603
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,460
Basically the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2604
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,460
Originally

2605
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,460
I think

2606
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,460
Let's leave this question

2607
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,460
Let's discuss it in the last Q&A

2608
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,460
Because this is more like a question of interpretation

2609
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,460
This is not an objective fact

2610
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,460
Just answer it

2611
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,460
Because I think

2612
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:24,460
In fact, the objective fact is also very simple

2613
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:25,460
Basically

2614
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,460
For Japan

2615
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:27,460
Sino-Japanese Treaty

2616
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,460
Why did he sign this thing

2617
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,460
Because actually the original Sino-Japanese Treaty

2618
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:31,460
The original draft is not like this

2619
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:32,460
The original draft is not like this

2620
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,460
The original content of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2621
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,460
In fact, it is not much different from the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2622
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,460
But then I found out

2623
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:40,460
Why repeat these things

2624
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,460
Because in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2625
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,460
Article 26

2626
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:46,460
It directly says that Japan

2627
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,460
In the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2628
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,460
For example, within two years

2629
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:52,460
You can sign with other countries

2630
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,460
That is, the content of the treaty is consistent

2631
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,460
Some other contracts that are similar to the content of the treaty

2632
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:00,460
To end the state of war between each other

2633
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:01,460
So for Japan

2634
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,460
He signed this with the Republic of China

2635
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:05,460
Because Japan is not only signed with the Republic of China

2636
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:06,460
He also signed with India

2637
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,460
And with

2638
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,460
And some other countries

2639
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,460
Also signed contracts

2640
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:13,460
But when signing these contracts

2641
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,460
In fact, it is

2642
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,460
It's like adding up

2643
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,460
Some of the things in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2644
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,460
So for Japan

2645
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:21,460
He just didn't sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2646
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,460
Or signed the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2647
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,460
But no approved countries

2648
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,460
In addition to signing the treaty

2649
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:28,460
And then go

2650
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,460
Officially confirm the state of war between each other

2651
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,460
That's it

2652
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:32,460
That

2653
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:33,460
The current situation is that

2654
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,460
Because now there is a point

2655
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:37,460
Japan signed with the Republic of China today

2656
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,460
This thing

2657
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,460
With Japan

2658
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:41,460
He signed in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2659
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,460
He just said

2660
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:43,460
I have already made it very clear

2661
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:44,460
China also admitted

2662
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:46,460
This is the arrangement of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2663
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:47,460
Republic of China

2664
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,460
He also admitted

2665
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,460
This is how the Sino-Japanese Treaty is handled

2666
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,460
He can't do it here

2667
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,460
Further processing

2668
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,460
In fact, it is the Republic of China

2669
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,460
I admit

2670
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:57,460
That's it

2671
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,460
The result is like this

2672
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,460
I can't handle it anymore

2673
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,460
Because Japan and the Republic of China

2674
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:04,460
He can't sign anything else

2675
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,460
Because Japan has given up

2676
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,460
In fact, he has given up

2677
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,460
He just told the Republic of China

2678
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:10,460
He told the Republic of China

2679
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,460
I have given up these things

2680
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,460
You can't ask me for anything anymore

2681
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:15,460
I can't give you anything

2682
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,460
So the Republic of China said

2683
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,460
OK, I admit

2684
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,460
I admit that you have given up here

2685
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,460
OK

2686
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,460
I can't ask you for anything

2687
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,460
You can't give me anything anymore

2688
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,460
In Japan

2689
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,460
Through this form

2690
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,460
Off the hook

2691
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:28,460
For example

2692
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,460
Yes, I am already in the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2693
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,460
I have already given up on the sovereignty of Taiwan

2694
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:33,460
To the world

2695
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,460
Then

2696
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:35,460
It's not my business anymore

2697
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,460
None of my business

2698
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:38,460
Then I signed with the Republic of China today

2699
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,460
Make it clear

2700
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:41,460
Although this place is now occupied

2701
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:43,460
But I have already said

2702
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,460
I have already given up on this thing

2703
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:45,460
I have already given up

2704
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:46,460
It's none of my business

2705
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,460
You can't ask me for anything

2706
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:50,460
So this is actually the effect of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2707
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:51,460
That is

2708
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,460
This kind of blood

2709
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,460
Is to let China

2710
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:55,460
The Republic of China can't do anything with Japan

2711
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,460
The Republic of China can only admit

2712
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,460
OK

2713
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,460
It's over like this

2714
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,460
The situation is like this

2715
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:04,460
In fact, the Republic of China also thinks

2716
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,460
The status of Taiwan is not necessarily better

2717
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,460
It's not because of the Sino-Japanese Treaty

2718
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,460
Signed like this

2719
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:10,460
Then I felt

2720
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,460
Taiwan is like this

2721
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,460
Then I went back to him again

2722
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:13,460
Of course

2723
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,460
How he talks to the Taiwanese

2724
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,460
That's another thing

2725
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:19,460
But the Republic of China is very clear about this

2726
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:21,460
OK

2727
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,460
That

2728
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:25,460
So I say this conclusion

2729
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:27,460
This part of Taiwan and Penghu

2730
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,460
This is the first place in the law

2731
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:29,460
The ownership of sovereignty is not decided

2732
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,460
Does not belong to any country

2733
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:32,460
But this is also special

2734
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,460
Taiwan and Penghu are basically

2735
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,460
Basically speaking

2736
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,460
Before giving up in Japan

2737
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:38,460
Sovereignty belongs to Japan

2738
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,460
But it is the colonial territory of Japan

2739
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,460
So basically speaking

2740
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,460
After World War II

2741
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:46,460
The so-called international consensus

2742
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:47,460
The colonial territory is basically

2743
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,460
To give the people of the colonial territory the right to self-determination

2744
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:51,460
So from this perspective

2745
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:52,460
Taiwan and Penghu

2746
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:55,460
In its original status as a colonial territory

2747
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:56,460
He has the right

2748
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,460
Taiwanese citizens have the right to decide to return

2749
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,460
That part of China

2750
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,460
The regime of the Republic of China did not get it

2751
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,460
The People's Republic of China regime

2752
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,460
The regime of the Republic of China did not get it

2753
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,460
So he can't claim

2754
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:08,460
By inheriting the Republic of China

2755
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,460
To obtain this sovereignty

2756
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:13,460
Some people claim that Taiwan and Penghu

2757
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,460
Sovereignty now belongs to the United States

2758
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:16,460
But the United States is just one of the allies

2759
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:18,460
There is no international document

2760
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,460
Hand Taiwan's sovereignty over to the United States

2761
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:21,460
So there is no such thing

2762
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,460
Someone else said

2763
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,460
Taiwan's sovereignty now belongs to the allies

2764
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:26,460
This is also a joke

2765
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,460
because

2766
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:30,460
The allied forces only carry out military occupation authorization

2767
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:32,460
That's the same thing in the Sino-Taiwan Treaty

2768
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:33,460
Japan just gave up

2769
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:36,460
Did not say that the sovereignty was transferred to the allied forces

2770
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,460
So Taiwan and Penghu sovereignty

2771
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,460
It will not belong to the allied forces

2772
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,460
Someone else said

2773
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,460
Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to the people of Taiwan

2774
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,460
But in fact, territorial sovereignty

2775
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,460
Only the country can claim

2776
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,460
and so

2777
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,460
Can't mix with national sovereignty

2778
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:52,460
The current status of self-determination is

2779
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,460
The Republic of China regime

2780
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,460
Under the authorization of the allied forces

2781
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,460
Established occupation self-government institutions

2782
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,460
Taiwan's own authorities

2783
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,460
Occupying

2784
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,460
In governance

2785
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:03,460
That allied force established

2786
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,460
The Republic of China established this occupation self-government institution

2787
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,460
At first it was the so-called Taiwan Provincial Executive Office

2788
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,460
Later it became the Taiwan Provincial Government

2789
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:11,460
Then later

2790
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:14,460
Because of a series of new provinces

2791
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,460
After the Dong Province and the Jin Province

2792
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,460
The main functions and roles

2793
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:19,460
Basically

2794
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:23,460
Have been taken over by the central government of the Republic of China regime

2795
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:25,460
So we see

2796
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:27,460
It was originally the Taiwan Province

2797
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:29,460
The so-called Taiwan Province of the Republic of China

2798
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,460
Later, Taipei City became the Executive Office

2799
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,460
The Executive Yuan directly managed

2800
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:34,460
Later, Kaohsiung City came out

2801
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:36,460
And now it has become a six-capital city

2802
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:38,460
That basically

2803
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:42,460
Some of these from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China

2804
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,460
These so-called Executive Offices

2805
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,460
Basically equal to the Republic of China

2806
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:48,460
It has taken all its governance

2807
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:50,460
In their own hands

2808
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:51,460
The Taiwan Provincial Government

2809
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,460
Basically speaking

2810
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:53,460
Already

2811
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,460
Degraded

2812
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:55,460
And now

2813
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:58,460
The personnel has been reorganized to the National Development and Reform Commission

2814
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:00,460
So in fact, the whole Taiwan

2815
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,460
Now the whole governance

2816
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,460
It's the Republic of China regime itself

2817
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,460
In operation

2818
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:07,460
OK

2819
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:08,460
That's basically the part of the Ma group

2820
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,460
The rule of law has always been China

2821
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,460
What about the governance part?

2822
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,460
It's the Republic of China regime

2823
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:15,460
It's the Chinese regime

2824
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:17,460
One of the two major regimes

2825
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:18,460
China

2826
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:19,460
The Republic of China regime

2827
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:20,460
Now it is governed

2828
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,460
So that's the way it is

2829
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,460
That is

2830
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:25,460
To show off

2831
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,460
It's China

2832
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,460
It's two regimes

2833
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,460
The two regimes have their own jurisdiction

2834
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:29,460
Different ranges

2835
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:30,460
These are all belong to

2836
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:31,460
Mainland China

2837
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:32,460
Hong Kong and Macau

2838
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,460
The Ma group is the so-called Chinese territory

2839
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,460
The part of the sovereign territory

2840
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:37,460
That's another piece

2841
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:40,460
It is the Allied Forces that authorizes the Republic of China regime

2842
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,460
Establish the Allied Forces Occupation Organization

2843
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:44,460
Then come to govern

2844
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,460
Taiwan and Penghu

2845
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:47,460
That is currently the status of the sovereign

2846
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,460
That governance

2847
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:49,460
The power comes from the Allied Forces

2848
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:51,460
All the way down

2849
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:52,460
That is to say

2850
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,460
The Allied Forces were the victors

2851
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:55,460
The victor

2852
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,460
The victor is the loser

2853
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:01,460
Occupy the territory

2854
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:03,460
And then because of the loser

2855
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,460
After giving up the territory

2856
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:05,460
but

2857
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,460
The final disposal of its territory is not certain

2858
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:09,460
So people still maintain

2859
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:11,460
A state of continued management

2860
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:13,460
So this is the current legal status

2861
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:15,460
Of course this is my research

2862
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:16,460
That

2863
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:19,460
Maybe someone has other different opinions

2864
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:20,460
But basically

2865
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,460
This is from me

2866
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:23,460
I personally from the perspective of international law

2867
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:26,460
The results of my research

2868
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,460
OK

2869
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,460
Then

2870
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:31,460
Taiwan is a country

2871
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:32,460
In fact, this statement

2872
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,460
Some people think it is already

2873
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,460
Some people say that in 1949

2874
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,460
Taiwan is already a country

2875
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,460
but

2876
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:40,460
This is a problem

2877
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,460
That is to say

2878
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:43,460
At that time, Taiwan's sovereignty was still Japan

2879
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,460
How do you use Taiwan to build a country

2880
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:47,460
This is a very strange thing

2881
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:48,460
Another year

2882
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,460
On October 25, 1971

2883
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,460
Also represented China in the United Nations

2884
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:54,460
So if you say you built a country in 1949

2885
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,460
That one

2886
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:57,460
If it's not China

2887
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,460
How do you represent China in the United Nations

2888
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:02,460
And another thing is

2889
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:03,460
With him

2890
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,460
Build a country with China

2891
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,460
Still regard it as China

2892
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,460
At least before October 25, 1971

2893
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:09,460
The United States was before 1979

2894
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:10,460
Right?

2895
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:11,460
Still think

2896
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:12,460
It represents China

2897
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,460
It's all China

2898
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:15,460
Then there are people who claim that

2899
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:16,460
After giving up because of Japan

2900
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:17,460
Taiwan

2901
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:18,460
Then it becomes an unoccupied territory

2902
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:19,460
So you can occupy an unoccupied territory

2903
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,460
Then it becomes its territory

2904
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:22,460
But now there is a problem

2905
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:23,460
That is to say

2906
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:24,460
On the International Law

2907
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,460
For the so-called unoccupied land

2908
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,460
There is a strict requirement

2909
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:27,460
Now the so-called unoccupied land

2910
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:31,460
It is the so-called uninhabited island that can claim to occupy the unoccupied land

2911
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:32,460
Or no one

2912
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,460
Long-term residence

2913
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:35,460
That place

2914
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:36,460
That place will become

2915
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:37,460
Unoccupied land

2916
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:38,460
Appropriate object

2917
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,460
Then we know that

2918
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,460
In fact, Taiwan and Penghu

2919
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:44,460
In fact, there are millions of people on it for a long time

2920
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:46,460
Millions of people now live on it

2921
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,460
Then there are social

2922
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:49,460
Social life

2923
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:51,460
Organized operation

2924
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:52,460
There is economic life

2925
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:53,460
So it won't be

2926
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:54,460
It won't be an uninhabited island

2927
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:56,460
So you can't use it

2928
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,460
The sovereignty of the unoccupied land

2929
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,460
The Republic of China regime

2930
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,460
Has not yet announced the establishment of a new country

2931
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:03,460
So it's all the same

2932
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,460
Same as above

2933
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:07,460
It's all the same in the United Nations

2934
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,460
Some people say that in 1971

2935
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:11,460
The Republic of China was kicked out of the United Nations

2936
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:12,460
After the founding of the country

2937
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,460
This is also very interesting

2938
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,460
In fact, it is still the same

2939
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,460
It has never been announced

2940
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:18,460
Has not yet announced the establishment of a new country

2941
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:19,460
Then

2942
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:21,460
In fact, the Republic of China regime in 1979

2943
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,460
After being kicked out of the United Nations

2944
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:24,460
The so-called Republic of China

2945
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,460
After being kicked out of the United Nations

2946
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:26,460
In fact, there are many countries

2947
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,460
Admit that he is the representative of China

2948
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,460
Right

2949
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:29,460
Like the United States

2950
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:30,460
It was only changed in 1979

2951
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:31,460
Panama

2952
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:33,460
It was only over in 2017

2953
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,460
Right

2954
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,460
So there are many countries

2955
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,460
Think he is the Chinese regime

2956
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:39,460
So he never established

2957
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:42,460
A new country that is different from China

2958
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:45,460
Never did this thing

2959
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:46,460
It's all the same

2960
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,460
Then someone else said

2961
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:48,460
In 1996

2962
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:51,460
The presidential election of the Republic of China regime

2963
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,460
So the founding of the country

2964
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:54,460
This is also very interesting

2965
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:55,460
Still the same

2966
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,460
The same questions are all the same

2967
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:57,460
Another one is

2968
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:58,460
The candidate did not say

2969
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:00,460
Announce the establishment of a new country

2970
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:02,460
In 1996

2971
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:05,460
The presidential election of the Republic of China regime

2972
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:06,460
Li Denghui was elected

2973
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:07,460
Li Denghui

2974
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:10,460
At that time, the Chinese Kuomintang was the chairman

2975
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:11,460
Then we all know that the Chinese Kuomintang

2976
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:14,460
Is a regime that advocates unification

2977
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:19,460
So the chairman of a regime that advocates unification

2978
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:21,460
Elected president

2979
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,460
How could you

2980
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:23,460
Because he elected the president

2981
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:26,460
Then establish a country

2982
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:28,460
This is also incomprehensible

2983
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:29,460
The other point is

2984
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:30,460
You can't choose

2985
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:33,460
The president of the A country to establish the B country

2986
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:37,460
Is there such an example in history?

2987
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:39,460
Then someone else said

2988
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,460
The Chinese Kuomintang did not work before

2989
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,460
Then change to the Democratic Party

2990
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,460
Then someone said

2991
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:47,460
In 2000, 2004, Chen Shui-bian was elected

2992
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,460
Basically the same as before

2993
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:49,460
Chen Shui-bian was elected

2994
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:52,460
He did not advocate the establishment of a new country

2995
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,460
The other important thing is

2996
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:57,460
In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou was elected president

2997
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,460
If today

2998
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:02,460
Chen Shui-bian elected the president of the Republic of China

2999
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:05,460
He will represent the establishment of the Republic of Taiwan

3000
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:08,460
Today, when Ma Ying-jeou was elected president

3001
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,460
What about the previous Republic of Taiwan?

3002
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:12,460
Is there such a thing as extinction?

3003
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:14,460
So this is a very strange statement

3004
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,460
It is impossible for you to say

3005
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:17,460
Which one to choose

3006
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,460
To be the leader of a certain regime

3007
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,460
To establish another country

3008
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:23,460
That is incomprehensible

3009
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:24,460
Then someone said

3010
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,460
Because there is no complete governance

3011
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,460
So Chen Shui-bian has no complete governance

3012
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,460
So that doesn't count

3013
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:32,460
In 2016, Tsai Ing-wen took over

3014
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,460
Taiwan is the same

3015
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:34,460
It's all the same in front

3016
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:36,460
These are all the same problems

3017
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,460
Have appeared

3018
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:38,460
In addition, by taking over

3019
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:39,460
To establish another country

3020
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:41,460
There is no potential

3021
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:45,460
Then this is what I just said

3022
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:47,460
Panama changed its name to the People's Republic of China regime

3023
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:49,460
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China is still talking about

3024
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:51,460
The two countries are more than a century apart

3025
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,460
So even if Tsai Ing-wen's regime

3026
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:55,460
Tsai Ing-wen as president

3027
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,460
This regime of the People's Republic of China

3028
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,460
He is still

3029
01:44:57,460 --> 01:45:00,460
The same relationship with other countries

3030
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,460
All the way back to China

3031
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:03,460
Relations with other countries

3032
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:05,460
So it won't be another country

3033
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:08,460
So Taiwan is not a country yet

3034
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:12,460
Then this situation is more direct

3035
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:15,460
For example, the so-called diplomatic countries of the People's Republic of China

3036
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,460
This is Fan Ligang

3037
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:17,460
There is that website below

3038
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:19,460
This is actually

3039
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:21,460
On the official website of Fan Ligang

3040
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,460
The national flag of the People's Republic of China is written on the side of China

3041
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,460
Now many people say this is the national flag of Taiwan

3042
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:29,460
Then another example is Honduras

3043
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:30,460
It's the same

3044
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,460
China

3045
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,460
Taiwan is written behind

3046
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:33,460
Taiwan is written behind

3047
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:36,460
What does Taiwan mean?

3048
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,460
Is China equal to Taiwan?

3049
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,460
China on Taiwan

3050
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:40,460
China in Taiwan

3051
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,460
I don't know

3052
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,460
China is in Taiwan

3053
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:43,460
China is in Taiwan

3054
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,460
China is Taiwan

3055
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:45,460
I don't know

3056
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:48,460
He used this form to express

3057
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,460
Then another like Guatemala

3058
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,460
It's the same

3059
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:51,460
He also wrote like this

3060
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,460
So this is actually

3061
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,460
You know he

3062
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,460
Taiwan's current state

3063
01:45:58,460 --> 01:45:59,460
Other countries

3064
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,460
Even the diplomatic countries of the People's Republic of China

3065
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:03,460
When dealing with Taiwan

3066
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:04,460
He still has no way

3067
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:06,460
Take the piece of China

3068
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,460
So if you want to say

3069
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,460
Taiwan is already

3070
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:11,460
A sovereign independent country

3071
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:13,460
That has nothing to do with the country

3072
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,460
You will find that in fact

3073
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:16,460
Not so much

3074
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,460
OK

3075
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,460
In the future

3076
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:21,460
What should I do?

3077
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,460
How to build

3078
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,460
Actually I want to say

3079
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:25,460
Sorry

3080
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,460
We can end

3081
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,460
In Taiwan's current history

3082
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,460
Is the current international law positioning?

3083
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,460
Because it's too long

3084
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,460
Yes

3085
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:32,460
OK

3086
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:33,460
Then let's go back

3087
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,460
You just wrote a line of red paper

3088
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,460
Taiwan is not a country now

3089
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:38,460
This page is good

3090
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:39,460
OK

3091
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,460
Sorry

3092
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:43,460
I want to interrupt you

3093
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,460
Because today is really too long

3094
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,460
I think this is a very conclusive conclusion

3095
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,460
Just take away

3096
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,460
Based on international law

3097
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:53,460
Taiwan is not a country now

3098
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,460
If we have a chance

3099
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:57,460
You can

3100
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:59,460
We are looking for you to talk about this

3101
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:00,460
The last part

3102
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:01,460
That is

3103
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:02,460
I'm sorry

3104
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:03,460
It's okay

3105
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:04,460
This thing is really

3106
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:05,460
I originally wanted to

3107
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:06,460
It's complicated

3108
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,460
I originally wanted to cut it short

3109
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:09,460
I found out

3110
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:10,460
It seems to be impossible

3111
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:11,460
OK

3112
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:13,460
OK

3113
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,460
Before we start asking questions

3114
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:16,460
Still the same

3115
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:17,460
Please turn on the microphone

3116
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:18,460
Then we applaud again

3117
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:19,460
Thank you, Shen Feng

3118
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:20,460
Thank you

3119
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:23,460
Thank you

3120
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:25,460
OK

3121
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,460
Do you have any questions?

3122
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,460
Or comment?

3123
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:30,460
Because I just interrupted

3124
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,460
There may be one or two questions

3125
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,460
That can be discussed now

3126
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,460
Does anyone want to mention it?

3127
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:39,460
That Sino-Japanese contract

3128
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:43,460
Yes, but he

3129
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:49,460
Because after he finished asking

3130
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:50,460
It's been a long time

3131
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,460
Maybe there is an answer

3132
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,460
Let's just ask

3133
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:54,460
Who else has any questions now?

3134
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:55,460
Do you want to mention it?

3135
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:57,460
Just based on

3136
01:47:57,460 --> 01:47:58,460
After listening to everything

3137
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,460
Is there anyone who wants to ask a question?

3138
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:05,460
OK

3139
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,460
That means today's speech

3140
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:07,460
I can ask

3141
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:08,460
OK

3142
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:09,460
You say

3143
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,460
In fact, it is

3144
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,460
In the count

3145
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:12,460
Two

3146
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,460
PowerPoint

3147
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:15,460
I already have a little lost

3148
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:16,460
You are here

3149
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,460
For example, on this PowerPoint

3150
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:19,460
It says

3151
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,460
Is Taiwan already a country?

3152
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,460
Your Taiwan here

3153
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:25,460
This territory

3154
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,460
The people on this territory

3155
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,460
Republic of China government

3156
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,460
Democratic Progressive Party government

3157
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:32,460
What is Taiwan here?

3158
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,460
This Taiwan

3159
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,460
In fact, it is not

3160
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:37,460
Democratic Progressive Party government

3161
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:38,460
Those things

3162
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:39,460
But just say

3163
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:40,460
Now in Taiwan

3164
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,460
Is this piece

3165
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:44,460
Taiwan

3166
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:45,460
With the island of Taiwan

3167
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,460
With the surrounding area

3168
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:48,460
With

3169
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:51,460
Penghu Islands

3170
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,460
On this piece

3171
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:55,460
These lands

3172
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:56,460
With the group

3173
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:57,460
The group of people above

3174
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:58,460
With the above

3175
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,460
The current governance

3176
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:01,460
That regime

3177
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:02,460
With this

3178
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:03,460
Wrap it up like this

3179
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:04,460
This piece

3180
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:05,460
This thing

3181
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,460
Is it a country?

3182
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:08,460
Is this territory

3183
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:09,460
This people

3184
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,460
This above

3185
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,460
Governance

3186
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:13,460
Government

3187
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:14,460
Government

3188
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:15,460
Government

3189
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:16,460
This government

3190
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,460
This regime

3191
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:19,460
I'm not talking about the government

3192
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:20,460
Is the governing regime above

3193
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:21,460
Will he

3194
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:22,460
Is he

3195
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:23,460
Is it

3196
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:24,460
Can this be regarded as a country?

3197
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:25,460
Is it a country?

3198
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:27,460
Is it a country on the international community?

3199
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:29,460
Then you think

3200
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,460
It's not a country

3201
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,460
The reason is because of this territory

3202
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,460
And the people above

3203
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:36,460
Still undetermined

3204
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:39,460
The territory is undetermined

3205
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:42,460
The territory is undetermined

3206
01:49:42,460 --> 01:49:43,460
Because the territory belongs

3207
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:45,460
Which country does it belong to?

3208
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,460
Unknown

3209
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:47,460
The territory is undetermined

3210
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,460
Then above this

3211
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,460
Republic of China regime

3212
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:53,460
Above this

3213
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,460
Republic of China regime itself

3214
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,460
He is the Chinese regime

3215
01:49:57,460 --> 01:49:58,460
If he says today

3216
01:49:58,460 --> 01:49:59,460
If it is to be determined

3217
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:01,460
If it is a country

3218
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:03,460
He is also a

3219
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,460
He is just China

3220
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,460
He won't be

3221
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:07,460
And there is no

3222
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:08,460
China with air sovereignty

3223
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:10,460
Because

3224
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:12,460
Air sovereignty does not belong to any country

3225
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:14,460
So even if he is a country

3226
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:15,460
Republic of China regime

3227
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:16,460
Even if it's a country

3228
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:18,460
He is also in China

3229
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:19,460
As a fugitive government

3230
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:21,460
In Taiwan

3231
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,460
Because

3232
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:24,460
The country he represents is China

3233
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:25,460
Not Taiwan

3234
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:27,460
Because

3235
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:28,460
Taiwan and Penghu's sovereignty

3236
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:29,460
Does not belong to him

3237
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,460
Of course, Taiwan and Penghu

3238
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,460
Is being governed by him

3239
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:32,460
That's right

3240
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:33,460
but

3241
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:34,460
He is not

3242
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:35,460
His territorial scope

3243
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:37,460
Does not include Taiwan and Penghu

3244
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:38,460
So now this

3245
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:39,460
A state

3246
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:40,460
That is to say, Taiwan and Penghu

3247
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,460
Now govern his

3248
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:42,460
That regime

3249
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:43,460
Does not have

3250
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:44,460
He is not a

3251
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:45,460
A country

3252
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:47,460
As a government

3253
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,460
To govern

3254
01:50:49,460 --> 01:50:50,460
He is not a

3255
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:51,460
A territorial form

3256
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:52,460
He is just a

3257
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,460
Manager role

3258
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:55,460
And his role as a manager

3259
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,460
Is

3260
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:57,460
In 1945

3261
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,460
Under the auspices of the Allied Forces

3262
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,460
What happened

3263
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:02,460
So now the situation is

3264
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:06,460
I'm talking about this part of Taiwan now

3265
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,460
The main thing is

3266
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:10,460
The part of the land and the people

3267
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:11,460
The regime above

3268
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:12,460
Because of his

3269
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:14,460
Chinese regime

3270
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,460
And China

3271
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:16,460
Never got

3272
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:17,460
Air sovereignty

3273
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:18,460
This matter

3274
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:20,460
Will become

3275
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:21,460
He has no way

3276
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:23,460
With Taiwan and Penghu

3277
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:24,460
This part

3278
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:26,460
Just become a country

3279
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:27,460
Because

3280
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:30,460
There is no territorial relationship between the two

3281
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:31,460
He is a

3282
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:33,460
Actually in

3283
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:35,460
A state of governance

3284
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:37,460
That

3285
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:39,460
There is another one here

3286
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,460
That participant has a question

3287
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:42,460
But in

3288
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:43,460
I'll ask him later

3289
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:44,460
Because he is typing

3290
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:45,460
But before asking

3291
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,460
I have a little comment

3292
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:47,460
To tell everyone

3293
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:48,460
Just

3294
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,460
I want to use

3295
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:52,460
Shen Feng and Kiki's conversation

3296
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:53,460
As an example

3297
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:55,460
Project Taira's purpose

3298
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:57,460
Is to make it possible

3299
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,460
In different parts of the world

3300
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:00,460
Because Kiki is actually in California now

3301
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:03,460
Shen Feng is in Edinburgh

3302
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:04,460
I personally think

3303
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,460
You can have a good conversation

3304
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:07,460
From different points of view

3305
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:09,460
Create a good study of Taiwan

3306
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,460
That

3307
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,460
Because I happen to know both of them

3308
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,460
So if you need

3309
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,460
Leave the other party's contact information

3310
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:15,460
You can ask me

3311
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:16,460
Or

3312
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:18,460
On Project Taira's website

3313
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:20,460
There should be members

3314
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:21,460
A personal page

3315
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:22,460
Can find a way to contact

3316
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:23,460
Then I really strongly

3317
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:25,460
You should continue to communicate

3318
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:26,460
Ok

3319
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:27,460
This is my comment

3320
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,460
Sorry

3321
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:29,460
What is the direct relationship with the researcher

3322
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:30,460
But

3323
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,460
This Liu

3324
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:33,460
He is Liu

3325
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:34,460
Say

3326
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,460
That old national law

3327
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:38,460
How can Taiwan and Penghu be considered a country?

3328
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:41,460
If Taiwan and Penghu finally broke up with the Republic of China regime

3329
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,460
Do you have to break up with Jinma?

3330
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:44,460
Then I think this is

3331
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:45,460
The part I just cut off

3332
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,460
right

3333
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:48,460
Yes yes yes

3334
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:49,460
Please continue

3335
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:50,460
Pick a few

3336
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,460
Just for this question

3337
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:53,460
See how you answer

3338
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:54,460
Ok

3339
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:56,460
Then we will

3340
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:58,460
Take a look

3341
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:01,460
So you see

3342
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:03,460
This thing still wants to talk about it

3343
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:07,460
Ok good

3344
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,460
That means everyone is very interested in this topic

3345
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:10,460
Yes yes yes

3346
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:11,460
Because the key is here

3347
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:12,460
You know the current state

3348
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:13,460
Of course you want to solve the problem

3349
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,460
right

3350
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:16,460
This is very normal

3351
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:17,460
Anyway

3352
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,460
Actually

3353
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:19,460
How does Taiwan become a country?

3354
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,460
In fact, I am talking now

3355
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,460
You want to be a country

3356
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:23,460
Your purpose is to become one

3357
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:25,460
Recognized by the international community

3358
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:29,460
A political entity that is willing to recognize the status of a country

3359
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:30,460
So the point is

3360
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:32,460
You have to follow the rules of international law

3361
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:36,460
Don't give birth to some other weird things yourself

3362
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:37,460
Ok

3363
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:38,460
That is to say, like these

3364
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:40,460
What I just talked about

3365
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:41,460
Those

3366
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,460
What I listed before

3367
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,460
Those

3368
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:44,460
All the way to 2016

3369
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:45,460
What is the previous administration

3370
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:46,460
These international law

3371
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:47,460
No potential

3372
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:49,460
So basically it doesn't make sense

3373
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:50,460
What else

3374
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:51,460
There are some

3375
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,460
Prove self-reliance

3376
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:53,460
Self-reliance

3377
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:54,460
Self-reliance

3378
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:55,460
These are all

3379
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:57,460
All involve the constitution

3380
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:59,460
I think it's from the constitution or the name

3381
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:01,460
This is what I said at the beginning

3382
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:03,460
There are some national characteristics

3383
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:05,460
How do you change it

3384
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:07,460
It won't change its essence

3385
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:08,460
So today

3386
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,460
No matter how you change your name

3387
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,460
No matter how you make a constitution

3388
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:11,460
It doesn't matter if it's abolished

3389
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:14,460
Will not affect the Chinese regime of the Republic of China

3390
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:17,460
Taiwan is not a country yet

3391
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:20,460
You can't build a country through constitution

3392
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:24,460
You have to build a country first and then constitution

3393
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:25,460
The other point is

3394
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,460
Taiwan's strength

3395
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,460
Of course there is no way to make international rules by yourself

3396
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:30,460
So it's according to the rules

3397
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:32,460
According to international rules

3398
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:33,460
In the international rules

3399
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:35,460
There are rules in international law

3400
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:36,460
One is the right of self-determination

3401
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,460
So the right of self-determination

3402
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:38,460
The constitution of the United Nations

3403
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:40,460
Then the civil rights

3404
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:41,460
Civil rights and political rights

3405
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:42,460
International Convention

3406
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:43,460
Economic, social, cultural rights

3407
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:44,460
International Convention

3408
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,460
All mentioned the right of self-determination

3409
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,460
For Taiwan

3410
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:51,460
The most important part is to decolonize

3411
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:52,460
Because I mentioned earlier

3412
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:56,460
Taiwan is the former colony of Japan

3413
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:57,460
In fact, in principle

3414
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:58,460
Taiwan as a former colony

3415
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,460
It should be

3416
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:02,460
Under the context of decolonization

3417
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:03,460
The right of self-determination

3418
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:06,460
And then build your own country

3419
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:07,460
In the U.N. Congress

3420
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:08,460
In fact, the U.N. Constitution itself

3421
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:09,460
It has

3422
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:10,460
There is a direct regulation

3423
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:12,460
To this decolonization part

3424
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:13,460
Decolonization is the U.N.

3425
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:16,460
One of the main goals in the Constitution

3426
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:17,460
In addition, the U.N. Convention

3427
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:18,460
It also mentions

3428
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,460
No. 1 and No. 4

3429
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,460
Say

3430
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,460
In the non-intellectual territory of the territory of the jurisdiction

3431
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:22,460
Or other

3432
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:23,460
Without reaching the territory of independence

3433
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,460
Steps must be taken

3434
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:25,460
Then everyone

3435
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,460
Help these democracies

3436
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:29,460
Be able to enjoy complete independence and freedom

3437
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:31,460
So this is also the right of self-determination

3438
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:34,460
The part of the U.N. Convention

3439
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,460
In the other U.N. Convention

3440
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:37,460
No. 1, 5, 4, 1

3441
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:38,460
It mentions

3442
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:40,460
When the right of self-determination is exercised

3443
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:41,460
Non-intellectual territory

3444
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:42,460
That's what it says

3445
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:43,460
In order to achieve independence

3446
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:45,460
These parts of the territory

3447
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:46,460
Can be achieved in the following way

3448
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,460
Complete self-determination

3449
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:49,460
First, become a sovereign independent country

3450
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:51,460
Second, become an independent country

3451
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:54,460
Or join an independent country

3452
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:55,460
The so-called sovereign independent country

3453
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:56,460
Needless to say

3454
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,460
Just become a country

3455
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,460
In addition, become an independent country

3456
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:00,460
This one

3457
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:01,460
In fact, you are also a country

3458
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:03,460
It's just that you may have some rights

3459
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:04,460
Some rights on sovereignty

3460
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:05,460
You just give it to other countries

3461
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,460
Help you to execute

3462
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,460
For example, like

3463
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:12,460
The United States used to have some

3464
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:15,460
According to the U.N. Convention

3465
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:17,460
Regulations on deportation

3466
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,460
Then give it to the U.S.

3467
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:20,460
Some of the Pacific Islands

3468
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:21,460
Some islands

3469
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:23,460
After they became independent

3470
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,460
They decided to be

3471
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:28,460
To become a free party in the United States

3472
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:30,460
That is to say, they put some rights

3473
01:56:30,460 --> 01:56:32,460
Just give it to the U.S.

3474
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:33,460
Maybe it's the diplomatic part

3475
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:35,460
Maybe it's the military part

3476
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:37,460
They might even be

3477
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:38,460
Use the U.S. dollar

3478
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:40,460
Something like this

3479
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:43,460
But these countries themselves still have

3480
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:46,460
These still have national rights

3481
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:49,460
The other one is to become an independent country

3482
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,460
So for Taiwan

3483
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:52,460
The choice after that is

3484
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:55,460
In fact, it is in the context of colonization

3485
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:56,460
Execute self-determination

3486
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,460
When it comes to self-determination

3487
01:56:57,460 --> 01:57:00,460
There are these options

3488
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:01,460
If Taiwan wants to become a country

3489
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:03,460
That is, when it comes to self-determination

3490
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:08,460
Choose to become a sovereign independent country

3491
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,460
What about the current state?

3492
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:11,460
In fact, it is important to say

3493
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,460
First define Taipeng as

3494
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:16,460
We are now under the arrangement of the Allied Forces

3495
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:17,460
Members of the Allied Forces

3496
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,460
For the Allied Forces

3497
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:22,460
The occupation of the occupation

3498
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,460
Occupation in governance

3499
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:24,460
So they belong to

3500
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:27,460
Not yet reached an independent territory

3501
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:28,460
If you go through the UN

3502
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:31,460
If the UN resolution 1514

3503
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:33,460
The UN member states have the obligation

3504
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:36,460
To assist Taiwan in gaining independence

3505
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:38,460
But to be honest

3506
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,460
Taiwan has never advocated this way

3507
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,460
So we have always advocated

3508
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:43,460
We are already a country

3509
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:48,460
Then ask people to let us join the United Nations

3510
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:49,460
In fact, through the original

3511
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:50,460
I just talked about the United Nations

3512
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:52,460
The right to self-determination mentioned in the Constitution of the United Nations

3513
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:55,460
Then the United Nations

3514
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:58,460
Then the other conventional signatories

3515
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,460
They have no reason to deny

3516
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,460
Taipeng's right to self-determination

3517
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:04,460
Then you exercise

3518
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:06,460
The right to self-determination is the same as the right to self-determination

3519
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:07,460
In fact, the United Nations member states

3520
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:10,460
There is no way to deny the effect of self-determination

3521
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:13,460
So if Taiwan wants to become a country

3522
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:14,460
In fact, it is very important

3523
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:16,460
You use Taiwan as the host

3524
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:18,460
The identity of the pre-colonial

3525
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:19,460
Then combined with the international

3526
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:21,460
Under the consensus of colonization

3527
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,460
Confirm the self-determination of the colony

3528
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,460
According to international convention

3529
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,460
Then ask the United Nations member states to recognize

3530
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:28,460
This one

3531
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:30,460
I personally think this is the most

3532
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,460
The most feasible route

3533
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:35,460
This is definitely more than

3534
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:38,460
Now you claim that Taiwan is already a sovereign independent country

3535
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,460
But you are clearly now

3536
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:42,460
It's a Chinese exile regime

3537
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:45,460
Then you said you want to join the United Nations with this identity

3538
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,460
Will be more effective than that

3539
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:49,460
Because other countries will see that

3540
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:51,460
You are the Chinese regime

3541
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:52,460
I can't admit you

3542
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:54,460
He is in the People's Republic of China regime

3543
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:58,460
Choose one with the Republic of China regime

3544
01:58:58,460 --> 01:59:00,460
OK

3545
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:02,460
So that is to say

3546
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:03,460
In fact, this place just now

3547
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:04,460
In fact, everyone has already talked about it

3548
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:07,460
If you want to enter the United Nations

3549
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:08,460
This is actually

3550
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:09,460
I think there is something

3551
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:10,460
Let me talk a little bit

3552
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:12,460
Entering the United Nations is not the necessary procedure to build a country

3553
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:13,460
Some people say

3554
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:15,460
What does Taiwan have to enter the United Nations

3555
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:18,460
To prove that you are a country

3556
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:22,460
In fact, many countries

3557
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:24,460
I didn't join the United Nations

3558
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:26,460
For example, like Switzerland

3559
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:28,460
I joined the United Nations in 2002

3560
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:31,460
No other country has ever thought that you

3561
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:33,460
Switzerland was not a country before 2002

3562
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:34,460
Right

3563
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:36,460
He is still a country

3564
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:37,460
that

3565
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:38,460
So

3566
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:40,460
You said you want to join the United Nations to build a country

3567
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:41,460
This is not right

3568
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:42,460
This is not right

3569
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:45,460
You have to build a country first

3570
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:47,460
So

3571
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:51,460
You don't have to join the United Nations after building a country

3572
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:54,460
The basis of this sentence is the International Law

3573
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:55,460
Because this is the question of building a country

3574
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:57,460
But it doesn't matter if you don't build a country and you can't join the United Nations

3575
01:59:57,460 --> 01:59:59,460
It has nothing to do with the International Law

3576
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:02,460
It is the rule of the United Nations

3577
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:04,460
No, because the United Nations is

3578
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:05,460
As I said earlier

3579
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:06,460
This is the United Nations

3580
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:08,460
Because the United Nations is an international organization

3581
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:09,460
He himself

3582
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:12,460
The requirement of becoming a member is to be a member

3583
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:14,460
Yes, this is his internal rule

3584
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:16,460
He is not part of the International Law

3585
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:18,460
You have to say he is not part of the International Law

3586
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,460
In fact, it should be said

3587
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:22,460
He set such a rule in accordance with the International Law

3588
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:24,460
He set such a rule in accordance with the International Law

3589
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:25,460
That is to say, because the United Nations

3590
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:26,460
In fact, it is based on the United Nations

3591
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:29,460
An international organization established by the Constitution

3592
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:30,460
OK

3593
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:31,460
Yes

3594
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:33,460
So we can only talk about it now

3595
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,460
We can only talk about it now

3596
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:36,460
That is to say

3597
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:38,460
Members of the international organization

3598
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:40,460
What kind of identity do you need to join

3599
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:41,460
Is the international organization

3600
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:42,460
His

3601
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:44,460
For example, a document like this

3602
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,460
How to write in such a document

3603
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:48,460
How to decide

3604
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:51,460
It is not stipulated that this person must be a country

3605
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:54,460
To join the international organization

3606
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,460
But this rule

3607
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:58,460
Is the rule of this international organization

3608
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:01,460
It was set out in accordance with the International Law

3609
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:02,460
I see

3610
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:03,460
Ok, that one

3611
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:04,460
Because his question just now is

3612
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:07,460
What should be done to uphold international law

3613
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:09,460
He said it could be

3614
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:11,460
But we are basically talking about

3615
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:12,460
How to become

3616
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:13,460
But basically

3617
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:14,460
He turned out to mean the same

3618
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:15,460
How do you become

3619
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:16,460
How does it count

3620
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:18,460
So you answered the first question

3621
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:19,460
Let's talk about the second question directly

3622
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:20,460
Let's talk about the second question directly

3623
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,460
Let's talk about the second question directly

3624
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:22,460
That is

3625
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:25,460
Taipeng broke up with the Republic of China

3626
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:28,460
Do you have to break up with Jinma?

3627
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:30,460
Oh yes

3628
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:32,460
But Jinma

3629
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:33,460
But Jinma, he can

3630
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:36,460
They can also exercise self-determination

3631
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:40,460
What is self-determination

3632
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,460
That is

3633
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:42,460
It should be said like this

3634
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:45,460
That is, Taipeng, you can

3635
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:47,460
Can be self-determined

3636
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:49,460
Become a sovereign independent country

3637
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,460
Right

3638
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:52,460
What about Jinma

3639
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:54,460
Of course it can

3640
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:56,460
Because I just mentioned it here

3641
02:01:56,460 --> 02:02:00,460
What about Jinma

3642
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:02,460
Basically

3643
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:03,460
Taipeng

3644
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:04,460
You follow the international law

3645
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:06,460
Under the context of decolonization

3646
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:08,460
Exercise self-determination

3647
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:10,460
Then establish a sovereign independent country

3648
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,460
This is the way Taipeng wants to go

3649
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:14,460
If you want to be a country

3650
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:15,460
This road is

3651
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:16,460
I think

3652
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:20,460
Personally, I think it is the best way

3653
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:21,460
But part of Jinma

3654
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:24,460
Because his sovereignty belongs to China

3655
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:26,460
So what they need to do is

3656
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:27,460
Independent

3657
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:30,460
To separate from China and come out independently

3658
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,460
Then separate from China and come out independently

3659
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:34,460
Then you have to have a

3660
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:36,460
Chinese regime

3661
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:38,460
To hold such an independent meeting

3662
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:40,460
So Jinma

3663
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:41,460
He said

3664
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:42,460
Want to

3665
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:45,460
If you want to be with Taiwan and Penghu

3666
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,460
That is, Jinma's resident

3667
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:49,460
He followed the regime of the Republic of China

3668
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:52,460
Hold a self-determination meeting there

3669
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:55,460
Then decide whether to be independent from the Republic of China

3670
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:56,460
Then after independence

3671
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:57,460
Then see if he wants to

3672
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:59,460
Become a country here

3673
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:00,460
Or to join

3674
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:02,460
The new country established by Taipeng

3675
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:05,460
This is their choice

3676
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:09,460
But what I have to say is

3677
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:10,460
Jinma people

3678
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:13,460
Do they want to be with Taiwan and Penghu

3679
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:16,460
This is a question mark

3680
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:18,460
This is a big question mark

3681
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:20,460
I think sometimes it is like this

3682
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:22,460
We think they seem to want to be with us

3683
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:24,460
We seem to want us to abandon them

3684
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:25,460
Abandon them or something

3685
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:28,460
But in fact, Jinma people may not think so

3686
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:31,460
They may not think at all

3687
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:33,460
I am Taiwanese

3688
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:34,460
They may

3689
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:36,460
They should basically admit that they are the people of the Republic of China

3690
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:37,460
No problem

3691
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:39,460
The citizens of the Republic of China are OK

3692
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:41,460
But do they think they are Taiwanese?

3693
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:43,460
Do they want to be with Taiwan?

3694
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:45,460
This is sometimes a question mark

3695
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,460
Because you see some news

3696
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:50,460
Jinma people seem

3697
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,460
They seem to think they are Chinese

3698
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:54,460
The ratio is higher

3699
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:56,460
Of course we have opened the way for everyone

3700
02:03:56,460 --> 02:03:58,460
There is a way to go in international law

3701
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:00,460
They hold an independent meeting

3702
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:02,460
See if they want to be independent from China

3703
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:04,460
Then move to another country

3704
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,460
They can do

3705
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:07,460
The other point is that if

3706
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:09,460
Jinma people

3707
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:11,460
They can't get through the independent meeting

3708
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:13,460
Let Jinma become

3709
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,460
Taipeng

3710
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:16,460
Become the same country as Taipeng

3711
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:17,460
His people

3712
02:04:17,460 --> 02:04:19,460
He can also be planned

3713
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:22,460
Become the citizens of this new country

3714
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:24,460
In fact, many Jinma

3715
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,460
Jinma people

3716
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:27,460
They are actually living on the island of Taiwan now

3717
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,460
May be there to get married and have children

3718
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:31,460
Then buy a house or something

3719
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:32,460
So for them

3720
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:34,460
Maybe most of the time they are in Taiwan

3721
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,460
Maybe they think

3722
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:38,460
Maybe it will become the citizens of Taipeng

3723
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,460
No problem

3724
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:42,460
If they don't want to

3725
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:44,460
They can also be the people of the Republic of China

3726
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:46,460
Is a foreigner

3727
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:48,460
Continue to stay

3728
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:50,460
In fact, the subsequent disposal

3729
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:52,460
There are legal means

3730
02:04:52,460 --> 02:04:54,460
It can be solved

3731
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:55,460
Just

3732
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:57,460
It's just that in international law

3733
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,460
If we want to

3734
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:00,460
If you want to deal with this issue

3735
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:01,460
You have to separate

3736
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:03,460
Because there is no way to solve the problem together

3737
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:05,460
If you put it together

3738
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,460
You just mix it up

3739
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:08,460
The unsettled

3740
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,460
With those who belong to the territory of China

3741
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:12,460
There is no way to do it together

3742
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:14,460
Because when it comes to processing

3743
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:16,460
The rules are different

3744
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:18,460
So you have to deal with it

3745
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:19,460
Must be divided

3746
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:21,460
But will it be together in the end?

3747
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:23,460
That depends on

3748
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:24,460
I would think

3749
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:26,460
It depends on the wishes of the Kinmen people

3750
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:29,460
I don't know if they want to be with Taiwan

3751
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,460
OK

3752
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:32,460
So for the second question

3753
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:34,460
Basically the answer is the first

3754
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:35,460
Yes

3755
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:37,460
Have to break up with Kinmen

3756
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:38,460
The second is

3757
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:39,460
But Kinmen can be based on

3758
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:41,460
Is the context of decolonization

3759
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:43,460
Make their own self-awareness

3760
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:45,460
Kinmen is not the context of decolonization

3761
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:47,460
Because Kinmen has not been colonized

3762
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:48,460
OK

3763
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:49,460
Kinmen they

3764
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:50,460
Because they are independent

3765
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:52,460
They are directly separated and independent

3766
02:05:52,460 --> 02:05:54,460
Taiwan and Penghu

3767
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:56,460
Taiwan and Penghu are decolonized

3768
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,460
Kinmen is separated and independent

3769
02:05:58,460 --> 02:06:00,460
That is to say, separated and independent from China

3770
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:02,460
Just like Scotland

3771
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:04,460
Separated from the United Kingdom

3772
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:06,460
Quebec is separated from Canada

3773
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:07,460
OK

3774
02:06:07,460 --> 02:06:09,460
Kinmen independence is such a form

3775
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,460
Different from Taiwan

3776
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:12,460
That

3777
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:15,460
Liu said thank you for the detailed explanation of the speaker

3778
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:16,460
Then I think

3779
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:17,460
Come here today

3780
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:18,460
Also cover you

3781
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:19,460
Last

3782
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:20,460
Sorry

3783
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:21,460
The part that was cut off by me

3784
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,460
Most of the cut

3785
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:24,460
I just finished talking

3786
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:25,460
OK

3787
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:26,460
Ok

3788
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:28,460
We are here again

3789
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:29,460
Applause

3790
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:31,460
Thank you for the speech brought to us by Saint

3791
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:33,460
It's already two o'clock in the middle of the night over there

3792
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:35,460
Thank you very much

3793
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,460
Thank you

3794
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:37,460
That

3795
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:38,460
Everyone is me

3796
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,460
I want to stop recording first

3797
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:41,460
But you are welcome to continue discussing

3798
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:42,460
OK
