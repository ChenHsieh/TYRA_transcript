0	7000	Hello, everyone. Good evening. Welcome to today's Tower Talk.
7000	12000	Today, we are very honored to have our speaker, Lucas Peng,
12000	17000	to talk to us about this. Basically, he just graduated from his doctorate thesis.
17000	21000	Clocked atom delivery to a photonic crystal waveguide.
21000	25000	And then there's the simulation part, and then there's the experimental part.
25000	31000	And then he used to be in the Kimball Group at the California Institute of Technology, doing quantum optics.
31000	36000	So let me introduce the background of Lucas Peng.
36000	45000	Wait a minute, I'll turn it off.
45000	65000	Lucas Peng's doctoral research is mainly focused on the quantum simulation platform by trapping atoms close to the surface of photonic crystal waveguide.
65000	71000	And then after he got his doctorate, he went to a company in North Carolina called AO Sensing,
71000	75000	which is currently developing quantum sensing technology.
75000	78000	Lucas Peng is actually a senior at the California Institute of Technology.
78000	81000	He was originally a biophysicist at the University of Taiwan.
81000	85000	And then after graduation, he went to Caltech and got his doctorate.
85000	88000	And now he's in North Carolina.
88000	90000	He's going to talk to us about the topic I just talked about.
91000	94000	If you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone.
94000	96000	Otherwise, our speakers won't be able to hear you.
96000	100000	So let's applaud and welcome Lucas Peng to give us today's speech.
100000	104000	Thank you.
104000	106000	Okay, you can start.
106000	110000	Thank you, Mr. Zhang, for giving me the opportunity to share my research.
110000	115000	If you have any questions during my presentation, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.
116000	120000	The topic I'm going to talk about today is my Ph.D. research.
120000	127000	It's mainly about how to put color atoms near the photonic crystal waveguide.
127000	134000	The main purpose is that if you can successfully capture the atoms near the photonic crystal waveguide,
134000	137000	you can use it as a quantum simulation platform.
138000	144000	First, I'm going to talk about our experimental system.
144000	149000	This is the transparent photonic crystal waveguide.
149000	155000	The atoms are trapped in the gap between the two waveguides.
155000	159000	So let me first explain why this system is different from other systems,
159000	163000	such as nanofiber or cavity QED.
163000	166000	What's the difference? What's the advantage?
166000	170000	And of course, what challenges will it bring?
170000	176000	Next, I'm going to introduce a simulation program I developed.
176000	183000	It simulates how atoms move near the photonic crystal waveguide.
183000	189000	And it calculates a 2D spectrum using these simulations.
189000	194000	After getting this spectrum, we can understand the behavior of atoms near the waveguide.
194000	200000	Finally, it will show some experiment results and compare them with the simulation results.
200000	205000	Then we can see what conclusions we can get from it.
205000	213000	First of all, the purpose of this research is to achieve a very strong interaction between light and atoms.
213000	215000	Why is this important?
215000	222000	In the study of quantum technology, such as quantum mechanics or quantum information,
222000	226000	we usually use light to transmit quantum information.
226000	232000	When the quantum information is transmitted, we hope it will be transferred to another system.
232000	235000	Because these systems have a longer lifetime,
235000	240000	the quantum information can be kept longer to do more processing.
240000	249000	In the field of ML, one of the research directions is to transfer quantum information from light to atoms.
249000	253000	To do this, we need a very strong interaction between light and atoms.
253000	259000	Of course, the simplest way is to focus light on a very small area,
259000	261000	which is about a wavelength.
261000	266000	Then put an atom in the focal length to interact with light and atoms.
266000	275000	The limitation of this method is that the area of light is ultimately limited by the wavelength.
275000	281000	In this way, the probability of interaction between light and atoms is very low.
281000	284000	How to make this probability higher?
284000	288000	One way is to put the atom in a cavity.
288000	292000	You can imagine that the light is reflected in the cavity.
292000	296000	Every time the light passes through the atom, it will have one more chance to interact with the atom.
296000	301000	In this way, the probability of interaction between light and atoms can be greatly increased.
301000	311000	In addition to using a cavity, you can also use a resonator structure like this microtoray.
311000	313000	In fact, it is a bit like a cavity.
313000	315000	The light will keep circling in this circle.
315000	319000	Every time the light passes through the atom, it will have one more chance to interact with the atom.
320000	323000	Another way is to increase the number of atoms.
323000	325000	For example, the Rieper atom.
325000	328000	As long as one of the atoms interacts with the light,
328000	335000	it will move to a high quantum number state.
335000	339000	In this way, it can block other atoms and continue to interact with the light.
339000	346000	So it seems that one atom can be equivalent to a huge atom.
347000	354000	What I just said is that the light is reflected back and forth in the cavity.
354000	361000	Another way is to imagine that the cavity changes the density of light.
361000	364000	So the atoms can have more states to interact with.
364000	368000	This is another way to look at it.
369000	375000	In addition to the cavity QED, there is another system called waveguide QED.
375000	383000	The waveguide QED is a model that can be seen as a very thin fiber and an atom.
383000	386000	When the light moves in this fiber,
386000	390000	you can imagine that it has an input capacitor,
390000	398000	a transmittance and a reflection capacitor.
398000	408000	You can calculate the reflection formula of this system.
408000	410000	The most important number in it is gamma1d.
410000	420000	Gamma1d is the probability that the light will move to the fiber after the atom decays.
420000	424000	Because we want a very strong interaction between light and atoms,
424000	426000	the higher the probability, the better.
426000	434000	Gamma' is the probability that the light decays to other unnecessary states in space.
435000	443000	The research of strong atom-photon coupling is to make gamma1d higher and better.
443000	445000	How to make it higher?
445000	448000	There are several ways to do it.
448000	452000	One way is to reduce the molar area.
452000	457000	The smaller the area, the higher the probability of interaction between light and atoms.
457000	462000	Another way is to reduce the proof velocity.
462000	466000	Proof velocity means that the slower the light moves in the fiber,
466000	469000	the more chance it has to interact with the atoms.
474000	478000	An important figure of merit is gamma1d to gamma'.
478000	482000	The light decays to the state you want,
482000	484000	which is the state in the fiber.
484000	489000	The light decays to the state you want, which is the state in the fiber.
493000	497000	The system we made in the lab is a finite crystal waveguide.
497000	500000	What is the difference between a finite crystal waveguide and a normal light fiber?
500000	509000	The point is that the distance from the light fiber to the atom is limited by the wavelength.
509000	516000	The ratio of gamma1d to gamma' is about 4% in the current experiment.
516000	523000	90% of the light does not interact with the atom, but only passes through the atom.
523000	529000	In theory, if the light can be captured very close to the finite crystal waveguide,
529000	533000	gamma1d over gamma' can be increased to about 20.
533000	541000	In this way, only 0.2% of the light will interact with the atom.
543000	548000	Why is gamma1d over gamma' so high?
548000	555000	The reason is that the finite crystal waveguide allows you to control the group velocity.
555000	559000	For example, if the light is very close to the finite crystal band edge,
559000	561000	the group velocity becomes very low.
561000	568000	For example, in our system, the group velocity can only be 1 tenth of the light.
568000	574000	Another reason is that the finite crystal waveguide can be made into a variety of shapes.
574000	579000	You can design this shape to limit the light in a very small range.
579000	585000	For example, the system we use allows the light to be concentrated in the middle gap.
586000	591000	This allows the light to be limited to a smaller area than the wavelength.
591000	594000	This can greatly improve the interaction between light and atoms.
597000	602000	In this system, light is an atom, and it can reflect almost all light.
602000	605000	You can imagine it as a quantum mirror.
606000	613000	Waveguide QED, in addition to the finite crystal waveguide called Alligator,
613000	615000	also has a variety of applications.
615000	619000	For example, you can extend the heat of the light,
619000	623000	and it will become a very thin light, the nano fiber.
623000	627000	You can also put some trees in it.
627000	631000	It will form some traps in the environment.
631000	636000	This will capture the atoms around the light.
636000	641000	Another system, like Huffle's Looking Group,
641000	644000	is also a finite crystal waveguide.
644000	648000	They use an optical tweezer to hold the atom,
648000	652000	and drag it near the finite crystal waveguide.
652000	657000	This allows it to interact with the guided mode in the finite crystal waveguide.
658000	662000	At Purdue University, they also have a system
662000	667000	that uses an optical tweezer to capture the atoms
667000	673000	near the finite crystal waveguide.
677000	681000	Another special feature of the finite crystal waveguide is...
681000	683000	One more question.
683000	685000	This is a general question.
685000	688000	What kind of material do you use for structures like this?
688000	695000	It depends on what kind of waveguide you want to transmit the light.
695000	699000	You want it to be as transparent as possible.
699000	705000	For example, the CZM waveguide we use is 890nm.
705000	708000	We use Zirconitride.
714000	716000	Got it. Thank you.
716000	722000	So you can choose the material you want based on the wavelength you want.
722000	725000	For example, we often use Telecom Waveband.
725000	729000	You can also use materials like Silica.
732000	734000	A special feature of the waveguide
734000	736000	is that you can design your waveguide
736000	742000	to have different wavelengths in different frequencies.
742000	745000	For example, this is a bandstructure graph.
745000	748000	The horizontal axis is the wave number,
748000	751000	and the vertical axis is the frequency.
751000	753000	You can see that at this frequency...
753000	756000	For example, at a certain frequency, the light can't fall inside.
756000	759000	This is a concept called bandgap.
759000	763000	At the edge of the bandgap,
763000	767000	you can see that the dΩdk is equal to 0.
767000	770000	This means that the group velocity is very small.
770000	774000	So in this case, the density of states is very high.
774000	778000	So if the frequency of the original wave is around here,
778000	782000	you can imagine that it can interact with many states.
782000	785000	This can greatly increase the probability of decaying to the state.
785000	790000	So we usually design the FWG to have a bandgap
790000	792000	that is very close to the original wavelength.
793000	799000	So you can imagine that the dΩdk can be outside the bandgap,
799000	801000	or inside the bandgap.
801000	804000	The first case is that when the dΩdk is outside the bandgap,
804000	808000	you can see that this frequency can be transmitted in the waveguide.
808000	812000	For example, when the original wave goes from GF to GF,
812000	813000	it emits a light.
813000	817000	This light is at the frequency that can be transmitted,
817000	819000	so it will move on the waveguide.
819000	824000	So you can imagine that the interaction between the atoms on the waveguide is as strong.
824000	826000	This is a region.
826000	831000	Another region is that if you put the frequency of the atom's wavelength into the bandgap,
831000	835000	because the light of this frequency cannot be transmitted inside the waveguide,
835000	841000	it will form an exponential decay light cloud near the atom.
841000	843000	So it's more interesting at this time.
843000	847000	The farther the atoms are, the lower their interaction.
847000	850000	The closer the atoms are, the longer the interaction.
850000	855000	So you can imagine that this can have some local interaction.
855000	860000	Next, I will explain how to control the two atoms in this region
860000	862000	to produce a convenient interaction.
862000	865000	So in theory, as long as you have a one-dimensional system,
865000	870000	you can let the atoms produce a Hamiltonian that can be engineered conveniently.
870000	875000	Let's start with a simple example outside the waveguide.
878000	884000	This is an experiment we did in our lab in 2015.
884000	893000	The way to do this experiment is to use a laser beam to shine on the waveguide.
893000	896000	It will form such an interference pattern.
896000	902000	You can see that the interference pattern has some intensity maxima here and here.
902000	904000	We call it Z1, Z2.
904000	910000	If the laser frequency is slightly lower than the intensity of the atom,
910000	914000	it will attract the atoms to the intensity maxima.
914000	921000	By this way, we will catch some atoms near the front crystal waveguide.
921000	927000	This place is above the waveguide, so it's not in the middle of the waveguide.
927000	930000	So in this place, γ1d over γ' is about 2.
930000	941000	This means that when it decays, the probability of it decaying to the waveguide is 2 times higher than the probability of it decaying to the vacuum.
941000	951000	What's interesting about this is that if the atoms are periodically caught on the front crystal waveguide,
951000	961000	if the interference between them is the wavelength of the vacuum,
961000	970000	an atom can interact with the entire collective state of the atom.
970000	975000	In this way, the interaction will enhance the number of atoms.
975000	981000	For example, if you have nA atoms, the interaction between them will increase nA times.
981000	985000	But the number of atoms decays to free space is the same.
985000	990000	So the more atoms you have, the more likely it is to decay to the waveguide.
990000	993000	This is a phenomenon similar to superradiance.
993000	1002000	In this experiment, the number of atoms is used to control how long you have been caught.
1002000	1006000	The longer you have been caught, the more likely the atom will escape your trap.
1006000	1012000	So here you can see that when the atom is caught, the decay speed is very fast.
1012000	1015000	When you let it go for a long time, the decay speed drops.
1015000	1025000	We can see that when the number of atoms increases, the interaction between it and the state of the waveguide increases.
1025000	1034000	You can do the same experiment in the same way.
1034000	1040000	But this time we can adjust the bandage of the waveguide to the outside of the atom.
1040000	1043000	Although the wavelength frequency of the atom is inside the bandgap.
1043000	1048000	At this time, you can see that there are two traces here.
1048000	1059000	The green trace describes the intensity of the photon decay to the waveguide.
1059000	1064000	The blue trace measures how long the interaction between the atoms is.
1064000	1071000	The intensity of this interaction can be determined by the symmetry of the measured spectrum.
1071000	1074000	If the interaction is stronger, the spectrum will not be symmetrical.
1074000	1078000	So you can measure how strong the interaction between the atoms is.
1078000	1083000	You can see that when the wavelength frequency of the atom enters the bandgap,
1083000	1089000	The photon does not decay to the waveguide.
1089000	1097000	But the interaction between the atoms is still greater than the probability of the photon decaying to the waveguide.
1097000	1112000	This means that in the bandgap region, the photon is still a potential decay cloud.
1112000	1125000	Next, if you can put the atoms in the waveguide and form a string,
1125000	1133000	You can add a magnetic field to make each atom's Zeeman state different.
1133000	1140000	For example, you can use an extra laser beam to add a sideband.
1140000	1147000	The sideband can match the difference in the frequency of the Zeeman state between the atoms.
1147000	1151000	Then you can engineer the interaction between two random atoms.
1151000	1156000	For example, the system here has a one-dimensional atom array.
1156000	1158000	There are interactions between the two arrays.
1158000	1162000	The interaction between the rightmost and the leftmost sideband can be simulated.
1162000	1168000	It is a circular system.
1176000	1179000	Excuse me, can I go back to the page?
1179000	1181000	I don't quite understand.
1181000	1182000	Wait a minute, I don't quite understand.
1182000	1184000	You said two interactions.
1184000	1186000	Why does it become a circle?
1186000	1189000	It doesn't overlap the last two interactions.
1189000	1195000	For example, when you want to make two atoms interact,
1195000	1197000	You have to let...
1197000	1198000	Take a look at this state first.
1198000	1201000	There are three states in this atom.
1201000	1204000	There are two ground states and one excited state.
1204000	1207000	No, I know what's up there.
1207000	1209000	Oh, no, it's okay, I saw it.
1209000	1210000	Because my idea is,
1210000	1212000	Don't you all interact with the neighbors?
1212000	1215000	How did it become a periodic boundary condition?
1215000	1216000	That's how it becomes a circle.
1216000	1217000	You're right.
1217000	1219000	The beginning and the end also interact.
1219000	1223000	Yes, but it doesn't necessarily only interact with the neighbors.
1223000	1224000	Does it interact?
1224000	1227000	It depends on the frequency of your guiding mode.
1227000	1233000	Does it resonate with the frequency of your other state?
1233000	1237000	You can imagine that you can add a magnetic field.
1237000	1239000	It's a gradient magnetic field.
1239000	1243000	Let every atom's Zeeman state have a slightly different frequency.
1246000	1248000	So basically, you can just pick it up.
1248000	1249000	You don't have to...
1249000	1254000	You can use an extra laser frequency to pick up the two atoms.
1254000	1257000	Oh, okay, okay, I see.
1257000	1259000	Hello, can I ask a question?
1259000	1264000	Is this similar to gradient echo memory?
1264000	1271000	It's a bit like spin echo.
1271000	1277000	Gn, gradient echo memory, is a magnetic field that slowly increases.
1277000	1283000	Then every connection will have a slightly different splitting.
1283000	1286000	Yes, it's a bit like this.
1286000	1288000	Is there a difference between the two?
1288000	1293000	Who has the advantage?
1293000	1296000	I should say...
1296000	1301000	I just said that using a strong magnetic field to create a difference.
1301000	1303000	But you don't have to use a magnetic field.
1303000	1309000	You can use the AC source shape to let each state have a different frequency.
1309000	1313000	In this case, you don't necessarily need a gradient.
1313000	1324000	You can have a laser for each atom to generate different shapes.
1325000	1327000	Okay, thank you.
1332000	1338000	Next, I will introduce the Delegator Functional Crystal Waveguide we use.
1338000	1346000	This is what the whole system looks like.
1346000	1353000	First of all, the whole system is hanging on the window in the middle of the chip.
1353000	1358000	The way we interact with the waveguide is mainly through the light.
1358000	1361000	The light is stuck to the chip.
1361000	1365000	Then it can be coupled with the waveguide.
1365000	1369000	You can see that there are many other structures on the waveguide.
1369000	1372000	For example, there is a coupler here.
1372000	1375000	Then there are some mechanical structures here.
1375000	1383000	The purpose of the coupler is to pull the device so that the two beams in the middle do not stick together.
1383000	1396000	So this angle is optimized so that the center of the waveguide can maintain the gap.
1396000	1403000	In addition, these structures are responsible for the heat generated by the laser.
1405000	1410000	You will find that even if you only input a few microwave lasers,
1410000	1417000	Because the whole structure is very small, it will become very hot.
1417000	1424000	This is a device, SEM.
1424000	1428000	But you don't do active cooling, do you?
1428000	1432000	You just do it in the light.
1432000	1436000	In fact, we still have to heat it up.
1436000	1439000	Because we can't cool it down.
1439000	1443000	So sometimes you adjust the frequency to heat it up.
1443000	1450000	After heating it up, you can change its bandage.
1450000	1456000	So you don't just do it, but you don't want active cooling.
1456000	1463000	It's not that you can't do it, but we don't do active cooling.
1463000	1466000	And there's a bad thing about being too cold.
1466000	1469000	If you're cold, your laser will stick to it.
1469000	1474000	So sometimes you want it to get hotter and hotter.
1474000	1476000	Excuse me.
1476000	1477000	Thank you.
1477000	1482000	You said your structure is about a few hundred nanometers.
1482000	1485000	Then you said you need to use fiber.
1485000	1487000	Is it because this structure is very small?
1487000	1491000	You need to use evanescent wave to go in.
1491000	1494000	With the effect of atoms.
1494000	1495000	Yes.
1495000	1499000	Because in the end you want to send the light to the waveguide.
1499000	1504000	So the way we use it is to put...
1504000	1505000	You can see it on this side.
1505000	1510000	We stick the fiber to the chip.
1510000	1512000	Align it with the waveguide.
1512000	1514000	I was surprised at first.
1514000	1516000	You think the fiber is big.
1516000	1519000	The waveguide is only a few hundred nanometers.
1519000	1521000	You think its mode doesn't match.
1521000	1523000	But if you calculate the waveguide's mode.
1523000	1527000	You find that the fiber's mode matches 90%.
1528000	1537000	In fact, about 50% of the light can be sent to the waveguide.
1537000	1545000	Is the light coming from the evanescent wave?
1545000	1550000	Or is it a normal wave transmitted?
1550000	1553000	Because it's single-mode fiber.
1553000	1560000	It's like a mode built in fiber.
1560000	1564000	It just came out and it's directly on the waveguide's mode.
1564000	1568000	So as long as its mode is matched, it can continue to pass through the waveguide.
1568000	1571000	It's not an evanescent wave.
1571000	1573000	But it's not a Gaussian beam.
1573000	1577000	It's a single-mode fiber in the waveguide.
1578000	1585000	The mode depends on the gradient of the evanescent wave.
1591000	1593000	This is an experiment photo.
1593000	1596000	We stick the light on the chip.
1596000	1601000	Mount it on a viewport.
1601000	1606000	Then install the viewport into the vacuum chamber.
1608000	1615000	Let me briefly explain the CZM's energy level.
1615000	1624000	The CZM's fine structure uses 6S and 6P states.
1624000	1626000	6S is the ground state.
1626000	1628000	6P is the fine structure.
1628000	1632000	Because of the spin-orbit coupling, there are two different connections.
1632000	1635000	If you consider the hyperfine structure,
1635000	1640000	it's because of the nuclear spin and the electron spin.
1640000	1645000	The ground state is subdivided into Fn3 and Fn4.
1645000	1653000	The 6P state can also be divided into two connections.
1653000	1656000	The upper one is divided into four connections.
1657000	1665000	The lower frequency is called D1.
1665000	1668000	The higher frequency is called D2.
1672000	1677000	The design of the finite crystal waveguide allows D1 to correspond to a band edge.
1677000	1679000	D2 corresponds to another band edge.
1679000	1682000	You can imagine a simple idea.
1683000	1690000	You use a band edge frequency, D1, to capture the atom.
1690000	1694000	You use another frequency, D2, to trap the atom.
1694000	1700000	For example, if you put D2's laser into the waveguide,
1700000	1702000	and make it slightly blue detuned,
1702000	1707000	the atom will be pushed to the intensity minima.
1707000	1711000	The atom will be trapped to the thickest point.
1711000	1715000	You can use another band edge frequency, D1, to probe the atom.
1715000	1717000	Because D1 is another band edge,
1717000	1720000	the intensity will be stronger at the thickest point.
1720000	1724000	In this case, you can use one frequency to capture,
1724000	1727000	and another frequency to detect the atom.
1727000	1732000	Of course, this is a simplified model.
1732000	1737000	There will be more details in the introduction.
1742000	1748000	The main purpose of our experiment is to capture the atom in the finite crystal gap.
1748000	1751000	And we hope that each size can capture an atom.
1751000	1754000	If you can do this,
1754000	1758000	you can think about promoting it to more complex systems,
1758000	1761000	such as binary finite crystal.
1762000	1770000	Here is a brief description of the basic atom cooling and capturing techniques used in the experiment.
1770000	1775000	The methods used are MOP,
1775000	1778000	Dipole Trap,
1778000	1780000	Optical Lattice,
1780000	1784000	and a cooling technique called Degenerate Raman Side-In Cooling.
1784000	1790000	MOP is a method of surrounding the atom group.
1790000	1792000	There are six lasers in total.
1792000	1797000	You can imagine that it is like a Doppler cooling in every direction.
1797000	1803000	The atom going down will be absorbed by the light
1803000	1805000	and released from the inside,
1805000	1807000	so it will get a momentum kick,
1807000	1810000	and it will be cooled.
1810000	1816000	The purpose of adding this magnetic field is to introduce a space-dependent shift
1816000	1818000	to generate confinement.
1818000	1821000	If you have confinement and cooling,
1821000	1823000	you can make a MOP.
1827000	1831000	Another concept is Optical Dipole Trap.
1831000	1833000	As I just explained,
1833000	1838000	if the frequency of the laser is slightly lower than the frequency of the atomic moon,
1838000	1841000	it will produce a shift to your connection.
1841000	1843000	In this case,
1843000	1846000	the ground state will shift down,
1846000	1848000	and the excited state will shift up.
1848000	1850000	You can see that in the ground state atom,
1850000	1854000	it will produce a space-dependent potential.
1854000	1857000	At this time, the frequency of the atomic moon can also change.
1857000	1864000	I will talk about how to help us understand where the atom is in space.
1864000	1870000	For example, if the frequency of the laser is slightly lower than the frequency of the atomic moon,
1870000	1878000	the atom will be sucked into the Intensity Maxima.
1878000	1880000	If the light is Blue Detuned,
1880000	1884000	the atom will be blown away by the Intensity Maxima.
1884000	1887000	So if there is Intensity Minima in your potential,
1887000	1889000	the atom will be gathered in that place.
1891000	1893000	There are different configurations.
1893000	1895000	The simplest is Gaussian Beam.
1895000	1897000	It can produce a trap.
1897000	1901000	In the lab, we use two lasers to form a standing wave.
1901000	1905000	At this time, the atom can be captured in the standing wave.
1905000	1907000	It looks like a lattice.
1907000	1909000	This is called Optical Lattice.
1911000	1914000	After the atom is caught in the Optical Lattice,
1914000	1915000	we still need to cool it.
1915000	1919000	The cooling method we use here is called Degenerate Raman Sibon Cooling.
1919000	1921000	This is a very ingenious way.
1921000	1924000	The way is that you can add a magnetic field
1924000	1929000	to produce a little change in the connection between atoms in different MF states.
1929000	1933000	If the difference in energy between each MF state
1933000	1939000	is just equal to the energy of the H-bar omega
1939000	1942000	that vibrates in your Optical Lattice,
1942000	1948000	you can see that the vibrating state of under 1
1948000	1952000	is the same energy as the under 0 state of the next MF state.
1952000	1955000	At this time, you can use the Raman Transition method
1955000	1960000	to transfer the atom from n equals 1 to the under 0 state
1960000	1962000	and then pump it back.
1962000	1964000	After this cycle,
1964000	1967000	the atom can reduce the vibration frame.
1967000	1969000	By repeating this process,
1969000	1971000	in theory, you can cool the atom
1971000	1975000	to the vibration state in your trap.
1975000	1977000	By doing this,
1977000	1981000	we can cool the atom in the Optical Lattice.
1985000	1988000	Once the atom is trapped in the Optical Lattice,
1988000	1992000	the way we experiment here is to move the Optical Lattice.
1992000	1995000	As long as you change one of the laser frequencies,
1995000	1998000	the entire interference pattern will start to move.
1998000	2003000	We can use this method to let the atom pass through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2004000	2006000	The purpose is that
2006000	2012000	each piece of the Optical Lattice's MF
2012000	2013000	is called a pancake.
2013000	2017000	For example, there are 500 atoms in it.
2017000	2019000	Of these 500 atoms,
2019000	2022000	only a small part will interact with the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2022000	2025000	But in the experiment cycle,
2025000	2030000	there are 2000 pancakes passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2030000	2032000	Through this method,
2032000	2036000	we can try to let more atoms interact with the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2040000	2046000	This is a simple picture of our experiment.
2046000	2052000	First, we make a MOD of the atom in the Source Chamber.
2052000	2057000	Then we use a laser to kick it into another MOD in the main chamber.
2057000	2061000	Then we cool the atom in the MOD
2061000	2063000	and trap it in the Optical Lattice.
2063000	2067000	The Optical Lattice is a beam of two lasers.
2067000	2071000	Once the atom is caught in the Optical Lattice,
2071000	2073000	we change the frequency of one of the lasers
2073000	2077000	and move the atom near the device.
2077000	2080000	When the atom is near the device,
2080000	2083000	we can put a few beams into the waveguide.
2083000	2087000	One of the beams is a Probe Laser.
2087000	2092000	This laser adjusts the frequency of D1 of the DZM.
2092000	2098000	If the atom is near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy,
2098000	2100000	it will absorb the light of the Probe.
2100000	2107000	We can use the amount of Probe through the waveguide
2107000	2112000	to measure how many atoms interact with the waveguide.
2112000	2119000	We can also put various trapped potentials into the waveguide.
2119000	2122000	Another important component is that
2122000	2125000	when the Optical Lattice passes through the waveguide,
2125000	2128000	some light will be emitted into the waveguide.
2128000	2133000	We can also detect the light emitted by the Optical Lattice.
2133000	2138000	Through this light, we can know which part of the Optical Lattice is passing through the waveguide.
2138000	2141000	Is it passing through the waveguide at the peak?
2141000	2144000	Or is it passing through the waveguide at the valley?
2144000	2147000	Through this, we can have more data to understand
2147000	2151000	how the atom moves near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2156000	2158000	This is an experimental result.
2158000	2163000	We can see that the atom passes through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy at T20.
2163000	2165000	The horizontal axis is the time,
2165000	2168000	and the vertical axis is the frequency of the Probe Beam.
2168000	2175000	We can turn the Probe Beam from negative 50 MHz to positive 50 MHz detuning.
2175000	2178000	The atom passes through the waveguide at T20.
2182000	2185000	This is the data from one of the photodials.
2185000	2190000	The photodial specifically detects the light emitted by the Optical Lattice.
2190000	2196000	When the atom passes through, it generates a periodic signal.
2196000	2203000	The frequency of this signal depends on how fast the Optical Lattice passes through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2203000	2211000	For example, we are using a frequency of about 1.2 MHz to move the Optical Lattice.
2211000	2215000	The signal is 1.2 MHz.
2216000	2226000	Through this signal, we can know what time the atom is passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2226000	2230000	Note that the time scale here is microsecond.
2230000	2234000	The time scale on the right is millisecond.
2234000	2242000	So there are thousands of Optical Lattice pancakes passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy in these two Blobs.
2246000	2257000	Do you know the number of atoms in each Blob?
2257000	2263000	We can know how many atoms are near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2263000	2272000	At any time, there may be one or two atoms passing through the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2272000	2282000	We estimate that each pancake will have one atom passing through the gap of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2282000	2287000	This is where we really want to catch the atoms.
2287000	2293000	The reason why we use Optical Lattice is to get a cycle.
2293000	2298000	For example, each pancake can catch one atom in the gap.
2298000	2303000	If 100 pancakes pass through the gap, we can catch 100 atoms.
2303000	2307000	The purpose of this experiment is to find a trapping cycle.
2307000	2313000	So that each Optical Lattice cycle can catch one atom.
2313000	2317000	Of course, we haven't reached this goal yet.
2317000	2323000	But my PhD research is moving in this direction.
2324000	2331000	We just saw that the setup of the experiment can produce such an experiment result.
2331000	2335000	How do we interpret this experiment result?
2335000	2345000	Through simulation, we can help us understand how these atomic trajectories correspond to the experimental results we get.
2346000	2352000	This simulation is a Monte Carlo simulation.
2352000	2356000	The atoms are scattered in the Optical Lattice.
2356000	2360000	They are then formalized and moved to the vicinity of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2360000	2365000	According to the Optical Dipole Potential, each atom moves.
2365000	2371000	Finally, we collect these trajectories and calculate the spectrum we should get.
2372000	2376000	The concept of simulation is very complicated.
2376000	2380000	But there are some challenges in practice.
2380000	2385000	Because it is a periodic potential,
2385000	2392000	you need to measure a large area for the atoms to formalize in this potential.
2392000	2398000	For example, our simulation domain is a few tens of microns.
2398000	2401000	But the Phonar Crystal is a very small device.
2401000	2406000	Its size is a few hundred nanometers to a micron.
2406000	2411000	So the whole experiment is very memory-intensive.
2411000	2415000	So most of the time, it is optimized to use as little data as possible.
2415000	2424000	The concept of simulation is to let the atoms simulate how they move from a faraway place to the vicinity of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2425000	2436000	Then simulate various Optical Dipole Force and Probing Beam Profile to calculate the spectrum you will get.
2436000	2440000	You can also do 3D simulation.
2440000	2444000	For example, this is a simulation result.
2444000	2447000	You can see the lines here are the atomic trajectories.
2447000	2454000	The atomic trajectories can be subdivided into different types of trajectories.
2454000	2459000	For example, these green trajectories are the gaps in the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2459000	2461000	These are the atoms we are most interested in.
2461000	2465000	The other blue trajectories are the ones that go around the outside of the device.
2465000	2468000	The red ones are the ones that hit the surface of the device.
2469000	2477000	Next, we're going to use these trajectories to calculate a spectrum.
2477000	2480000	How do you calculate the spectrum?
2480000	2487000	You can distribute the atomic trajectories to the top of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2487000	2489000	For example, there are a few atoms here.
2489000	2494000	You can use a matrix to represent each segment of the Phonar Crystal Lake guy.
2494000	2498000	This matrix is called the transfer matrix.
2498000	2500000	The Phonar Crystal Lake guy has its own transfer matrix.
2500000	2502000	Each atom has its own transfer matrix.
2502000	2508000	The transfer matrix of the atoms depends on the location of the atoms.
2508000	2519000	We can see that the Gamma 1D is determined by the strength of the probe at that location.
2519000	2525000	The distance between the atoms near the Phonar Crystal Lake guy determines the strength of the Gamma 1D.
2525000	2528000	The transfer matrix of each atom is different.
2528000	2533000	If we multiply all these matrices, we get the total transfer matrix.
2533000	2539000	From there, we can get the transmission and reflection of the entire system.
2542000	2546000	Next, let's see what the simulation results will be.
2546000	2553000	I just explained how to get the atomic trajectories through simulation.
2553000	2561000	Next, I will explain how to connect the results of our experiment through simulation.
2566000	2569000	Here is a tool we use.
2569000	2571000	We call it the Clock Spectrum.
2571000	2572000	Why is it called Clock?
2572000	2575000	Because our apical lattice sends the atoms near the device.
2575000	2580000	The atoms are cyclically sent near the Phonar Crystal.
2580000	2586000	For example, if your chirping frequency is 1MHz, each micron will have an atom passing through.
2586000	2590000	Theoretically, you can get a cyclic signal.
2590000	2596000	The cyclic signal depends on the frequency of the atoms coming to your device.
2597000	2603000	For example, if we look at the light coming out of the probe and make it into a histogram,
2603000	2611000	we can see that the frequency of the apical lattice is a cyclic signal.
2611000	2618000	We can also detect the apical lattice signal through another photodiode.
2618000	2628000	This gives us a clock so that we can know which part of the apical lattice is passing through our waveguide.
2628000	2641000	If you fold the signals of each microsecond into an apical lattice period, you can get a histogram.
2642000	2660000	The histogram tells you how many atoms are interacting with the device at different times in the apical lattice frequency.
2660000	2667000	If you do this experiment for each detuning, you can get a two-dimensional spectrum.
2667000	2678000	In this two-dimensional picture, the horizontal axis is the time, and the vertical axis is the probe detuning.
2678000	2685000	This two-dimensional spectrum can convey some information about the atoms moving near the Phonar Crystal waveguide.
2685000	2692000	The next step is to find out how to match the atomic trajectory to the two-dimensional spectrum.
2693000	2697000	There are different modes for this experiment.
2697000	2704000	As mentioned earlier, we let the bandage correspond to the transition of C-joint D1 and D2.
2704000	2708000	Another mode is polarization.
2708000	2715000	As mentioned earlier, the bandage corresponds to when the polarization is parallel to the waveguide.
2715000	2719000	If it is perpendicular, there will be another bandgap.
2719000	2723000	However, this bandgap is far from the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2.
2723000	2732000	So for this proof, the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.
2732000	2735000	Here you can see TE mode.
2735000	2738000	D1 and D2 are bandage modes.
2738000	2744000	The frequency of D1 and D2 has a very obvious x-direction structure.
2744000	2749000	For example, D2's intensity is concentrated in the thin part.
2749000	2752000	D1's intensity is concentrated in the thick part.
2752000	2758000	We mainly use these two modes to probe and capture the atoms.
2758000	2765000	TE mode, you can see that it is almost uniform in the direction of the waveguide.
2765000	2770000	TE mode, you can see that it is almost uniform in the direction of the waveguide.
2770000	2775000	Because the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is far from the TEM bandgap,
2775000	2780000	the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.
2780000	2785000	the frequency of C-joint D1 and D2 is like a normal waveguide.
2785000	2792000	This mode is different in that its intensity is the strongest above and below the waveguide.
2792000	2798000	So it has a very useful feature that can help us protect the surface of the device.
2798000	2801000	If you let it be a blue-D-chain, it can bounce away the atoms near it,
2801000	2804000	so that it won't stick to the surface of the device.
2804000	2810000	At the same time, it can produce a large A-structure inside the gap and outside the gap,
2810000	2814000	so that we can detect how many atoms pass through the gap.
2814000	2818000	This is a detail.
2818000	2822000	We just said that using a mode to do trapping is actually a simplification.
2822000	2827000	We need to combine two modes to produce a stable trap on the three-dimensional surface.
2827000	2832000	We need to combine two modes to produce a stable trap on the three-dimensional surface.
2832000	2836000	There is another interesting challenge.
2836000	2843000	We found that to produce a trap, the energy of two modes must have a ratio.
2843000	2848000	If there is no ratio, the trap will not be a stable trap.
2848000	2850000	But there is a problem.
2850000	2855000	The intensity of different frequencies coupled to the waveguide is different.
2855000	2860000	So we can't directly measure how much light is in the waveguide.
2860000	2865000	So how do we know the intensity ratio of two modes?
2865000	2869000	By combining the experiment results and simulation results,
2869000	2874000	we can know how strong the light in the waveguide is.
2876000	2879000	Another purpose of the experiment is to tell us the timing.
2879000	2883000	Here is a way of trapping.
2883000	2886000	When the atom enters the middle of the waveguide,
2886000	2888000	for example, it is in the state f4.
2888000	2892000	When the atom is in the middle, we pump it to the excited state at the right time.
2892000	2895000	When the atom is in the middle, we pump it to the excited state at the right time.
2895000	2900000	We can see that the atom is pumped from a light potential to a deep potential.
2900000	2903000	At this time, the atom can be trapped.
2903000	2906000	Otherwise, the atom will come in and go out again.
2906000	2910000	Because this is a conservative potential.
2910000	2918000	To get this result, we need to know the time of the atom passing the gap.
2918000	2926000	The same simulation can tell us the time of the atom passing the gap.
2932000	2933000	Let's look at this first.
2933000	2935000	I have a question.
2935000	2941000	Does your simulation include interference?
2941000	2945000	For example, environmental, thermal, radiation, etc.
2946000	2950000	Because I don't know what is the background interference of Dominant.
2950000	2952000	Does it include?
2952000	2959000	Thermal radiation, compared to other modes,
2959000	2967000	For example, the strength of the output lattice is hundreds of milliwatts.
2967000	2970000	The Guided Mode contains several microwatts.
2970000	2974000	Their intensity is much greater than thermal radiation.
2974000	2977000	So we don't need to consider thermal radiation.
2977000	2981000	Is there any other known interference that needs to be considered?
2981000	2984000	There is one.
2984000	2986000	It can't be classified as interference.
2986000	2988000	This is a big factor.
2988000	2989000	Casper-Poller force.
2989000	2995000	The atom is very close to the attraction force.
2995000	2999000	If you don't consider the attraction force, the result will be quite different.
2999000	3003000	I didn't think of it at first.
3003000	3007000	But later I found it to be a very important factor.
3007000	3011000	I see. Thank you.
3011000	3014000	There are some interference factors.
3014000	3016000	For example, the vibration of the device.
3016000	3020000	We can think of it as a suspension line.
3020000	3022000	If it heats up, it may vibrate.
3022000	3026000	We have measured the frequency of its vibration.
3026000	3032000	I found that it is much greater than the frequency of the atom vibrating in the trap.
3032000	3035000	So we don't need to consider it for the time being.
3041000	3047000	Let's explain how to calibrate these three different modes.
3047000	3052000	I want to introduce a simple question first.
3052000	3056000	The question is how to calibrate the optical lattice beam.
3056000	3057000	This is not a calibration.
3057000	3059000	Because we already know how strong the optical lattice beam is.
3059000	3062000	It's just a way to verify that this is a feasible method.
3062000	3064000	This is a simulation result.
3064000	3069000	The density of the atom here is much greater than the real density.
3069000	3072000	The real density is only about one-tenth.
3072000	3079000	This simulation result can let us know how the atom moves near the device.
3079000	3086000	The potentials used in this simulation are two optical lattices and the Kessler-Potter force I just mentioned.
3086000	3090000	The atom will be attracted when it is very close to the device.
3090000	3095000	The attraction is the blue potential around it.
3095000	3099000	It is a very strong potential.
3103000	3107000	On the right, we can see the simulated clock spectrum.
3108000	3113000	The atom is attracted by the optical lattice.
3113000	3115000	So it's not coming one by one.
3115000	3119000	We can think of it as passing through the final crystal.
3119000	3122000	It will cause the biggest absorption.
3122000	3126000	It's not zero detuning.
3126000	3128000	Because the optical lattice is red detuning.
3128000	3132000	So it brings a blue detuning.
3132000	3139000	As mentioned before, the red detuning potential will reduce the ground state.
3139000	3141000	But the excited state will be higher.
3141000	3144000	So the overall frequency will also increase.
3144000	3150000	So we can see that the frequency of the atomic transition is a positive detuning.
3150000	3152000	Here we can see that it's going down.
3152000	3158000	This is a phenomenon caused by the Kessler-Potter potential.
3158000	3163000	The Kessler-Potter potential is also an attractive potential.
3163000	3171000	If the excited state doesn't change, the frequency of the atomic transition will also increase.
3171000	3173000	So it's a red detuning.
3173000	3178000	The reason is that the Kessler-Potter potential affects the excited state.
3178000	3181000	For the cesium D1 transition,
3181000	3187000	the change in the excited state is actually twice the ground state.
3187000	3194000	So the decrease in the excited state is actually twice as much as the decrease in the ground state.
3194000	3196000	So in fact, the frequency of the atomic transition is getting smaller.
3196000	3202000	So under the influence of the Kessler-Potter potential, the detuning is negative.
3202000	3205000	We can see that the left is the result of the experiment.
3205000	3207000	So we find that the two are actually quite matched.
3207000	3210000	And the size of the detuning is the same.
3210000	3215000	This means that the parameters of the simulation and the experiment are the same.
3217000	3221000	At this time, we can measure something we don't know.
3221000	3224000	For example, we can measure the length of the TM guided mode.
3224000	3229000	This is a simulation of the TM guided mode.
3229000	3232000	The TM guided mode is a blue detuning.
3232000	3236000	So it generates a negative Kessler-Potter potential above and below the waveguide.
3236000	3241000	So we can see that the atoms are ejected by the Kessler-Potter potential.
3241000	3246000	At the same time, it changes the direction of the atoms entering the gap.
3255000	3260000	The picture on the right is a comparison of the simulation and the experiment.
3260000	3263000	We can see that the simulation of the two-dimensional surface is actually very similar.
3263000	3266000	So their differences are not detailed.
3266000	3270000	However, we can see that the simulation and the experiment are very similar.
3270000	3272000	We can see that after adding this potential,
3272000	3277000	it has some impact on the two-dimensional Kessler-Potter potential.
3277000	3283000	The biggest impact is that you can see that it generates a feature that goes down.
3283000	3294000	This feature is caused by the difference in time when the atoms are ejected by the Kessler-Potter potential.
3296000	3308000	Now we can compare the light energy of the experiment with the simulation.
3308000	3315000	We can see that the light intensity of the simulation is actually less.
3315000	3322000	This is because the light intensity measured in the experiment is the light intensity in the fiber.
3322000	3326000	The light intensity in the waveguide is actually much less.
3326000	3333000	So we can estimate that the fiber coupling efficiency is about 30%.
3333000	3340000	The efficiency is the same as measured in other ways.
3342000	3348000	In this way, we can directly measure the intensity of the light energy in the device.
3353000	3357000	What kind of trajectory does this feature correspond to?
3357000	3364000	We can see that the blue feature corresponds to the blue trajectory on the right.
3364000	3371000	They are outside the device, so they see less guided modes and receive less AC short-circuits.
3371000	3376000	The trajectory that climbs up is the blue guided mode,
3376000	3384000	so it sees a longer value chain, and the frequency is getting lower and lower.
3384000	3394000	In the middle gap, the AC short-circuit corresponds to the green result.
3394000	3404000	We can see that we can use this method to know the time and location of the atoms near the device.
3404000	3411000	There are about 100 ns time resolution and 50 ns space resolution.
3414000	3417000	We can use the same method to do TMO.
3417000	3422000	We can see that it matches quite well.
3422000	3430000	Interestingly, we found that the intensity of the energy in the device is much more than what we put into the experiment.
3430000	3435000	But this is not surprising, because we are using TEMO.
3435000	3439000	TEMO's D1 detour is on the band edge.
3440000	3446000	Because the band edge's group velocity becomes smaller,
3446000	3450000	the intensity of the light inside will be enhanced.
3450000	3456000	The intensity of the light inside the VGAI is greater than what we put into the experiment.
3456000	3459000	This tells us that there is a slow light effect.
3459000	3464000	As I said, there are different types of trajectories.
3464000	3471000	We can separate them in the simulation to see what each of them contributes to the flux vector.
3471000	3475000	For example, the contribution caused by the middle atom,
3475000	3480000	the contribution caused by the outer atom, and the contribution caused by the other blue atoms.
3480000	3483000	This is a very important feature.
3483000	3488000	This is a very important feature.
3488000	3492000	It tells us if there is really an atom passing through the gap.
3492000	3494000	Because this is the atom we want to capture.
3494000	3498000	So we want to know if there is really an atom passing through the gap.
3498000	3504000	We can find that if we take a cut at this time,
3504000	3506000	you will find that there are two dips.
3506000	3511000	The simulation tells us that one of the dips mainly comes from the contribution of the middle atom.
3511000	3513000	The other dip is the contribution of other atoms.
3513000	3519000	So we can observe that there are two dips at this time in the experiment.
3519000	3525000	So it can tell us that there are indeed atoms passing through the gap in the middle.
3525000	3528000	By comparing the simulation results,
3528000	3534000	we can estimate that each pancake will have one or two atoms passing through the gap.
3535000	3538000	At the same time, the simulation also tells us
3538000	3543000	when to pump the atom into the deeper trap.
3543000	3548000	The position of the dip tells us the AC structure over there.
3548000	3554000	So it tells us what frequency of the laser should pump the atom into the deeper trap.
3554000	3558000	By comparing the simulation and the experiment,
3559000	3565000	First, we can calibrate the strength of the guided mode to create the trap we want.
3565000	3568000	Second, it tells us when to pump the atom.
3568000	3574000	Third, it tells us what detuning to use to pump the atom into the trap.
3576000	3580000	Finally, let's talk about the more unexpected result.
3580000	3585000	We can probe how strong the Kasper-Potter force is.
3585000	3586000	For example, there are two simulations.
3586000	3589000	The right one has no Kasper-Potter force.
3589000	3590000	The left one has Kasper-Potter force.
3590000	3597000	The difference is that there is a feature that goes down here.
3597000	3600000	We found that this feature does appear in the experiment.
3600000	3604000	By comparing the two features,
3604000	3610000	we can get the Kasper-Potter potential.
3610000	3616000	The potential coefficient is the same as mentioned in the simulation.
3620000	3630000	Finally, let's talk about the new research I did when I left.
3630000	3638000	A new way to put the chip into the vacuum chamber is very troublesome.
3638000	3645000	You have to stick 16 fibers to the U-Port and then put it into the chamber.
3645000	3648000	It usually takes us two days.
3648000	3651000	The new generation of experiments does not require light.
3651000	3659000	You can directly focus the laser on the coupler with the microscope objective.
3659000	3665000	You can directly couple from the vacuum chamber to the waveguide.
3666000	3670000	This can greatly reduce the time it takes to replace the chip.
3670000	3673000	It also provides more optical access.
3673000	3678000	We can put more beams and have closer observation.
3681000	3687000	Another way is that we can use optical tweezers instead of optical lasers.
3687000	3691000	The advantage of optical lasers is that it gives us a lot of atoms in a short time.
3691000	3696000	The advantage of optical lasers is that it gives us a lot of atoms in a short time.
3696000	3702000	It can extract the information I just mentioned.
3702000	3707000	If you want to fine-tune the position of the atoms, you can use optical tweezers.
3707000	3715000	You can fine-tune the position of the atoms on the one-dimensional waveguide.
3715000	3721000	In this way, you can probe the interaction between two atoms more directly.
3723000	3729000	This is a summary of the applications of the two-dimensional waveguide.
3731000	3735000	This is a summary of the two-dimensional waveguide.
3735000	3740000	First, I talked about why we want to do Strong Atom Photon Interaction.
3740000	3745000	Then, I explained how we send the atoms near the waveguide.
3745000	3750000	Next, I will introduce a numerical simulation.
3750000	3753000	This is a numerical simulation to simulate the trajectory of the atoms.
3753000	3757000	Then, calculate a two-dimensional spectrum from these trajectories.
3757000	3762000	Then, calculate a two-dimensional spectrum from these trajectories.
3762000	3766000	It can help us adjust the strength of the guided mode.
3766000	3770000	It can help us understand the behavior of the atoms near the waveguide.
3770000	3775000	It can help us understand the time and how the neutrino pumps the atoms into the trap.
3775000	3786000	It can help us understand the attraction force of the atoms near the dielectric.
3786000	3788000	Thank you.
3789000	3792000	Thank you, everyone.
3792000	3795000	Let's applaud to thank our speaker today.
3795000	3797000	Please turn on the microphone.
3797000	3801000	Then, we can hear your applause.
3801000	3804000	Thank you for giving us this wonderful speech.
3809000	3814000	Next, we are going to have a Q&A.

3848000	3851000	You can find the way to join
3851000	3853000	on our Facebook page
3853000	3856000	and our website.
3856000	3859000	Now, let's start the Q&A.
3859000	3861000	Any questions?
3861000	3863000	I have a question.
3863000	3866000	What you just said
3866000	3869000	is using Optical Lattice
3869000	3872000	to deliver your origin
3872000	3878000	to the photonic crystal?
3878000	3882000	The ultimate goal is to deliver it
3882000	3885000	to the gap between the two photonic crystals
3885000	3890000	and let the origin stay in the gap.
3890000	3893000	The current method is...
3893000	3896000	Is it possible to easily control
3896000	3898000	the gap between your lattice
3898000	3903000	and the gap between your crystals?
3903000	3905000	This is...
3905000	3907000	This is Optical Lattice's...
3907000	3911000	It consists of two Gaussian beams.
3911000	3914000	We put the photonic crystal waveguide
3914000	3917000	on the position of the Gaussian beam.
3917000	3921000	The position of the beam
3921000	3924000	is about 60 microns.
3924000	3927000	The size of the device
3927000	3929000	is about 1 microns.
3929000	3931000	Most of the origin
3931000	3934000	does not pass
3934000	3936000	near the photonic crystal waveguide.
3936000	3938000	But when each pan can pass,
3938000	3941000	dozens of them
3941000	3943000	will appear near the waveguide.
3943000	3944000	Among those dozens,
3944000	3949000	one or two may run into the gap.
3949000	3953000	I think it can be delivered one-to-one.
3953000	3954000	This is very difficult.
3954000	3959000	Because the gap is 200 nanometers.
3959000	3962000	The wavelength is not that small.
3962000	3964000	Even if you can focus on
3964000	3967000	the wavelength,
3967000	3968000	the Rayleigh Lambda will be very small.
3968000	3970000	So you can't...
3970000	3972000	It's impossible to load
3972000	3974000	such a large mod
3974000	3976000	into the Optical Lattice.
3976000	3978000	After loading,
3978000	3980000	the Rayleigh Lambda is about 2 nanometers.
3980000	3981000	It takes thousands of pancakes
3981000	3983000	to deliver one-to-one.
3983000	3986000	If you focus on such a small wavelength,
3986000	3988000	it's a bit like
3988000	3990000	what I just mentioned,
3990000	3991000	the optical tracer.
3991000	3993000	The optical tracer focuses on
3993000	3995000	the wavelength.
3995000	3996000	Relatively speaking,
3996000	3997000	you can only trap one ray
3997000	4000000	and put it near the waveguide.
4000000	4002000	It has its advantages.
4002000	4003000	The difficulty is that
4003000	4005000	you have to catch a ray
4005000	4007000	and move the ray
4007000	4009000	to the waveguide.
4009000	4011000	You can't lose the ray.
4011000	4013000	So it's difficult.
4016000	4018000	Okay, thank you.
4020000	4022000	I have a question.
4022000	4023000	I want to ask...
4023000	4025000	You said your goal is
4025000	4027000	to achieve strong
4027000	4029000	metroid interaction.
4029000	4031000	I want to ask
4031000	4033000	your long-term goal is
4033000	4036000	when you achieve strong interaction,
4036000	4038000	what do you want to do with it?
4060000	4062000	The main goal is
4062000	4064000	to simulate
4064000	4066000	the system of
4066000	4068000	many-body physics.
4068000	4070000	In addition to
4070000	4072000	the simulation of
4072000	4074000	quantum magnetism,
4074000	4076000	there is another
4076000	4078000	interesting experiment.
4078000	4080000	For example,
4080000	4082000	the cavity QED
4082000	4084000	is a classical object
4084000	4086000	with a large diameter.
4086000	4088000	You can imagine
4088000	4090000	if you catch five atoms
4090000	4092000	and put a side in the middle,
4092000	4094000	the middle is an atom again,
4094000	4096000	and the side is five atoms.
4096000	4098000	The five atoms on the left and right
4098000	4100000	is like a black mirror.
4100000	4102000	That means the atom
4102000	4104000	and the mirror
4104000	4106000	are quantum objects.
4106000	4108000	This is very interesting.
4112000	4114000	Through what I said,
4114000	4116000	you can create
4116000	4118000	pairwise Hamiltonian
4118000	4120000	in quantum simulation.
4120000	4122000	You can create
4122000	4124000	various quantum simulations
4124000	4126000	in pairwise Hamiltonian.
4126000	4128000	There is another interesting
4128000	4130000	application that I didn't mention.
4130000	4132000	This is different from
4132000	4134000	the general waveguide QD,
4134000	4136000	because it has a
4136000	4138000	dielectric structure.
4138000	4140000	This dielectric structure
4140000	4142000	forces the intensity of the light
4142000	4144000	to stick to the structure.
4144000	4146000	So you can make
4146000	4148000	the distance between the atoms
4148000	4150000	smaller than the wavelength
4150000	4152000	of free space.
4152000	4154000	This is an interesting phenomenon.
4154000	4156000	The light radiated
4156000	4158000	to the free space
4158000	4160000	is interfered by the atoms.
4160000	4162000	This can greatly reduce
4162000	4164000	the intensity of spontaneous emission.
4164000	4166000	This is something
4166000	4168000	that general waveguide QD
4168000	4170000	can't do.
4176000	4178000	If you can
4178000	4180000	greatly suppress
4180000	4182000	the frequency of decay
4182000	4184000	to free space,
4184000	4186000	you can make
4186000	4188000	a quantum memory system.
4192000	4194000	Do you have any questions?
4194000	4196000	If not,
4196000	4198000	I have a question.
4198000	4200000	Can you jump to the
4200000	4202000	Kashmir Force page?
4206000	4208000	You can explain
4208000	4210000	what you want to convey
4210000	4212000	in this page.
4212000	4214000	How do you see this?
4214000	4216000	At the beginning of the simulation,
4216000	4218000	we didn't add
4218000	4220000	the Kashmir Force page.
4220000	4222000	You can see that
4222000	4224000	this simulation
4224000	4226000	is the simplest
4226000	4228000	one.
4228000	4230000	We didn't add any
4230000	4232000	guide mode,
4232000	4234000	only probe and optical lattice.
4234000	4236000	The optical lattice
4236000	4238000	is ready-tuned.
4238000	4240000	The light in the whole system
4240000	4242000	is ready-tuned.
4242000	4244000	All the atoms we see
4244000	4246000	should have
4246000	4248000	the same
4248000	4250000	probe frequency
4250000	4252000	to see the atoms.
4252000	4254000	But we found that
4254000	4256000	they all fall down.
4256000	4258000	I found that
4258000	4260000	this is the Kashmir Force.
4260000	4262000	The Kashmir Force
4262000	4264000	is an attraction.
4264000	4266000	The amount of excited state
4266000	4268000	is more than ground state.
4268000	4270000	It can make
4270000	4272000	the probe frequency
4272000	4274000	decrease.
4274000	4276000	You can see the redshift frequency.
4278000	4280000	At the same time,
4280000	4282000	you can see the same phenomenon in CM.
4282000	4284000	If I ask
4284000	4286000	in this way,
4286000	4288000	if you don't add Kashmir Force,
4288000	4290000	the simulation resolution
4290000	4292000	will be too high.
4292000	4294000	If you compare the experimental data,
4294000	4296000	how much inconsistency
4296000	4298000	does it have?
4298000	4300000	For example,
4300000	4302000	we don't know how strong
4302000	4304000	the caterpillar coefficient is.
4304000	4306000	We can extract it in this way.
4306000	4308000	I'm very interested in this.
4310000	4312000	We can get a number
4312000	4314000	which is difficult to measure.
4314000	4316000	There is a reason.
4316000	4318000	The caterpillar
4318000	4320000	has a
4320000	4322000	potential
4322000	4324000	which is
4324000	4326000	1 over z3.
4326000	4328000	It's a
4328000	4330000	1 over z3
4330000	4332000	dependent.
4332000	4334000	It's a
4334000	4336000	very fast
4336000	4338000	potential.
4338000	4340000	The closer it is to the origin,
4340000	4342000	the faster it runs.
4342000	4344000	The interaction time
4344000	4346000	with the deep place is very short.
4346000	4348000	The shift here is
4348000	4350000	negative 20
4350000	4352000	megahertz.
4352000	4354000	It corresponds to
4354000	4356000	1 millikelvin.
4356000	4358000	I don't remember
4358000	4360000	the distance.
4360000	4362000	Maybe it's
4362000	4364000	outside of dozens of nanometers.
4364000	4366000	It's almost gone.
4366000	4368000	We can match
4368000	4370000	the approximate value.
4370000	4372000	If you want to match it accurately,
4372000	4374000	it's hard to do it in this way.
4376000	4378000	Do you publish this?
4378000	4380000	Can I find the details?
4380000	4382000	Yes, we have
4382000	4384000	a paper in PNAS
4384000	4386000	which mentions this.
4386000	4388000	You can send me the link later.
4392000	4394000	The purpose of the paper is not to measure this.
4394000	4396000	I know.
4396000	4398000	My idea is
4398000	4400000	there is a potential
4400000	4402000	which can be optimized
4402000	4404000	to Casimir force detector.
4404000	4406000	Obviously, this is not the purpose.
4406000	4408000	It looks like there is a chance.
4408000	4410000	I'm interested in
4410000	4412000	Casimir force
4412000	4414000	coupled to new physics.
4414000	4416000	I remember there is a paper
4416000	4418000	which uses blue evanescent field
4418000	4420000	to balance the atoms.
4420000	4422000	It can measure
4422000	4424000	Casimir force in this way.
4424000	4426000	It's a bit tiring.
4426000	4428000	We can't design
4428000	4430000	a stable trap
4430000	4432000	to balance it.
4432000	4434000	There is a potential
4434000	4436000	which can be optimized
4436000	4438000	to Casimir force.
4438000	4440000	I think it's cool.
4440000	4442000	We can discuss it later.
4442000	4444000	Do you have any questions?
4446000	4448000	If you don't have any questions,
4448000	4450000	please turn on the microphone.
4450000	4452000	Let's give a round of applause
4452000	4454000	to Peng Lu for his speech.
4454000	4456000	Thank you.
4462000	4464000	Thank you.
