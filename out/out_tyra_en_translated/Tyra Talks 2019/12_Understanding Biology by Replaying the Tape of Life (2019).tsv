0	12000	Thank you, Dr. He Wei-Ching, for giving us an online lecture.
12000	16000	My host today is me, I am Jay Chou.
16000	20000	I am currently working as a postdoc at MD Anderson Cancer Center.
20000	26000	Today I will introduce some of Dr. He Wei-Ching's background.
26000	36000	Dr. He Wei-Ching received her master's degree from the Department of Life Sciences, National Taiwan University, from 2004 to 2008.
36000	46000	She then received her master's degree from the Institute of Zoology, National Taiwan University, from 2008 to 2010.
46000	54000	After receiving her master's degree, she worked as a research assistant at the Department of Life Sciences for one year.
54000	66000	From 2011 to 2017, she received her Ph.D. degree from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan.
66000	76000	After receiving her Ph.D. degree, she is currently working as a postdoc research associate at the Center for the Mechanism of Evolution,
76000	84000	and a postdoc research associate at the Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University.
84000	90000	Today, I am honored to invite Dr. He Wei-Ching to give us an online lecture.
90000	98000	Her topic is Understanding Biology by Replaying the Type of Life, Experimental Evolution of the E. coli as an Example.
98000	102000	Let's welcome Dr. He Wei-Ching to give us an online lecture.
106000	113000	Thank you for the introduction, and thank you, Tara, for giving me the opportunity to share my recent research with you.
114000	129000	I am a biophysicist, and my main concern is to study the diversity of life, how it evolves, and how we can predict the evolution of life.
129000	138000	Today, I am going to share with you some of the experiments that I am doing in the lab, using E. coli as a model species.
139000	142000	I am a postdoc at Arizona State University.
142000	158000	We all know that biodiversity is very diverse in this world.
158000	163000	This problem also confuses many biophysicists.
163000	168000	How do these biodiversity evolve?
168000	185000	Normally, many biophysicists go to the wild to observe these different forms of life, and then try to find some similarities with the different environmental factors in the wild.
185000	190000	Can you explain how these diversities evolve?
191000	201000	However, such research is usually difficult because there are too many environmental factors in the wild, so sometimes the researchers do not know which one to look at.
201000	212000	Therefore, it would be easier for everyone to study the evolution of biodiversity in a situation where there is a better control of mutations.
213000	231000	In this situation, the famous ancient biologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote the book Wonderful Life.
231000	242000	This book mainly talks about the evolution of biodiversity related to the Cambrian explosion in the Berger scale.
242000	248000	More importantly, he proposed an experimental idea in this book.
248000	264000	In other words, if you can see so many diversities on Earth, we will begin to think about whether the biodiversity in the biological world is a natural result of evolution or just a random result.
264000	271000	To distinguish whether it is a natural result or a random result, an experiment may be helpful to explain this.
271000	285000	If you can press a button to wash away the previous biological evolution process to the very, very beginning stage, then you keep pressing the play button,
285000	291000	and every time you press the play button, you will see if the biological evolution will have the same result.
291000	300000	If this happens repeatedly, it means that the diversity we see is a natural result of evolution, not a random result.
300000	315000	At the time of this idea, he said in the book that he was very sad, because in fact this kind of experiment can only be thought of, and there is no way to do it.
315000	330000	However, in recent years, due to the development of experimental technologies in the laboratory and the progress of various molecular technologies, many people have tried to do so-called experimental evolution in the laboratory.
330000	340000	In the process of experimental evolution, we can repeat many times of evolution and do it in a better environment.
340000	353000	The most famous experimental evolution is Richard Alensky's E. coli long-term experimental evolution.
354000	362000	This is Richard Alensky and his E. coli long-term population.
363000	371000	He started doing this experiment in 1988, and so far there have been more than 60,000 generations.
372000	383000	He put the E. coli in the Glucose Minimum Media and passed it on to the new media every day.
384000	400000	When he started this experiment, he had a total of 12 parallel populations, so he repeated the evolution process 12 times.
401000	415000	Over the course of more than 20 years of evolution, his laboratory sent a lot of documents to introduce what happened to his E. coli.
416000	425000	In his reports on different phenotypes and genotypes, he also found different levels of repetition.
425000	433000	For example, in all of his populations, he saw an increase in fitness and even an increase in cell size.
433000	436000	He argued that this may be related to nutrient acquisition.
437000	445000	However, in all of his populations, he only observed that half of the population would evolve to a higher rate of mutation.
446000	466000	What he found more novel was that in all 12 populations, there was one population that evolved to use another chemical in the environment, citrate, as a carbon source of nutrient composition.
467000	479000	At the same time, he also observed some parallelism on genotypes, which means that some mutations are easier to detect than other mutations.
480000	485000	At the same time, he also saw that within this population, they began to form population structures.
486000	497000	However, after these discoveries, we have to ask, because he was only doing this in the same environment.
498000	510000	If we want to fully understand how to predict the results of a mutation, we are not sure whether the phenomena he observed only occurred in the environment he started or in the bacteria he used.
510000	518000	What is more important is that there are many different types of evolutionary forces in the process of mutation.
519000	527000	Different evolutionary forces have different types, some of which will lead to de-mutation, some of which will lead to evolution, and so on.
527000	542000	If we want to better understand the predictability of mutation, we will want to understand that these different evolutionary forces are related to different types of mutations.
542000	546000	In the process of evolution, there are many different forces that will result in evolution.
546000	558000	The most famous is the natural selection. The natural selection will lead to deterministic results, and the deterministic results will lead to deterministic results.
558000	573000	In the process of evolution, there are many different forces that will result in evolution. The most famous is the natural selection.
573000	592000	The natural selection will lead to deterministic results, because if your genotype is higher than the fitness of other genotypes, the genotype will spread faster in the population.
593000	603000	However, evolution is not only the natural selection of a force. Many other forces are also very important, and they play a random role.
603000	615000	For example, mutation is the most basic force of evolution. Without mutation, it is basically impossible to produce a new shape.
616000	627000	Another force is recombination. Recombination allows different species to get a new combination of genetic material.
627000	635000	Another force, genetic drift, will also cause random changes.
636000	642000	Here are some examples of genetic drift.
642000	658000	Basically, genetic drift is the change in the frequency of genetic material in the evolution process of life.
659000	671000	You can imagine that there are some unpredictable factors in the evolution process, such as natural disasters that cause population size changes.
672000	683000	Interestingly, if the population size is smaller in the genetic drift effect, the genetic drift effect will be stronger.
683000	688000	Sometimes it will be so strong that the natural selection effect is overshadowed.
688000	696000	The following two graphs are simulation results.
697000	713000	This graph simulates the frequency of genetic mutations as the number of generations increases.
713000	731000	If there are only 20 individuals in this group, you will see that after the 10th and 20th generations, the mutation may jump from the original 0.5 frequency to 1.
731000	741000	This means that the entire population has this variation, or this variation is gone when the frequency of its variation becomes 0.
742000	749000	However, if the population size is 2000, you will see that the frequency of its variation is very small.
749000	756000	What is the significance of this in evolution?
756000	772000	It is because sometimes, as we just said, in the evolution process of the population, it may encounter some natural disasters or other environmental changes that cause the decline in the population size.
773000	780000	So there is a very famous example of genetic drift called the bottleneck effect.
780000	795000	As shown in this graph, if the population size is very large at the very beginning on the far left, then the balls of different colors seem to be different genetic variations.
795000	799000	At the beginning, the genetic composition may be very consistent.
799000	810000	However, when the population size begins to decline, you can imagine that only a small number of balls are drawn from many, many balls.
810000	813000	At this time, the genetic composition will change significantly.
813000	824000	When the population size decreases more and more, the frequency of genetic variation will change even more.
824000	832000	For example, in the end, you will find that the red part has gone from 20% to 70%.
843000	856000	Because there are different forces in the evolution process, we have carried out a lot of different experiments in the Lynch Lab where I am now.
856000	863000	We want to test whether the evolution forces of different species will change the evolution results.
864000	872000	In particular, we pay special attention to the impact of the mutation rate and the population bottlenecks.
874000	889000	In addition, we also want to try to see what would happen if the experimental evolution was carried out in a more complex environment.
889000	898000	In the previous Lynch Lab evolution process, the environment was relatively monotonous, with only glucose as its carbon source.
898000	917000	In our experimental design, we first chose a more complex cultivator, the LB cultivator.
918000	926000	In the LB cultivator, there are many different amino acids that can be used as the source of carbon.
927000	933000	In addition, we do not use the tracing bottle for experiments, but use the lynch lab for experiments.
933000	945000	When doing experiments in the lynch lab, you can imagine that there may be some differences in the degree of T in the entire lynch lab.
945000	950000	For example, the concentration of oxygen may be higher at the top and lower at the bottom.
950000	955000	We use this method to make the experimental environment more complex.
955000	967000	In addition, we want to know the impact of the mutation rate on the experimental results.
968000	975000	Therefore, we tried to use different genetic backgrounds to carry out the experimental evolution.
976000	991000	We used the MUTEL gene in the wild type LB cultivator.
992000	1000000	Previous experiments have shown that if there is this gene, the mutation rate will increase by 150 times.
1001000	1012000	The reason for this is that MUTEL is a very important molecule in the mismatch repair, as shown in the figure on the right.
1013000	1020000	That is, when there is a mismatch in the DNA, for example, G should not be paired with T.
1021000	1039000	When this mismatch is detected by MUTEL and MUTX, it will recruit MUTH and other pathways to do DNA repair and put the correct pairing back.
1040000	1047000	This is why the mutation rate will increase by more than 150 times after MUTEL is deleted.
1048000	1061000	At the same time, if it is in the usual wild type environment, you can imagine that its mutation rate is very low, about 10 to the minus 10 per base per generation.
1069000	1076000	At the same time, we also used different dilution factors in the experimental setup.
1077000	1081000	We have just introduced the start of different genetic backgrounds.
1082000	1089000	For each genetic background, we also tried three different bottleneck sizes.
1090000	1094000	Next, I will use small, medium, and large to represent different bottleneck sizes.
1094000	1097000	But the actual dilution factor is listed here.
1098000	1110000	If it is the smallest bottleneck, there will be one-tenth of the population entering the new tube from the old cultivator to the new cultivator tube every day.
1111000	1117000	You can imagine that only one-tenth of the original population size will enter the new tube.
1118000	1122000	If it is medium, it is one-fourth of 10.
1122000	1128000	The strongest bottleneck is one-tenth of 10.
1129000	1136000	Because we want to see if the results of different bottlenecks are repetitive,
1137000	1143000	we have eight repetitions in each genetic background and dilution factor treatment.
1143000	1153000	This experiment has been carried out in Lynch Lab for three or four years.
1154000	1161000	Today, I would like to share with you the results of the 900th day dilution.
1161000	1180000	The first question is, after 900 days, is their adaptability better than before?
1181000	1186000	To answer this question, our strategy is to do a competition assay.
1187000	1191000	The logic is quite simple.
1192000	1201000	At the beginning, we took some of the evolved population and some of the ancestor population.
1202000	1207000	After putting them in the same tube and mixing them, we immediately measured the ratio between them.
1208000	1214000	After 24 hours, let them compete with each other inside and then measure the ratio again.
1214000	1217000	In this way, we have the later ratio and the earlier ratio.
1218000	1226000	By comparing these two ratios, we can know how much the fitness of the evolved population has improved compared to the ancestor population.
1227000	1234000	Then we do this to different parallel populations of different treatments.
1234000	1242000	This is the result of the experiment.
1243000	1247000	On the x-axis, we have some different treatments with different numbers.
1248000	1254000	Different treatments, such as whether the population bottleneck size is small or large,
1255000	1262000	or whether the genetic background is the high-transmission rate of MMR- or wild type, are listed above.
1262000	1269000	The y-axis is the fitness improvement relative to ancestor.
1270000	1277000	We measured at least three populations for each treatment,
1278000	1281000	and at least three replicates for each evolved line.
1282000	1289000	This result shows that after doing the two-way ANOVA test,
1290000	1297000	we found that different genetic backgrounds did not have a significant impact.
1298000	1304000	But the bottleneck size has a significant impact.
1304000	1311000	From this graph, we can see that if the bottleneck size is medium or large,
1312000	1319000	the fitness improvement is actually very small, much smaller than the small population bottleneck.
1320000	1322000	This is calculated.
1322000	1345000	Because we see the fitness improvement, we want to ask if the genetic material changes are consistent with the fitness changes.
1346000	1354000	During the experiment, we did a high-throughput sequencing every 100 days.
1355000	1358000	After doing the high-throughput DNA sequencing,
1359000	1366000	we used the Briseeq software to derive the allele frequency.
1367000	1377000	Briseeq was developed to map the Lenski Long-Term Experimental Evolution software.
1378000	1388000	After the map was derived, we measured the amount of mutation for each time point.
1388000	1397000	The amount of mutation was used to add up the derived allele frequency.
1398000	1410000	In addition, because the population bottleneck size is different in different treatments,
1410000	1418000	it is possible that the bacteria that pass through the evolution process are different in generation.
1419000	1426000	During the experiment, we found that no matter how small or large the bottleneck is,
1427000	1433000	it can grow back to the maximum possible number of the population in one day.
1433000	1440000	So we use this to estimate the generation number of bacteria.
1441000	1450000	The smallest 1 over 10 dilution factor is calculated to be about 3.3 generations per day.
1451000	1457000	The largest population bottleneck can reach 23 generations per day.
1458000	1469000	After obtaining these data, we plot them on this graph.
1470000	1474000	On this graph, the x-axis shows the number of generations,
1475000	1476000	and 1000 is the unit.
1477000	1481000	The y-axis shows the number of mutations.
1481000	1488000	SNP stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism.
1489000	1496000	We take the average between different parallel experimental evolutions.
1497000	1504000	You can see that the amount of mutation is very linear.
1505000	1512000	Next, we want to compare the different treatments.
1513000	1521000	Is there a difference in the speed of accumulation of the number of mutations on the gene?
1522000	1528000	The B in each treatment graph is the regression slope.
1529000	1535000	If we compare the MMR minus, which is a higher mutation rate,
1536000	1538000	with the wild type, which is a lower mutation rate,
1539000	1542000	and compare them with the same population bottleneck size,
1543000	1545000	the MMR minus is higher.
1545000	1558000	However, the higher MMR minus is only 4 to 20 times higher,
1559000	1563000	less than 150 times higher than the initial mutation rate.
1564000	1570000	If we compare the different population bottlenecks,
1570000	1577000	we will find that the higher the population bottleneck size,
1578000	1585000	the lower the accumulation rate of mutations on the gene.
1586000	1590000	Can I ask a question?
1591000	1592000	Sure.
1592000	1602000	The MMR mutation rate is 150 times higher than the wild type.
1603000	1604000	Yes.
1605000	1610000	Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR minus
1611000	1614000	has a higher mutation rate than the wild type?
1614000	1624000	Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR minus has a higher mutation rate than the wild type?
1625000	1626000	Yes.
1627000	1633000	Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR minus has a higher mutation rate than the wild type?
1634000	1635000	Yes.
1635000	1640000	First of all, they look similar, but the Y-axis is different.
1641000	1642000	I forgot to mention this.
1643000	1650000	You can see that the Y-axis is 10 times higher than the wild type.
1651000	1655000	Although the mutation rate looks the same on the graph,
1656000	1664000	the MMR minus mutation rate is 10 times higher than the wild type.
1665000	1672000	The MMR minus mutation rate is 10 times higher than the wild type.
1673000	1683000	Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR mutation rate is 150 times higher than the wild type?
1684000	1685000	Yes.
1685000	1693000	At the beginning, when I was talking about the MMR minus genetic background,
1694000	1695000	I didn't say it very clearly.
1696000	1701000	In fact, 150 times is the result of the experiment.
1702000	1707000	I guess I will talk about the method of experiment testing in the next slide.
1708000	1713000	The method of experiment testing is the so-called universal accumulation experiment.
1714000	1717000	We call it the mutation accumulation experiment.
1718000	1724000	In the process of this experiment, we will raise these bacteria in the same way.
1725000	1729000	But in the process of raising, we give it a very strong bottleneck.
1730000	1737000	That is to say, every time we pass it on, we only pick one colony to pass on.
1737000	1742000	So you can imagine that unless the mutation kills the bacteria,
1743000	1748000	otherwise all mutations can be retained in the bacteria.
1749000	1753000	In the process of this mutation accumulation experiment,
1754000	1764000	it is passed on for more than 60 days with only one colony left every day.
1765000	1783000	In this way, you can know how many new mutations have occurred after 60 days.
1784000	1788000	Then the new mutation is divided by the number of generations and the mutation rate is obtained.
1788000	1791000	The mutation rate mentioned in the first slide,
1792000	1795000	For example, the 10 to the power of 10 times per base pair per generation,
1796000	1798000	is measured like this.
1800000	1808000	In today's presentation, we have used another faster way.
1809000	1812000	We will discuss this later.
1813000	1819000	At the same time, we are also using the mutation accumulation method
1820000	1822000	to measure the evolved mutation rate.
1823000	1825000	Indeed, as I mentioned earlier,
1826000	1828000	there is a very intuitive explanation,
1829000	1831000	that is, the mutation rate dropped during the evolution process,
1832000	1834000	and our data also shows this.
1843000	1846000	This is what I just explained.
1847000	1851000	In the experiment process,
1852000	1857000	there is another group of experiments to measure the evolved mutation rate.
1858000	1861000	This is the so-called mutation accumulation experiment.
1862000	1866000	There are many parallel experiments.
1867000	1869000	The point is that every time we transfer,
1869000	1872000	we lose a very, very strong population bottleneck.
1873000	1875000	There is probably only one group.
1876000	1878000	Then we have to try to keep all the mutations.
1879000	1884000	So after this process,
1885000	1886000	we can imagine,
1887000	1890000	we can use host-genome sequencing to see how many mutations there are.
1891000	1893000	Then we can measure the mutation rate.
1894000	1898000	This kind of mutation rate should be the evolution rate of the genome.
1899000	1903000	If the following things are correct,
1904000	1906000	first, if the mutation rate has not changed,
1907000	1910000	second, if there is no subpopulation structure.
1911000	1913000	Because if there is a subpopulation structure,
1914000	1919000	it will limit the number of mutations in each new genome
1919000	1925000	to the extent that it cannot spread to the entire group.
1926000	1928000	So the evolution rate is also reduced.
1929000	1931000	In addition, we have to assume that
1932000	1936000	if all the mutations do not kill the bacteria,
1937000	1938000	it has no effect on fitness.
1944000	1947000	Because in the previous paper,
1947000	1954000	I have measured the mutation rate of MAR- and wild-type.
1955000	1956000	Then in this picture,
1957000	1961000	I drew it on the virtual line.
1962000	1964000	That is to say, the virtual line means
1965000	1967000	if the assumption was established before,
1968000	1969000	that is, the evolution rate has not changed,
1970000	1972000	then all the mutations have no effect on fitness,
1973000	1975000	and then there is no subpopulation structure,
1975000	1978000	then we would expect to see
1979000	1981000	so many mutations shown on the virtual line.
1984000	1986000	But we can see that
1987000	1989000	in the virtual expectation
1990000	1993000	and the actual color line observation,
1994000	2000000	the actual evolution rate observed by MAR-
2000000	2005000	is lower than the virtual line.
2007000	2010000	On the other hand, the wild-type is actually higher.
2011000	2014000	So there are some different hypotheses
2015000	2016000	to explain this.
2017000	2018000	Hello, I have another question.
2019000	2022000	Is the virtual line and the actual line
2023000	2026000	experimental environment completely identical?
2027000	2028000	Yes, they are all LB.
2028000	2031000	And they are all column-shaped bottles.
2032000	2034000	Yes, this is a bit different.
2035000	2037000	Because in the MAR-experiment,
2038000	2039000	the method of transmission,
2040000	2041000	because we have to pick the single colony,
2042000	2043000	so it is done on the side plate.
2044000	2045000	This may be a bit different.
2046000	2047000	I see.
2052000	2056000	Yes, so there is a possible assumption that
2056000	2060000	the MAR-line has a lower mutation rate,
2061000	2064000	while the wild-type has a higher mutation rate,
2065000	2066000	which may explain this.
2069000	2071000	This picture is mainly to say
2072000	2073000	that the phenomenon we just saw
2074000	2078000	is not caused by one or two lines.
2079000	2084000	If I draw the slope of each line,
2084000	2089000	you will find that they are actually quite consistent.
2090000	2093000	For example, in the MAR-line,
2094000	2100000	each block is a different parallel population.
2101000	2104000	Then you will find that they are all lower than the virtual line.
2105000	2110000	The virtual line is the expected rate in the MA-experiment.
2111000	2114000	In the wild-type, each one is higher.
2116000	2118000	So the average phenomenon just now
2119000	2121000	is not just caused by one or two lines.
2122000	2123000	It is a very broad phenomenon.
2124000	2126000	Another interesting point is
2127000	2128000	if you look closely,
2129000	2130000	in the wild-type background,
2131000	2133000	the smallest is the small dilution factor.
2134000	2136000	You will find that there are two or three points
2136000	2139000	where the outlier is divided into two groups.
2140000	2141000	This means that
2142000	2144000	during the evolution process,
2145000	2147000	the two points at the top,
2148000	2149000	the two parallel populations,
2150000	2152000	may have evolved a high mutation rate
2153000	2154000	compared to others.
2154000	2166000	In the method of measuring the mutation rate,
2167000	2169000	in addition to the MA-experiment just mentioned,
2170000	2172000	there is another method called the fluctuation test.
2173000	2175000	This method will be faster
2176000	2178000	because it does not need to go through
2179000	2181000	several months of generation and cultivation.
2181000	2183000	In the end, there is no need for high-throughput sequencing.
2184000	2186000	But it will be less accurate.
2187000	2189000	The principle of this fluctuation test is
2190000	2191000	if the line at the beginning
2192000	2194000	is antibiotic-sensitive,
2196000	2197000	then
2199000	2201000	if it encounters antibiotics,
2202000	2203000	these will die.
2204000	2206000	Like these blue and black dots.
2206000	2207000	Then,
2208000	2210000	if we start cultivating
2211000	2213000	the same group of bacteria
2214000	2216000	with different tubes,
2217000	2218000	you can imagine that
2219000	2221000	they will each produce a new mutation
2222000	2224000	because they start to reproduce themselves.
2225000	2226000	In the process of reproduction,
2227000	2228000	they may get a new mutation.
2229000	2231000	In these new mutations,
2231000	2233000	some of them will cause the bacteria
2234000	2238000	to gain the ability of antibiotic resistance.
2239000	2240000	In this picture,
2241000	2242000	there are those white dots.
2243000	2244000	Then,
2245000	2247000	after several generations,
2248000	2250000	after a period of reproduction,
2251000	2253000	we will put the bacteria inside
2254000	2257000	on the plate of the antibiotic cultivator
2258000	2259000	to calculate
2259000	2261000	how many colonies there are.
2262000	2263000	This means
2264000	2265000	how many new individuals
2266000	2269000	have antibiotic resistance.
2270000	2273000	We can compare different bacteria.
2274000	2276000	If more colonies are found
2277000	2279000	at the end of the test,
2280000	2281000	it means that
2282000	2283000	the potential mutation rate is higher.
2289000	2290000	So,
2291000	2292000	the method of
2293000	2294000	measuring the mutation rate
2295000	2296000	is to use
2297000	2299000	the reprimising antibiotic
2300000	2301000	to measure.
2302000	2303000	Then,
2304000	2305000	we took some
2306000	2308000	clones that had just evolved
2309000	2310000	to do the experiment.
2311000	2312000	Then,
2314000	2315000	we also did the
2316000	2317000	ancestor test.
2317000	2319000	We also did the
2320000	2322000	ancestor mutation rate test.
2323000	2324000	It is worth noting that
2325000	2326000	the mutation rate here is not the previous
2327000	2329000	per base pair per generation.
2330000	2331000	It is a mutation rate
2332000	2334000	related to antibiotic resistance.
2335000	2336000	However,
2337000	2339000	we can still compare the relative changes between them.
2340000	2342000	We found that in the MMR-line,
2343000	2345000	the ancestor mutation rate
2345000	2346000	is actually
2347000	2348000	about 10 to the power of 6.
2349000	2350000	However,
2351000	2352000	in the Evolv-line,
2353000	2354000	we found that
2355000	2356000	the mutation rate is reduced
2357000	2358000	by about 20 to 40 times,
2359000	2360000	as shown in the figure.
2361000	2363000	However, in the wild type,
2364000	2365000	this phenomenon is not obvious.
2366000	2367000	You can see that their
2368000	2369000	error bars are basically overlapped.
2370000	2371000	Or,
2372000	2373000	in some cases,
2373000	2374000	the mutation rate is very large.
2375000	2376000	So, we think
2377000	2379000	that the wild type mutation rate
2380000	2381000	may not have much change
2382000	2383000	in these lines.
2384000	2385000	The change is relatively small.
2386000	2387000	However, in the ML-line,
2388000	2389000	the mutation rate is low.
2390000	2391000	This may be
2392000	2393000	one of the explanations for the phenomenon.
2398000	2399000	Of course,
2400000	2401000	this is just a few lines.
2401000	2402000	We are currently measuring
2403000	2404000	more lines.
2409000	2410000	Another possible factor
2411000	2412000	is the stop-population structure.
2413000	2414000	The stop-population structure
2415000	2416000	is actually
2417000	2418000	what the researchers
2419000	2420000	in the Lynch Lab
2421000	2422000	found before.
2423000	2424000	They found that
2425000	2426000	if the environment of the tube
2427000	2428000	is used,
2429000	2430000	it is easy to cause
2431000	2432000	a mutation.
2433000	2434000	It is a bit like
2435000	2436000	what is shown in this picture.
2437000	2438000	At first, the bacteria
2439000	2440000	may be in a plantonic state,
2441000	2442000	which means that
2443000	2444000	it can incubate inside.
2445000	2446000	However, after the mutation,
2447000	2448000	some bacteria may develop
2449000	2450000	and form a biological membrane
2451000	2452000	on the surface.
2453000	2454000	In this case,
2455000	2456000	it will cause
2457000	2458000	a difference in the structure of the group.
2459000	2460000	Previously,
2461000	2462000	in the long-term
2463000	2464000	E. coli evolution
2465000	2466000	of Richard Lenski,
2467000	2468000	they developed
2469000	2470000	the Hidden Markov Model
2471000	2472000	to see
2473000	2474000	how the
2475000	2476000	stop-population structure
2477000	2478000	in the population
2479000	2480000	changes.
2482000	2483000	He used
2484000	2485000	the Hidden Markov Model
2486000	2487000	to assume
2488000	2489000	that
2490000	2491000	different mutations
2492000	2493000	in the population
2494000	2495000	may be in different clades.
2496000	2497000	He assumed that
2498000	2499000	there is a major clade
2500000	2501000	and a minor clade.
2502000	2503000	The Hidden Markov Chain
2504000	2505000	assumes that
2506000	2507000	a mutation
2508000	2509000	can change
2510000	2511000	the frequency
2512000	2513000	in the basal clade,
2514000	2515000	major clade,
2516000	2517000	or minor clade
2518000	2519000	in the basal clade.
2520000	2521000	On the left,
2522000	2523000	this is a very complicated picture.
2524000	2525000	He used
2526000	2527000	the Hidden Markov Chain Model
2528000	2529000	to identify
2530000	2531000	some mutations,
2532000	2533000	as shown in the above picture,
2534000	2535000	that can
2536000	2537000	successfully spread
2538000	2539000	to the entire population
2540000	2541000	by increasing
2542000	2543000	the allele frequency
2544000	2545000	to 1.
2546000	2547000	However,
2548000	2549000	these mutations
2550000	2551000	may have
2552000	2553000	substructure evidence
2554000	2555000	in the population.
2559000	2560000	I did the same
2561000	2562000	analysis of the
2563000	2564000	Markov Chain Model.
2565000	2566000	I used
2567000	2568000	the analysis
2569000	2570000	to estimate
2571000	2572000	how long
2573000	2574000	the two
2575000	2576000	mutations
2576000	2577000	in the basal clade
2578000	2579000	and the minor clade
2580000	2581000	and the major clade
2582000	2583000	can be observed.
2584000	2585000	In this picture,
2586000	2587000	there are different
2588000	2589000	population bottlenecks
2590000	2591000	and different genetic backgrounds.
2592000	2593000	The histogram
2594000	2595000	is the distribution
2596000	2597000	of coexistence time.
2598000	2599000	We found that
2600000	2601000	ML-
2602000	2603000	tends to
2604000	2605000	have longer
2606000	2607000	clade
2608000	2609000	and
2610000	2611000	is marginally
2612000	2613000	significant.
2614000	2615000	It is possible that
2616000	2617000	the ML-
2618000	2619000	bottlenecks
2620000	2621000	make the population
2622000	2623000	structure
2623000	2624000	more likely to occur,
2625000	2626000	which causes
2627000	2628000	the evolutionary rate
2629000	2630000	to be less than
2631000	2632000	the initial
2633000	2634000	ancestor mutation
2634000	2635000	of the
2636000	2637000	ML-
2638000	2639000	clade.
2640000	2641000	Next,
2642000	2643000	we are going to
2644000	2645000	look at
2646000	2647000	the nature selection effect.
2648000	2649000	When we look at
2650000	2651000	the nature selection effect,
2652000	2653000	we tend to look at
2654000	2655000	different pore mutations.
2656000	2657000	Different pore mutations
2658000	2659000	have different
2660000	2661000	perception of
2662000	2663000	nature selection.
2664000	2665000	Different DNA
2666000	2667000	sequences
2668000	2669000	produce different
2670000	2671000	protein sequences.
2672000	2673000	We call some mutations
2674000	2675000	synonymous mutations.
2676000	2677000	This means that
2678000	2679000	although the DNA sequence
2680000	2681000	changes,
2681000	2682000	the protein sequence
2683000	2684000	does not change.
2685000	2686000	For example,
2687000	2688000	in this green example,
2689000	2690000	G becomes A,
2691000	2692000	but it is still glycine.
2692000	2693000	Because it changes
2694000	2695000	in the first place of the codon,
2696000	2697000	the original glycine
2698000	2699000	becomes arginine.
2701000	2702000	So you can imagine that
2702000	2703000	if this non-synonymous mutation
2704000	2705000	causes a change in the amino
2706000	2707000	acid sequence,
2708000	2709000	this mutation
2710000	2711000	may cause
2712000	2713000	a stronger nature selection
2714000	2715000	because it changes the protein sequence,
2716000	2717000	which will negatively affect the protein function.
2723000	2724000	In the analysis,
2725000	2726000	we only focus on
2727000	2728000	non-synonymous mutations,
2729000	2730000	which may cause
2731000	2732000	a change in the protein function.
2735000	2736000	Then,
2737000	2738000	we need to detect
2739000	2740000	this parallelism mutation.
2742000	2743000	The method we use is
2744000	2745000	G-score.
2746000	2747000	Here is a simple example.
2749000	2750000	For example,
2750000	2751000	there are
2752000	2753000	gene A,
2753000	2754000	gene B,
2754000	2755000	gene C,
2755000	2756000	and then
2756000	2757000	there are six replicates
2758000	2759000	in the experiment.
2760000	2761000	Then
2761000	2762000	each gene may have
2763000	2764000	ten
2765000	2766000	non-synonymous sites.
2768000	2769000	If
2770000	2771000	this parallelism
2772000	2773000	does not favor any gene,
2774000	2775000	like the example here,
2776000	2777000	there are two, two, two.
2778000	2779000	Then
2780000	2781000	we can calculate
2781000	2782000	this G-score will be zero.
2783000	2784000	So when the G-score is very low,
2785000	2786000	it means
2787000	2788000	that no gene
2789000	2790000	is particularly easy to be mutated.
2792000	2793000	But the following example
2794000	2795000	shows that if a certain gene
2796000	2797000	is easy to be mutated,
2797000	2798000	such as gene A,
2799000	2800000	like this example,
2801000	2802000	there are also six mutations in total,
2803000	2804000	but these six mutations
2805000	2806000	only occur in A,
2807000	2808000	but not in B and C.
2808000	2809000	If these six mutations
2810000	2811000	occur in A,
2812000	2813000	the final result
2814000	2815000	will make the G-score very high.
2816000	2817000	That is to say,
2818000	2819000	the high or low G-score
2820000	2821000	can tell us
2822000	2823000	whether certain genes
2824000	2825000	are particularly easy to mutate.
2828000	2829000	There are some different
2830000	2831000	biological meanings
2832000	2833000	to explain the higher G-score
2834000	2835000	we see.
2836000	2837000	For example,
2838000	2839000	if a gene
2840000	2841000	has a relatively strong
2842000	2843000	beneficial effect,
2844000	2845000	it is easier to be retained
2846000	2847000	in the selection.
2848000	2849000	Then it may show
2850000	2851000	a higher G-score.
2852000	2853000	It is also possible that
2854000	2855000	there are a lot of mutations
2856000	2857000	in that gene
2858000	2859000	that have beneficial effects.
2860000	2861000	But in addition to
2862000	2863000	beneficial effects
2864000	2865000	and natural selection-related results,
2866000	2867000	it is also possible
2868000	2869000	that there are different mutations
2870000	2871000	in different genome regions.
2874000	2875000	Therefore,
2876000	2877000	in order to
2878000	2879000	really observe
2880000	2881000	the effect of natural selection,
2882000	2883000	we only consider
2884000	2885000	fixed mutations.
2886000	2887000	The so-called fixed mutations
2888000	2889000	are those mutations
2890000	2891000	that have spread
2892000	2893000	throughout the entire group.
2894000	2895000	Such mutations
2896000	2897000	are usually not just
2898000	2899000	a bias,
2900000	2901000	but they can spread
2901000	2902000	within the group.
2907000	2908000	Another point is
2909000	2910000	how many total
2911000	2912000	non-senitive mutations
2913000	2914000	will affect
2915000	2916000	the G-score itself.
2918000	2919000	In this picture,
2920000	2921000	if we simulate the G-score
2922000	2923000	and start with some different numbers,
2924000	2925000	you will find that
2926000	2927000	the higher the number
2928000	2929000	of G-scores,
2930000	2931000	the higher the G-score itself.
2932000	2933000	Therefore,
2934000	2935000	when we compare,
2936000	2937000	we can't just observe the G-score.
2938000	2939000	We also need to use
2940000	2941000	how many mutations
2942000	2943000	to simulate
2944000	2945000	and compare the value of observation
2946000	2947000	and the value of simulation.
2952000	2953000	So this picture is
2955000	2956000	the result of gene-level parallelism.
2957000	2958000	The triangle part
2959000	2960000	is the actual observed
2961000	2962000	G-score.
2964000	2965000	The histogram part
2966000	2967000	is the simulation part.
2968000	2969000	Based on the simulated distribution
2971000	2972000	and the observed value,
2973000	2974000	we can calculate the Z-value.
2975000	2976000	The Z-value
2977000	2978000	tells us
2979000	2980000	how significant
2981000	2982000	the gene-level parallelism is.
2983000	2984000	The higher the value,
2984000	2985000	the more significant it is.
2986000	2987000	In this result,
2988000	2989000	we can see that
2990000	2991000	first of all,
2992000	2993000	the MR-value
2994000	2995000	has more gene-level parallelism.
2996000	2997000	It may be because
2998000	2999000	the mutation rate is higher,
3000000	3001000	so it may be able to
3002000	3003000	search for more mutations,
3005000	3007000	resulting in a stronger selection effect.
3014000	3015000	At the same time,
3016000	3017000	we can only see
3018000	3019000	if a single gene
3020000	3021000	shows a strong G-score.
3022000	3023000	This picture
3024000	3025000	is the result of
3026000	3027000	the statistical test.
3030000	3031000	So we have listed
3032000	3033000	some different genes
3034000	3035000	that show
3036000	3037000	an effect on
3038000	3039000	gene-level parallelism.
3041000	3042000	Then we can
3043000	3044000	analyze
3044000	3045000	the special
3046000	3047000	clustering function
3048000	3049000	of these genes.
3050000	3051000	We have obtained
3052000	3053000	several possible candidates,
3054000	3055000	such as those with special
3056000	3057000	enzyme activity
3058000	3059000	or those
3060000	3061000	related to
3062000	3063000	transcription regulation.
3065000	3066000	Interestingly,
3067000	3068000	some genes
3069000	3070000	are identified
3071000	3072000	as being
3072000	3073000	gene-level parallelism.
3074000	3075000	For example,
3076000	3077000	FinH, FinE, FinB, FinG
3078000	3079000	are all related to
3080000	3081000	type I fibrillate structure
3082000	3083000	or regulation.
3084000	3085000	In E.coli,
3086000	3087000	type I fibrillate
3088000	3089000	is related to
3090000	3091000	stress response
3092000	3093000	and mobility.
3094000	3095000	Perhaps these genes
3096000	3097000	can help
3098000	3099000	E.coli
3099000	3100000	to grow.
3105000	3106000	After identifying
3107000	3108000	these genes,
3109000	3110000	our next goal
3111000	3112000	is to test
3113000	3114000	whether these genes
3115000	3116000	can increase
3116000	3117000	E.coli fitness.
3119000	3120000	We also detected
3121000	3122000	some nucleotide-level
3123000	3124000	parallelism.
3124000	3125000	This is
3126000	3127000	the nucleotide-level
3127000	3128000	parallelism
3129000	3130000	distribution.
3131000	3132000	X-axis
3133000	3134000	shows
3135000	3136000	how many nucleotide
3137000	3138000	mutations can be seen
3139000	3140000	in different parallel
3141000	3142000	experiments.
3144000	3145000	There are also
3146000	3147000	different population
3148000	3149000	bottleneck sizes
3149000	3150000	and different genetic backgrounds.
3151000	3152000	We also found
3152000	3153000	nucleotide-level
3153000	3154000	parallelism.
3155000	3156000	In other words,
3156000	3157000	mutations
3158000	3159000	such as point mutations
3160000	3161000	can be observed
3161000	3162000	in different parallel
3162000	3163000	experiments.
3164000	3165000	These are
3165000	3166000	potential
3166000	3167000	and important
3168000	3169000	adaptive mutations.
3170000	3171000	This also
3172000	3173000	provides
3173000	3174000	a target
3175000	3176000	for verification
3177000	3178000	in the next experiment.
3179000	3180000	For example,
3180000	3181000	we can make a point map
3181000	3182000	to map these nucleotides
3183000	3184000	to see if they are
3184000	3185000	really increasing
3186000	3187000	in our
3188000	3189000	experimental conditions.
3202000	3203000	In short,
3204000	3205000	we tested
3206000	3207000	many different
3208000	3209000	genetic backgrounds
3210000	3211000	and different
3212000	3213000	population bottleneck sizes.
3214000	3215000	We tried to
3216000	3217000	understand
3218000	3219000	whether the different
3220000	3221000	phenotypes
3222000	3223000	in different
3224000	3225000	genetic backgrounds
3226000	3227000	or in different
3227000	3228000	stronger bottlenecks
3229000	3230000	can also show
3230000	3231000	parallelism.
3231000	3232000	Will the level of
3232000	3233000	parallelism change?
3234000	3235000	The results show
3236000	3237000	that
3241000	3242000	although the
3242000	3243000	level of
3244000	3245000	parallelism
3245000	3246000	is lower than the
3246000	3247000	genetic background,
3248000	3249000	the rate of
3250000	3251000	mutation
3252000	3253000	is lower
3254000	3255000	than the genetic background.
3256000	3257000	This may be because
3258000	3259000	most mutations
3260000	3261000	are not good
3261000	3262000	for the individual.
3262000	3263000	If the
3263000	3264000	mutation rate is
3264000	3265000	high,
3265000	3266000	the
3267000	3268000	mutation rate
3269000	3270000	will be
3270000	3271000	affected
3271000	3272000	negatively
3272000	3273000	by the
3273000	3274000	genetic background.
3274000	3275000	Maybe
3275000	3276000	the
3276000	3277000	effect of
3277000	3278000	the
3278000	3279000	genetic background
3279000	3280000	will make
3280000	3281000	the
3281000	3282000	mutation rate
3282000	3283000	lower.
3283000	3284000	We also found that
3284000	3285000	the MR-
3285000	3286000	line
3286000	3287000	tends to
3287000	3288000	evolve
3288000	3289000	population
3289000	3290000	substructure.
3290000	3291000	This
3291000	3292000	part of the
3292000	3293000	hypothesis
3293000	3294000	may be because
3294000	3295000	the evolution
3295000	3296000	of population
3296000	3297000	substructure
3297000	3298000	may
3298000	3299000	require
3299000	3300000	different
3300000	3301000	types of
3301000	3302000	mutations
3302000	3303000	to
3303000	3304000	cause
3304000	3305000	different
3305000	3306000	mutations
3306000	3307000	in the
3307000	3308000	population.
3308000	3309000	Different
3309000	3310000	mutations
3310000	3311000	in different
3311000	3312000	places
3312000	3313000	may have
3313000	3314000	different
3314000	3315000	collaborations.
3315000	3316000	For example,
3316000	3317000	in
3317000	3318000	biofilm,
3318000	3319000	some
3319000	3320000	individuals
3320000	3321000	may secrete
3321000	3322000	nutrients
3322000	3323000	that
3323000	3324000	may be
3324000	3325000	needed
3325000	3326000	by other
3326000	3327000	individuals.
3327000	3328000	If the
3328000	3329000	total mutation
3329000	3330000	rate is
3330000	3331000	higher,
3331000	3332000	different
3332000	3333000	individuals
3333000	3334000	may
3334000	3335000	have
3335000	3336000	this
3336000	3337000	collaboration
3337000	3338000	related
3338000	3339000	mutation.
3339000	3340000	However,
3340000	3341000	although
3341000	3342000	the
3342000	3343000	MR-
3343000	3344000	mutation
3344000	3345000	rate
3345000	3346000	is higher,
3346000	3347000	it
3347000	3348000	does not
3348000	3349000	cause
3349000	3350000	the
3350000	3351000	population
3351000	3352000	fitness
3352000	3353000	difference.
3353000	3354000	A
3354000	3355000	stronger
3355000	3356000	bottleneck
3356000	3357000	size
3357000	3358000	will
3358000	3359000	reduce
3359000	3360000	the
3360000	3361000	fitness
3361000	3362000	evolve
3362000	3363000	rate
3363000	3364000	and
3364000	3365000	the
3365000	3366000	genome
3366000	3367000	evolve
3367000	3368000	rate.
3368000	3369000	In
3369000	3370000	addition,
3370000	3371000	we can
3371000	3372000	also see
3372000	3373000	the
3373000	3374000	genotypic
3374000	3375000	parallelism
3375000	3376000	above.
3376000	3377000	Whether
3377000	3378000	it is
3378000	3379000	gene level
3379000	3380000	or
3380000	3381000	single
3381000	3382000	nucleotide
3382000	3383000	level,
3383000	3384000	these
3384000	3385000	provide
3385000	3386000	us
3386000	3387000	with
3387000	3388000	experiments
3388000	3389000	to
3389000	3390000	see
3390000	3391000	whether
3391000	3392000	these
3392000	3393000	genes
3393000	3394000	or
3394000	3395000	these
3395000	3396000	mutations
3396000	3397000	can
3397000	3398000	make

3411000	3412000	In
3412000	3413000	this
3413000	3414000	experiment,
3414000	3415000	we
3415000	3416000	are
3416000	3417000	testing
3417000	3418000	different
3418000	3419000	mutating

3420000	3421000	and
3421000	3422000	related
3422000	3423000	factors.
3423000	3424000	In
3424000	3425000	fact,
3425000	3426000	there are
3426000	3427000	many
3427000	3428000	different
3428000	3429000	replay
3429000	3430000	life
3430000	3431000	tape
3431000	3432000	experiments.
3432000	3433000	Panel
3433000	3434000	A is
3434000	3435000	the most
3435000	3436000	basic
3436000	3437000	experiment
3437000	3438000	with
3438000	3439000	many
3439000	3440000	parallel
3440000	3441000	genes.
3441000	3442000	But
3442000	3443000	there are
3443000	3444000	also
3444000	3445000	other
3445000	3446000	proposals.
3446000	3447000	For example,
3447000	3448000	in the
3448000	3449000	process of
3449000	3450000	evolution,
3450000	3451000	you
3451000	3452000	take
3452000	3453000	different
3453000	3454000	evolution
3454000	3455000	results
3455000	3456000	from
3456000	3457000	different
3457000	3458000	times
3458000	3459000	and
3459000	3460000	see
3460000	3461000	if
3461000	3462000	each
3462000	3463000	evolution
3463000	3464000	point
3464000	3465000	has an
3465000	3466000	effect
3466000	3467000	on
3467000	3468000	each
3468000	3469000	evolution
3469000	3470000	process.
3470000	3471000	You
3471000	3472000	move it
3472000	3473000	to another
3473000	3474000	environment
3474000	3475000	and
3475000	3476000	see if
3476000	3477000	the
3477000	3478000	first
3478000	3479000	evolution
3479000	3480000	has
3480000	3481000	an
3481000	3482000	effect
3482000	3483000	on
3483000	3484000	the
3484000	3485000	second
3485000	3486000	evolution.
3486000	3487000	In
3487000	3488000	addition,
3488000	3489000	there are
3489000	3490000	more
3490000	3491000	professional
3491000	3492000	evolutions
3492000	3493000	trying to
3493000	3494000	bring the
3494000	3495000	environment
3495000	3496000	closer to
3496000	3497000	the
3497000	3498000	real
3498000	3499000	world.
3499000	3500000	For
3500000	3501000	example,
3501000	3502000	there is
3502000	3503000	a
3503000	3504000	lot of
3504000	3505000	time
3505000	3506000	to
3506000	3507000	add
3507000	3508000	interactions
3508000	3509000	between
3509000	3510000	different
3510000	3511000	species.
3511000	3512000	For
3512000	3513000	example,
3513000	3514000	some
3514000	3515000	put
3515000	3516000	the
3516000	3517000	sperm
3517000	3518000	and
3518000	3519000	algae
3519000	3520000	together
3520000	3521000	to
3521000	3522000	co-evolve.
3522000	3523000	There
3523000	3524000	is also
3524000	3525000	a
3525000	3526000	more
3526000	3527000	popular
3527000	3528000	way
3528000	3529000	to
3529000	3530000	make
3530000	3531000	the
3531000	3532000	environment
3532000	3533000	closer
3533000	3534000	to the
3534000	3535000	real
3535000	3536000	world.
3536000	3537000	At
3537000	3538000	the same
3538000	3539000	time,
3539000	3540000	we as
3540000	3541000	evolution
3541000	3542000	biologists
3542000	3543000	want to
3543000	3544000	improve the
3544000	3545000	predictability
3545000	3546000	of evolution
3546000	3547000	models,
3547000	3548000	but
3548000	3549000	the
3549000	3550000	analysis I
3550000	3551000	did
3551000	3552000	was
3552000	3553000	very
3553000	3554000	linear.
3554000	3555000	We
3555000	3556000	saw
3556000	3557000	evolutionary
3557000	3558000	outcomes,
3558000	3559000	and we
3559000	3560000	used
3560000	3561000	regression
3561000	3562000	or statistical
3562000	3563000	methods
3563000	3564000	to see
3564000	3565000	whether
3565000	3566000	these
3566000	3567000	factors
3567000	3568000	have
3568000	3569000	prediction
3569000	3570000	power.
3570000	3571000	This
3571000	3572000	is my
3572000	3573000	top-down
3573000	3574000	approach.
3574000	3575000	I see
3575000	3576000	outcomes,
3576000	3577000	and I
3577000	3578000	want to
3578000	3579000	correlate
3579000	3580000	them
3580000	3581000	with
3581000	3582000	different
3582000	3583000	factors.
3583000	3584000	I
3584000	3585000	think
3585000	3586000	this
3586000	3587000	is
3587000	3588000	my
3588000	3589000	bottom-up
3589000	3590000	approach.
3590000	3591000	For
3591000	3592000	example,
3592000	3593000	I
3593000	3594000	start
3594000	3595000	with
3595000	3596000	biophysical
3596000	3597000	or
3597000	3598000	biochemical
3598000	3599000	properties,
3599000	3600000	and if
3600000	3601000	I know
3601000	3602000	how
3602000	3603000	each
3603000	3604000	mutation
3604000	3605000	affects
3605000	3606000	fitness,
