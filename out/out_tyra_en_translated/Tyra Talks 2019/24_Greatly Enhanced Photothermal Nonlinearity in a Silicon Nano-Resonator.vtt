00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm your host, Emma Lin.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm currently working on CO2 reduction in Caltech.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Welcome to our talk today.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
First, I'd like to introduce our speaker for today, Du Yixiu.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Du Yixiu is a doctoral student at Stanford University.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
She graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Physics.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
During her time at the university,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
she worked as a postdoctoral student at the Zhu Shiwei Laboratory.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
She did research on silicon photonics.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
During her time at the university,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
she went to Berkeley Department of Physics for a year.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
At the time, she did research on graphene synthesis.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Yixiu is currently in the Department of Physics at Stanford.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
She did her Ph.D. in physics for a year.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
She is currently doing her Ph.D. rotation in Professor Gao Sunhong's lab.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
The lab she is currently working on is

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
sound imaging and neuroscience-related research.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Her next interest in the doctoral program

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
is to combine nanophotonics and neuroscience

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
to do applications.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
The topic of her presentation today is

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
the research she did with Professor Zhu Shiwei at the university.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
The topic of this presentation is

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
about the rapid development of silicon memory circuits.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
People have always wanted to combine silicon

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
and nanoparticles in a chip

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
to achieve a real photonical IC.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
However, silicon components are relatively large,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
so they want to understand

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
whether they can reduce the magnitude to nanometers

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
to achieve greater density

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
while maintaining the nature of nonlinear light.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
The topic of this presentation is

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
the great enhanced photothermal nonlinearity

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
in a silicon nanoresonator.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Let's give a round of applause

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
to welcome our speaker today, Du Yixiu.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Thank you for having me.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm Du Yixiu.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
so if you have any questions,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
please feel free to ask.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm Du Yixiu.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
so if you have any questions,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
please feel free to ask.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm Du Yixiu.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
so if you have any questions,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
please feel free to ask.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm Du Yixiu.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I'm Du Yixiu.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
so if you have any questions,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
please feel free to ask.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I'm Du Yixiu.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't think there are a lot of people here,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
so if you have any questions,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
please feel free to ask.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm Du Yixiu.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Nowadays,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
there are some people writing their article

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
in 2010 called

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
''The Logical Next Step of an Optical Transistor''.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Now this person publishes his article in 2010 called

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
''The Logical Next Step of an Optical Transistor''.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
The article talks about

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
two important points

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
for nano photonics devices.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We want great density

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
to match the electrical IC.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
We also want a good enough functionality.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
This functionality is like

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
an electrolyte.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
We want a good enough electron-electron interaction.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Through this electron-electron interaction,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
we can control the device.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Can optical do the same?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Let's take a look.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Recently, there is a very popular field

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
called Silicon Photonics.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
You can see the timeline.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
In 2003,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
it was Silicon Nanophotonics' birthday.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
That day, everyone thought about

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
how to combine

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
nanoscale silicon waveguide

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
and micronscale optical fiber

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
through a technique called

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
tapping.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Then we can extend

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
the optical fiber technology

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
to silicon waveguide technology.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I want to emphasize that

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
in the past 10 years,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Silicon Photonics' field

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
has developed rapidly.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Looking back to modern science,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
it is hard to see such a rapid development

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
in 10 years.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Silicon Photonics is

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
a very popular field.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Next,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I want to talk about

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
why everyone wants to

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
use silicon

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
to realize electronics.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
First,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
we know that there is a lot of silicon in nature,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
so it is very natural abundance.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
On the other hand,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
silicon has very mature fabrication technology,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
so we can make very small devices,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
but we can also make a lot of devices.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
For various reasons,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
electronics has developed rapidly,

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
so people want to

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
expand it to the photonics platform.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
The reason is that

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
if we expand to the photonics platform,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
we may have

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
very high speed potential.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
We can potentially reach

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
a very high speed switch.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I want to show you

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
the technology that combines

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
photonics and electronics.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Everything in the same platform.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
This is an article published in Nature

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
in 2018.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
The left half of the article

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
is the electronics device, transistor.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
On the same chip,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
we can see the photonics device.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
If we take a closer look,

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
we can see that

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
the electronics device

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
and the photonics device

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
are all on the same chip.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
If you look closely at this scale bar,

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
there are countless electrical devices

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
on the same chip.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We can make very good

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
electrical-based integrated circuits.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
But in the case of the photonics device,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
we only have one.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Its scale bar is 10 microns,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
like this microresonator.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
You may ask,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
why don't we make it smaller?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Why do we have so many electronic devices?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
The reason is that

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
we want to reduce the footprint

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
from 10 microns to 100 nanometers.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
That's what people think.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
But if we want to reduce the footprint,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
we have to consider other problems.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
For example,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
if we reduce the footprint,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
we will have the same functionality

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
as a large size.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
One aspect of the functionality

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
is optical nonlinearity.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
The optical nonlinearity of silicon

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
is very small.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
The definition of nonlinearity is

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
if I increase the intensity of my illumination,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
my refractive index

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
will also increase.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
This coefficient represents

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
the nature of the nonlinearity of the material itself.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Because our silicon

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
is a very small nonlinearity,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
can we increase its intensity?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, people think like Lipson.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
In Columbia,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Lipson thought about

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
whether to use a resonance structure

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
to make the resonance bigger.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
For example,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
the structure of the microresonator,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
the SEM2,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
can reach a very sharp spectrum

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
and symbolize a very high quality factor.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
With such a resonance structure,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
we can increase the functionality of our devices.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
However,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
we want to make a very small device.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Is there a way

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
to make such a small device?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Although the quality factor is very low,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
can we use other ways

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
to reduce the quality factor?

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Can we find other nonlinearity mechanisms

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
to make our functionality

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
maintain the same?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
This is the most classic example

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
of a resonator in a microresonator.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
The so-called mixed resonator

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
provides a resonance

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
at a very small magnitude.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
If we look at this SEM2,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
it has different resonance

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
colors,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
such as blue,

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
green, and red.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
This microresonator is size-dependent.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
There is a lot of research

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
on this matter,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
especially in the past 10 years.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The so-called high-index material

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
has a very special resonance phenomenon.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
It was published in 2017.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
It is Yusuke Nagasaki,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
my collaborator.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
He did the research.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
It is a silicon-on-top-of-quartz structure.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
This structure can fine-tune

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
the width of each silicon nanoparticle,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
such as Wx and Wy.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
With different combinations of widths,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
we can get a rainbow-like structure.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
This rainbow-like structure

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
tells us that

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
we have a very good ability

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
to fine-tune the resonance.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Our future research

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
will use a similar sample.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
The next thing I want to talk about

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
is that since our nanostructure

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
has such a weak resonance,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
is there any way

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
to increase it with other mechanisms?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
We all know that

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
photothermal is a solution.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Is there any other mechanism

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
to maintain its nonlinearity?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
The answer is that

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
we can combine photothermal

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
and nonlinear resonance.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
As you know,

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
the photothermal effect

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
is a very large nonlinear effect.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
In a small-scale nanoparticle,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
it is a very efficient optical heater.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
In this paper in 2017,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
he sprinkled silicon

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
on the surface of SiO2

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
to show that

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
in a specific dimension,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
the silicon nanoparticle

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
has a very strong optical heating effect.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
We can heat this silicon nanoparticle

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
to about 600K.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Because of these two reasons,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
it is a very efficient optical heater.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
So maybe we can

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
use it to combine

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
nano-resonance to achieve

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
a greater nonlinear effect.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
So our work combines two things.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
The first thing is a very weak

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
nano-resonance,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
but it is a very small nanostructure.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
The other part is

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
the photothermal effect.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
The photothermal effect provides

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
a very large nonlinear effect.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
If we combine these two things,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
we can get a greater nonlinear effect.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
If we compare

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
these two things,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
we can get a very small nanostructure

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
and a very good photothermal effect.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
If we compare

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
the photothermal effect,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
we can see that

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
in ordinary materials,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
the nonlinear coefficient is about

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
10 to the power of 9.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
After the enhanced nonlinearity

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
of the photosynthesis,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
we can increase the nonlinear coefficient

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
by 3 orders.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
This is the process we are going to discuss.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
This is our system.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
We want to achieve

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
resonance.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
We need to characterize

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
the resonance.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
So we use a dark field system.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
This dark field system

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
allows us to get a spectrum

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
This is a confocal system.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
The light follows the orange light.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
It hits the object

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
and passes through the gobbled mirror

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
to select the particle you want.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Finally, it enters the spectrum meter.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
On the other hand,

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
we want to stimulate the photothermal effect.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
So we use a 5.6E laser.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
It passes through the gobbled mirror

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
to control where we want to hit the particle.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
It illuminates the silicon nanostructure.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
We also use a dark field system

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
to get a background-free,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
clean image.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
This is the resonance we get.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
We can see that by controlling

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
different nanostructures,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
such as Wx and Wy,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
we can get a very colorful image.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
This colorful image tells us

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
that the resonance of each particle

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
is completely different.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
So we can expect

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
a different photothermal effect.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
If we look at this line,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
we can use a 5.6E laser

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
to do photothermal illumination.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Under this illumination,

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
we can see that

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
there are three peaks

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
of scattering intensity

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
at three different degrees.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
This result is quite similar

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
to the simulation.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
So we can say that

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
in the silicon nanostructure

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
at 100 nm,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
there is a magnetic dipole,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
an electric dipole,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
and a magnetic quadrupole.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Why do we choose a 5.6E wavelength?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Because with a 5.6E wavelength,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
we can see different resonance peaks

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
at the same time.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Different resonance peaks

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
affect the nonlinear behavior.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
With the same 5.6E wavelength,

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
we can trigger

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
two different absorption peaks.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
This is why we choose a 5.6E wavelength.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
I have been talking about

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
nonlinear effects.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
In fact, what we want to discuss

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
is that if we increase

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
the excitation intensity,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
what will happen to

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
the optical properties?

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
If it is a linear case,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
if we increase the excitation intensity,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
the scattering intensity

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
will also grow linearly.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
However, if it is a nonlinear case,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
the scattering intensity

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
will saturate.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Since we want to control

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
the intensity of the light,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
we need to adjust the power.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
We can adjust it like this.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Or we can

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
make good use of

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
our scanning system.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
We can move the beam like this.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
By moving it like this,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
we can also

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
saturate the nanostructure

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
at different intensities.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
In this case,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
we can see that in a linear case,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
there will be a linear scattering growth.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
In a nonlinear case,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
there is a hole in the middle of our image.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
It has a dominance shape.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
This dominance shape tells us that

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
at the center point,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
where the intensity of the light is the highest,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
we have a relatively small

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
scattering behavior.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
This is a very strange phenomenon.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
If we want to quantify this phenomenon,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
this is the result of

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
one of the size 190 nm nanoparticles.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
When we increase the excitation intensity,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
the scattering intensity will

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
have a saturation phenomenon.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
We will see the point spread function

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
of this dominance shape.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Similarly,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
for example,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
we will also see

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
a saturation phenomenon.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
In 170 nm nanoparticles,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
we can't find particles at low intensities.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
But when we increase the

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
excitation intensity,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
the particles will suddenly come out.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
The scattering will suddenly increase a lot.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
One thing to note is that

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
this phenomenon is reversible.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
We can restore it.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
It is not related to the damage

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
caused by the light.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
To summarize,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
different nanoparticles

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
have different scattering deviations.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Scattering deviations like

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
100 nm nanoparticles

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
will have a decrease in intensity.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
In 170 nm nanoparticles,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
the intensity will increase a lot.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
This phenomenon is not only

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
a nonlinear phenomenon

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
on this diagonal axis.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
In fact,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
in different combinations of

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Wx and Wy,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
we can observe

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
this very large nonlinear effect.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Why do I say it's very large?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Because in the

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
nonlinear effect of

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
normal silicon itself,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
we will only produce

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
about 10 to the power of 9 percent optical modulation.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
But in this case,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
we will only produce

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
about 500 percent

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
or minus 70 percent

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
nonlinear modulation.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
In addition,

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I want to talk about another thing.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
We just saw a summary.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
The nonlinear behavior of

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
different nanoparticles is different.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
What is the relationship between them?

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
We can see that

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
in the negative nonlinearity,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
like this saturation,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
the spectrum on the resonance

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
is a peak.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
On the other hand,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
this 170 nm nanoparticle

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
looks like a dip on the resonance spectrum.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
But we won't catch all the peaks.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
For example,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
this 130 nm nanoparticle

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
is a scattering peak,

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
but we can't observe the nonlinear behavior.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Why is that?

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
We will explain further

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
with the photo thermal effect we just mentioned.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
First of all,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
the photo thermal effect

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
does exist in our system.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
We have experimental evidence

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
and simulated evidence.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
In the experimental evidence,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
we can use the Raman microscope

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
to observe how many degrees

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
the silicon nanoparticle has risen.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
Our answer is about a few hundred degrees.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
This is quite consistent with the literature.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
In the simulation,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
we can see that

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
the silicon nanostructure

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
only has a very strong temperature increase

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
in a specific geometry.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
This is the photo thermal effect we observed.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
If we heat up a silicon nanoparticle,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
the photo thermal effect

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
produces heat.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
This heat

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
increases the refractive index.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
This increase in the refractive index

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
leads to the change in the mean resonance.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
This increase in the refractive index

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
leads to the change in the mean resonance.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
This leads to the nonlinear effect we mentioned.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
We simulated

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
this blue curve.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
Our scattering

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
is the blue curve

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
for different size distributions.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
When we increase the radius,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
we get the red curve.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
Because different particles

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
have different refractive indexes,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
the cross-section of the scattering is different.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
If we combine these two lines,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
we get the black curve.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
This black curve

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
is very consistent with the experiment.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
This black curve is very consistent with the experiment.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
This black curve is very consistent with the experiment.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
This explains the effect of our observation

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
of the photo thermal effect.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
In addition,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
In addition,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
we simulated these three

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
170 and 190 neoparticles

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
as a single nonlinear curve.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
as a single nonlinear curve.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
This is very consistent with the experiment.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
This further proves that

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
the photo thermal effect

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
is the nonlinearity mechanism.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
is the nonlinearity mechanism.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
If you hear the word photo thermal effect,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
many people may think

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
that if the device is controlled by thermal energy,

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
it may be very slow.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
But in fact,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
the photo thermal effect is not necessarily slow.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
In terms of magnitude, it is very slow.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
But in terms of magnitude,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
our experiment and simulation

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
have shown that

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
the photo thermal effect observed

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
on the silicon nanostructure

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
is very fast.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
At this point,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
if we turn on the 785nm laser,

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
there will be a large drop in the velocity.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
there will be a large drop in the velocity.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
This time scale is about 2ns.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
This simulation also tells us the same thing.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
This simulation also tells us the same thing.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
If we look at this picture,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
we can get a very fast thermal response

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
of 1GHz.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
of 1GHz.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
It tells us that it is a minus 50% nonlinear effect.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
It tells us that it is a minus 50% nonlinear effect.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
So we can make a device

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
with a 50% deviation.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
with a 50% deviation.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
But it still maintains a very fast speed of 1GHz.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
But it still maintains a very fast speed of 1GHz.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Another interesting observation is

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
that when we

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
When we

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
When we

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
can we go back to the screen?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Can we go back to the screen?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
What is the input image?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
What is the input image?

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
What is the input image?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
What is the input image?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
The x-axis of the laser...

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
The insert...

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
The insert...

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
The insert...

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
You choose a peak and not a z-axis,

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
You choose a peak and not a z-axis,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
because the laser...

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
you can choose any size to reach the peak

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Our sample is placed at room temperature

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
but the Photo Thermal Effect is a local thermal effect

29:06.000 --> 29:11.280
So the sensitization of the very small thickness

29:11.280 --> 29:16.280
but the surrounding area is maintained

29:20.280 --> 29:23.280
Thank you for the question

29:23.280 --> 29:27.280
Another interesting phenomenon is

29:27.280 --> 29:30.280
if it is a Photo Thermal Effect

29:30.280 --> 29:39.280
then we change the surrounding thermal diffusion

29:39.280 --> 29:46.280
For example, if the thermal diffusion is changed

29:46.280 --> 29:49.280
then we should see a different phenomenon

29:49.280 --> 29:52.280
The result is that our Point Spreading Function

29:52.280 --> 29:55.280
has a very sharp transition

29:55.280 --> 29:58.280
This is our profile

29:58.280 --> 30:01.280
When we enter high laser intensity

30:01.280 --> 30:04.280
we will have a very strange triangular change

30:04.280 --> 30:09.280
This triangular change tells us a very shaky phenomenon

30:09.280 --> 30:13.280
But we don't know how to explain it yet

30:13.280 --> 30:17.280
Let me make a conclusion

30:17.280 --> 30:23.280
We observed a very large Photo Thermal Nonlinearity

30:23.280 --> 30:28.280
We combined two things to achieve this result

30:28.280 --> 30:33.280
The first thing is that we want to reduce the size

30:33.280 --> 30:38.280
So we will use the material of Mean Resonance

30:38.280 --> 30:41.280
We use the material of nanometer

30:41.280 --> 30:45.280
Usually we think of Mean Resonance

30:45.280 --> 30:48.280
Although the quality factor is very low

30:48.280 --> 30:53.280
but we have other ways to solve this problem

30:53.280 --> 30:57.280
So we meet the size requirement

30:57.280 --> 31:01.280
How to meet the functionality requirement?

31:01.280 --> 31:06.280
We use a very powerful natural

31:06.280 --> 31:14.280
change of Photo Thermal Nonlinearity

31:14.280 --> 31:17.280
Combining these two things

31:17.280 --> 31:21.280
we can create a Photo Thermal Effect

31:21.280 --> 31:24.280
larger than the original Bulk

31:24.280 --> 31:29.280
Because of the Enhanced Mean Resonance

31:29.280 --> 31:34.280
So we can get a very large Nonlinearity Effect

31:34.280 --> 31:37.280
Like this picture

31:37.280 --> 31:40.280
When we increase Excitation Intensity

31:40.280 --> 31:42.280
Scattering Intensity saturates

31:42.280 --> 31:46.280
and even creates a donut shape

31:46.280 --> 31:48.280
Another thing is that

31:48.280 --> 31:50.280
this Photo Thermal Effect

31:50.280 --> 31:55.280
is not necessarily as slow as the large scale

31:55.280 --> 31:57.280
In fact, in a small scale

31:57.280 --> 32:06.280
we have proven the recovery speed of a nanosecond

32:06.280 --> 32:10.280
This allows us to make a 1GHz

32:10.280 --> 32:15.280
about 50% deviation device

32:15.280 --> 32:19.280
So I want to thank you for listening

32:19.280 --> 32:22.280
and thank you to my advisor

32:23.280 --> 32:25.280
at Taiwan University of Physics

32:25.280 --> 32:29.280
And I want to thank my co-authors

32:29.280 --> 32:31.280
like Yusuke Nagasaki

32:31.280 --> 32:34.280
He is at Osaka University

32:34.280 --> 32:37.280
I was lucky enough to go to Osaka University

32:37.280 --> 32:40.280
for a while

32:40.280 --> 32:42.280
and got to know them

32:42.280 --> 32:44.280
They gave me great help

32:44.280 --> 32:48.280
Finally, they helped us with

32:49.280 --> 32:52.280
fabrication

32:52.280 --> 32:55.280
So thank you for listening

32:55.280 --> 32:58.280
I am happy to take any questions

32:58.280 --> 32:59.280
Thank you

33:08.280 --> 33:13.280
Thank you Yusuke

33:13.280 --> 33:18.280
Any questions?

33:37.280 --> 33:40.280
The first question is

33:40.280 --> 33:43.280
I want to know how fabrication is done

33:43.280 --> 33:51.280
Where does silicon-on-quartz come from?

33:51.280 --> 33:57.280
We bought the silicon-on-quartz structure from Company

33:57.280 --> 34:03.280
How does it work?

34:03.280 --> 34:07.280
It uses pure silicon

34:07.280 --> 34:12.280
to oxidize the bottom layer into SiO2

34:12.280 --> 34:17.280
The top layer is cut off with ion beam

34:21.280 --> 34:26.280
Wait, you said you bought the SOI structure?

34:26.280 --> 34:28.280
Yes

34:28.280 --> 34:33.280
Usually the SOI structure is made of silicon

34:33.280 --> 34:36.280
The silicon is thicker

34:36.280 --> 34:40.280
But the SOI structure is different

34:40.280 --> 34:45.280
It's made of quartz

34:45.280 --> 34:49.280
It's made of two layers

34:49.280 --> 34:51.280
So it's wafer-bonding?

34:51.280 --> 34:53.280
Yes

34:57.280 --> 35:00.280
Another question is

35:00.280 --> 35:05.280
I want to know how the donor shape is formed

35:19.280 --> 35:28.280
If we move the excitation beam from left to right

35:28.280 --> 35:32.280
Because the excitation beam is a Gaussian shape

35:32.280 --> 35:36.280
When we pass through the nanostructure

35:36.280 --> 35:40.280
The excitation of the nanostructure

35:40.280 --> 35:45.280
is from the small innumeration to the big innumeration

35:45.280 --> 35:48.280
When the big innumeration occurs

35:48.280 --> 35:53.280
The Gaussian beam hits the nanostructure

35:53.280 --> 35:58.280
So when we do confocal scanning

35:58.280 --> 36:03.280
We are also varying the power density

36:03.280 --> 36:06.280
So the image you show is not the real image

36:06.280 --> 36:09.280
It's a scanning image

36:09.280 --> 36:15.280
The raw data we get is like this

36:15.280 --> 36:18.280
So the image is scanned?

36:18.280 --> 36:20.280
Yes

36:24.280 --> 36:28.280
It's processed at the end

36:28.280 --> 36:32.280
The last question is

36:32.280 --> 36:36.280
This kind of mini-resonator

36:36.280 --> 36:38.280
It has a large load

36:38.280 --> 36:42.280
And it's not easy to couple

36:42.280 --> 36:47.280
My understanding is that it's hard to couple to nanofortanites

36:47.280 --> 36:51.280
Is there any way to solve this problem?

36:51.280 --> 36:55.280
This is a great question

36:55.280 --> 36:58.280
For coupling

36:58.280 --> 37:01.280
Because the mainstream of nanofortanites

37:01.280 --> 37:04.280
Is to use the silicon waveguide

37:04.280 --> 37:10.280
So it's hard to couple to the silicon waveguide

37:10.280 --> 37:12.280
That's right

37:12.280 --> 37:17.280
But we don't necessarily

37:18.280 --> 37:24.280
It can be made like a gate

37:24.280 --> 37:26.280
Like this

37:26.280 --> 37:29.280
This is a potential application

37:29.280 --> 37:32.280
We have a silicon waveguide

37:32.280 --> 37:37.280
We put a mini-resonator on it

37:37.280 --> 37:42.280
If the intensity of my silicon waveguide is very strong

37:42.280 --> 37:46.280
Or we put a high beam on the right

37:46.280 --> 37:49.280
To heat the silicon nanofortanite

37:49.280 --> 37:53.280
We use another kind of wavelength

37:53.280 --> 37:56.280
To communicate

37:56.280 --> 37:59.280
Although the load of the mini-resonator is large

37:59.280 --> 38:05.280
But its load will not affect the communication wavelength

38:05.280 --> 38:11.280
Why not?

38:11.280 --> 38:16.280
Because it's a bit like a pump probe

38:16.280 --> 38:21.280
We use an irrelevant wavelength to pump it

38:21.280 --> 38:26.280
Its purpose is to increase the temperature

38:26.280 --> 38:31.280
Of course, the on-off ratio can be done very well

38:31.280 --> 38:36.280
But your signal will always have a loss

38:36.280 --> 38:41.280
No matter if you have a gate

38:41.280 --> 38:46.280
The loss of your waveguide will always be large

38:46.280 --> 38:48.280
It should be like this

38:48.280 --> 38:51.280
Yes, because it's more of a scatter

38:51.280 --> 38:55.280
But I think we can use engineering

38:55.280 --> 38:59.280
To make the loss smaller through different wavelengths

39:00.280 --> 39:04.280
Like this picture

39:08.280 --> 39:11.280
If we look at the absorption on the right

39:11.280 --> 39:14.280
It's about 800 nm or more

39:14.280 --> 39:18.280
The silicon itself has no absorption

39:18.280 --> 39:23.280
So through different wavelengths

39:23.280 --> 39:28.280
With different geometry of the mini-resonator

39:28.280 --> 39:33.280
We can adjust the absorption

39:33.280 --> 39:36.280
To make the loss as small as possible

39:41.280 --> 39:46.280
Is the main current of silicon waveguide 1.5μm?

39:46.280 --> 39:51.280
Why do you want to do it in the visible range?

39:51.280 --> 39:54.280
Because in the visible range

39:54.280 --> 39:57.280
We have enough absorption

39:57.280 --> 40:02.280
If it's 1.5μm, we don't have enough absorption

40:04.280 --> 40:11.280
Does this become a point to pay attention to in the future?

40:11.280 --> 40:17.280
Because most waveguides should be at 1.5μm or 1.1μm

40:17.280 --> 40:22.280
Yes, so the communication we want to send

40:22.280 --> 40:26.280
Should still be in the range of 1.5μm

40:26.280 --> 40:29.280
But what we emphasize here is

40:29.280 --> 40:34.280
Our nanometer structure can produce enough heat

40:34.280 --> 40:39.280
This heat can be enough to change the refractive index

40:39.280 --> 40:44.280
You mean you still have to use visible to pump

40:44.280 --> 40:49.280
Then you use 1.5 to probe

40:49.280 --> 40:54.280
This is the application in my mind

40:55.280 --> 41:01.280
So the potential structure we saw just now

41:01.280 --> 41:04.280
It hasn't been done yet

41:04.280 --> 41:08.280
It hasn't been done yet

41:08.280 --> 41:11.280
Will ThermoLight affect your 1.5?

41:11.280 --> 41:17.280
Will the evidence of this not being tested be affected?

41:17.280 --> 41:20.280
No, this will be the next project

41:24.280 --> 41:29.280
Hello

41:29.280 --> 41:36.280
Will the refractive index be affected by visible light?

41:36.280 --> 41:41.280
If you choose, like you just said, there are about 5 or 6 waves

41:41.280 --> 41:44.280
If you choose differently, maybe

41:44.280 --> 41:48.280
I think it's about the same

41:48.280 --> 41:50.280
I didn't hear it clearly

41:50.280 --> 41:53.280
No, because the picture you just showed

41:53.280 --> 41:55.280
There are about 4 or 5 peaks

41:55.280 --> 42:00.280
I just asked you why you used the 750-pixel picture

42:00.280 --> 42:02.280
Oh, yeah

42:02.280 --> 42:04.280
But the other lasers

42:04.280 --> 42:09.280
The other wavelength lasers feel more difficult to obtain

42:09.280 --> 42:11.280
A little bit, yeah

42:11.280 --> 42:13.280
Yeah

42:14.280 --> 42:18.280
It's okay, 400

42:18.280 --> 42:21.280
A little more than 400, so there's a chance

42:21.280 --> 42:25.280
This is done in the collaborator lab

42:25.280 --> 42:30.280
Their equipment is only 785

42:35.280 --> 42:39.280
But I think in terms of quantity

42:39.280 --> 42:43.280
I don't think Timescale will guess a lot

42:57.280 --> 42:59.280
Hello

43:10.280 --> 43:14.280
Any other questions?

43:19.280 --> 43:22.280
I have a general question

43:22.280 --> 43:25.280
Because I'm not involved in this field

43:25.280 --> 43:27.280
I want to ask

43:27.280 --> 43:30.280
Basically in this field

43:30.280 --> 43:33.280
The current level of development is

43:33.280 --> 43:36.280
You just said you want to scale

43:36.280 --> 43:39.280
When you want to scale smaller and smaller

43:39.280 --> 43:42.280
You want to maintain the quality of the laser beam

43:42.280 --> 43:44.280
And reduce other costs

43:44.280 --> 43:46.280
In this field

43:46.280 --> 43:49.280
Are there already a lot of people doing it?

43:49.280 --> 43:51.280
Or are you the pioneers?

43:51.280 --> 43:53.280
And besides this direction

43:53.280 --> 43:56.280
What other directions do you think

43:56.280 --> 44:01.280
Have the potential to improve this problem?

44:02.280 --> 44:04.280
I think

44:04.280 --> 44:08.280
The interaction between light and light itself is very small

44:08.280 --> 44:12.280
So generally everyone will try to

44:12.280 --> 44:16.280
Make the resonance structure bigger

44:16.280 --> 44:20.280
Solve this problem through geometric methods

44:20.280 --> 44:24.280
The most famous example is

44:24.280 --> 44:29.280
Microlipson's microbeam resonator

44:29.280 --> 44:34.280
The structure shown in the beginning

44:36.280 --> 44:39.280
So I believe

44:39.280 --> 44:42.280
Photonic's mainstream is something like this

44:42.280 --> 44:46.280
But everyone is still trying

44:46.280 --> 44:50.280
So they haven't thought about how to make the device smaller

44:50.280 --> 44:52.280
Are they just proposing ideas

44:52.280 --> 44:55.280
Or have they already made some prototypes?

44:55.280 --> 44:58.280
Photonic has already made something

44:58.280 --> 45:03.280
Many companies are already selling this kind of device

45:04.280 --> 45:08.280
So what are they doing with the microbeam?

45:08.280 --> 45:10.280
Waveguide

45:10.280 --> 45:12.280
Waveguide control

45:15.280 --> 45:21.280
How do they use the microbeam to control?

45:22.280 --> 45:24.280
Usually

45:24.280 --> 45:26.280
If

45:26.280 --> 45:29.280
If I have a beam

45:29.280 --> 45:31.280
If I have an EM wave

45:31.280 --> 45:34.280
Passed through the waveguide

45:34.280 --> 45:38.280
If the frequency of my EM wave

45:38.280 --> 45:42.280
Just meets the resonance structure of the nanostructure

45:42.280 --> 45:47.280
Then it will be completely trapped in this structure

45:47.280 --> 45:49.280
Will not continue to propagate

45:49.280 --> 45:52.280
So it can play the role of off

45:53.280 --> 45:57.280
The biggest discovery of Microlipson

45:57.280 --> 46:02.280
Is that he put a

46:02.280 --> 46:05.280
Put a potential

46:05.280 --> 46:07.280
Electrical potential

46:07.280 --> 46:09.280
Put a gating

46:09.280 --> 46:13.280
This gating will cause the refractive index to change

46:14.280 --> 46:18.280
So it can choose which light to pass and which light not to pass

46:18.280 --> 46:21.280
I have seen a similar structure before

46:21.280 --> 46:24.280
But it seems to be like

46:24.280 --> 46:26.280
You just

46:26.280 --> 46:30.280
The light is from top to bottom

46:30.280 --> 46:32.280
But it seems to be

46:32.280 --> 46:34.280
A very similar structure

46:34.280 --> 46:36.280
It can go from top left to bottom right

46:36.280 --> 46:38.280
But it can't go from bottom right to top left

46:38.280 --> 46:40.280
But

46:40.280 --> 46:43.280
But I think this thing

46:43.280 --> 46:44.280
I didn't understand at that time

46:44.280 --> 46:46.280
I just looked at its abstract

46:46.280 --> 46:48.280
It can do this

46:52.280 --> 46:54.280
But I wanted to ask you

46:54.280 --> 46:57.280
Do you know how he did it?

46:57.280 --> 46:59.280
I don't know

46:59.280 --> 47:01.280
You can find the abstract

47:01.280 --> 47:04.280
I don't seem to be

47:04.280 --> 47:06.280
Glenn Davison

47:06.280 --> 47:09.280
A professor at Maryland

47:09.280 --> 47:11.280
They are also doing Microlipson

47:11.280 --> 47:15.280
So what you said is that it can only pass in one direction

47:15.280 --> 47:17.280
It can't pass in another direction

47:17.280 --> 47:19.280
Although it uses a pathway

47:19.280 --> 47:20.280
Yes

47:20.280 --> 47:22.280
So I thought it was amazing at that time

47:22.280 --> 47:26.280
But I didn't take a closer look at it

47:26.280 --> 47:28.280
Have to find it again

47:28.280 --> 47:34.280
So what is the biggest advantage of its circular disk type?

47:34.280 --> 47:38.280
Compared to your general straight line web guide

47:38.280 --> 47:42.280
Because it will have a resonance structure

47:42.280 --> 47:46.280
It will have a resonance structure

47:46.280 --> 47:48.280
Called Whisper Gallery

47:48.280 --> 47:50.280
So the energy is stronger

47:50.280 --> 47:52.280
The signal is stronger

47:54.280 --> 47:56.280
I remember you have a picture

47:56.280 --> 47:58.280
It will have about four

47:58.280 --> 48:00.280
Two peaks

48:00.280 --> 48:02.280
I remember in the front or the back

48:04.280 --> 48:05.280
This one

48:05.280 --> 48:06.280
Yes

48:06.280 --> 48:10.280
Their separation

48:10.280 --> 48:14.280
It probably has something to do with the radius of this ring

48:14.280 --> 48:16.280
Or the size

48:16.280 --> 48:18.280
Or the voltage

48:18.280 --> 48:20.280
Of course

48:20.280 --> 48:24.280
So how much is the Q of this one?

48:24.280 --> 48:28.280
This Q is probably 10

48:28.280 --> 48:30.280
5-quart scale

48:32.280 --> 48:34.280
5-quart scale is pretty good

48:34.280 --> 48:38.280
Microcality is also about 6-7 quarts

48:41.280 --> 48:43.280
But in Mi Resonance

48:43.280 --> 48:47.280
The quality factor is probably only 1000

48:47.280 --> 48:51.280
So there is a difference of 3 quarts

48:53.280 --> 48:57.280
So I can only use other mechanisms

48:57.280 --> 49:00.280
To achieve the same energy

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
Sorry

49:05.280 --> 49:08.280
Mi Resonator has 1000?

49:09.280 --> 49:10.280
Sorry

49:10.280 --> 49:13.280
About 10-100

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
Ok

49:14.280 --> 49:16.280
So the picture you just showed

49:16.280 --> 49:18.280
Is about 10-100

49:18.280 --> 49:19.280
Yes

49:19.280 --> 49:20.280
Scale

49:20.280 --> 49:21.280
Ok

49:27.280 --> 49:29.280
Thank you everyone for your passionate questions

49:29.280 --> 49:31.280
Anyone else has questions?

49:31.280 --> 49:33.280
No

49:38.280 --> 49:41.280
Du Yixiu

49:41.280 --> 49:43.280
You can

49:43.280 --> 49:46.280
If any of you

49:46.280 --> 49:48.280
Have other questions after the talk

49:48.280 --> 49:50.280
You can contact Du Yixiu

49:50.280 --> 49:52.280
Through his email

49:52.280 --> 49:55.280
And Yixiu you can leave your email in the chat

49:55.280 --> 49:57.280
If you want to ask

50:01.280 --> 50:04.280
Click on the chat on the right

50:09.280 --> 50:11.280
Can I type?

50:11.280 --> 50:13.280
You can

50:19.280 --> 50:21.280
Can you hear me?

50:21.280 --> 50:22.280
Yes

50:22.280 --> 50:24.280
I want to ask

50:24.280 --> 50:26.280
Thank you for your talk

50:26.280 --> 50:28.280
I want to ask

50:28.280 --> 50:30.280
You mentioned that

50:30.280 --> 50:32.280
It has a nonlinear effect

50:32.280 --> 50:34.280
So it changed the N2 part

50:35.280 --> 50:37.280
The current nonlinear effect

50:37.280 --> 50:39.280
Is what I want to compare

50:39.280 --> 50:41.280
Yes

50:41.280 --> 50:43.280
If you have a strong current nonlinear effect

50:43.280 --> 50:46.280
You should also have a strong 2-photon absorption

50:46.280 --> 50:48.280
In this device

50:48.280 --> 50:50.280
I want to say

50:50.280 --> 50:52.280
The question is

50:52.280 --> 50:54.280
If you have a strong 2-photon absorption

50:54.280 --> 50:57.280
You can directly use the 1.5 wavelength

50:57.280 --> 51:00.280
Or use a more transparent wavelength

51:00.280 --> 51:03.280
To achieve a strong nonlinear effect

51:03.280 --> 51:05.280
Nonlinear effect

51:05.280 --> 51:07.280
I don't know if you've tried it

51:07.280 --> 51:09.280
Some people do it like this

51:09.280 --> 51:11.280
But

51:11.280 --> 51:16.280
To trigger the 2-photon absorption

51:16.280 --> 51:19.280
We need a very strong intensity

51:19.280 --> 51:21.280
So they use a femtosecond laser

51:21.280 --> 51:23.280
I see

51:23.280 --> 51:25.280
So you guys

51:25.280 --> 51:27.280
I see

51:27.280 --> 51:29.280
So you guys

51:29.280 --> 51:31.280
Don't have a femtosecond laser

51:31.280 --> 51:33.280
Not that I don't have a problem

51:33.280 --> 51:36.280
We want to use the minimum intensity

51:36.280 --> 51:38.280
Minimum intensity

51:38.280 --> 51:41.280
To trigger the nonlinearity

51:41.280 --> 51:43.280
I see

51:43.280 --> 51:45.280
I can ask

51:45.280 --> 51:47.280
I'm not sure if you compare like this

51:47.280 --> 51:49.280
But I want to

51:49.280 --> 51:51.280
Understand a little bit more

51:51.280 --> 51:53.280
If you put your excitation

51:53.280 --> 51:55.280
These power density

51:55.280 --> 51:57.280
Then you normalize it

51:57.280 --> 51:59.280
Absorption cross action

51:59.280 --> 52:01.280
You probably

52:01.280 --> 52:03.280
How many photons do you need

52:03.280 --> 52:07.280
To start seeing these nonlinear effects

52:12.280 --> 52:14.280
Can you say it again

52:14.280 --> 52:16.280
Because your excitation

52:16.280 --> 52:18.280
Most of the light

52:18.280 --> 52:20.280
Doesn't really couple to

52:20.280 --> 52:22.280
Its resonant mode

52:22.280 --> 52:24.280
Because its gathering cross action is very small

52:24.280 --> 52:26.280
But if you put your

52:26.280 --> 52:28.280
Excitation power density

52:29.280 --> 52:31.280
To normalize its

52:31.280 --> 52:33.280
Absorption cross action

52:33.280 --> 52:35.280
Which means that you

52:35.280 --> 52:37.280
Really excite the structure of the photon

52:37.280 --> 52:39.280
How many photons do you need

52:39.280 --> 52:41.280
To be able to see

52:41.280 --> 52:43.280
Its nonlinear phenomenon

52:46.280 --> 52:48.280
Or

52:48.280 --> 52:50.280
Because you emphasize that it is very strong

52:50.280 --> 52:52.280
You may be able to see very small power

52:52.280 --> 52:54.280
Just

52:54.280 --> 52:56.280
See this nonlinear effect

52:56.280 --> 52:58.280
Do you have some

52:58.280 --> 53:00.280
More quantitative

53:00.280 --> 53:02.280
Comparison method

53:02.280 --> 53:04.280
How much power

53:04.280 --> 53:06.280
Or how many photons

53:06.280 --> 53:08.280
Do you need

53:08.280 --> 53:10.280
How much intensity

53:10.280 --> 53:12.280
If it is

53:18.280 --> 53:20.280
If it is

53:20.280 --> 53:22.280
5

53:22.280 --> 53:24.280
Megawatts per

53:24.280 --> 53:26.280
square meter

53:26.280 --> 53:28.280
Right

53:28.280 --> 53:30.280
General nonlinearity is

53:30.280 --> 53:32.280
10 to the power of 9

53:32.280 --> 53:34.280
I see

53:34.280 --> 53:36.280
In our case

53:36.280 --> 53:38.280
There will be a very large deviation

53:38.280 --> 53:40.280
I see

53:40.280 --> 53:42.280
So if you

53:42.280 --> 53:44.280
10 to the power of 9

53:44.280 --> 53:46.280
If there is such a phenomenon

53:46.280 --> 53:48.280
Then I almost have to

53:48.280 --> 53:50.280
5 times 10 to the power of 9

53:50.280 --> 53:52.280
To be able to use

53:52.280 --> 53:54.280
Absorption of two photons

53:54.280 --> 53:56.280
To achieve a similar effect

53:56.280 --> 53:58.280
I see

53:58.280 --> 54:00.280
I see OK

54:00.280 --> 54:02.280
Then I can probably

54:02.280 --> 54:04.280
Thank you for your answer

54:04.280 --> 54:06.280
Thank you

54:06.280 --> 54:08.280
Thank you

54:10.280 --> 54:12.280
OK

54:12.280 --> 54:14.280
Thank you all for your questions

54:14.280 --> 54:16.280
Then I will stop

54:16.280 --> 54:18.280
That's all for today's speech

54:18.280 --> 54:20.280
I will stop recording
