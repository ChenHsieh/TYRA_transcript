00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to the Terra Talks on April 27th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our speaker today is Dr. Zhang Changming,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
who is currently working as a postdoc at Technical University of Munich in Germany.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today's theme is Photoelectrochemical Solar Field Production, Progress and Prospects.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Changming did his undergraduate degree in Technical University of Munich,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then went to UC Berkeley to do his Ph.D. and postdoc.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He is now doing his second research in Germany.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We are very happy to welcome Changming to give us his latest speech. Thank you.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you, Yu-Tung. Hello everyone.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Can I speak like this?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sorry if my speech is a bit laggy today.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's 5 a.m. in Europe,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and I'm having my first cup of coffee,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so it might be a bit slow.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you have any questions,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
please feel free to interrupt me.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Looking back at the previous theme,

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
it seems a bit too broad,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but basically today I want to share with you

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
some of the results of the past two or three years.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
From our perspective,

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
we need to use a lot of energy.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
According to statistics,

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the average energy consumption per year is 18 terawatts.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Of course, as technology advances, the number will continue to increase.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It is estimated that in about 30 years,

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
this number will increase to 60 terawatts.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This means that we need to find a source of new energy.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So far, most of this energy has come from so-called fossil fuels.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Of course, we have been burning fossil fuels,

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
which means that we keep putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We can also see that this is a project by UC San Diego.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They started tracking the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from Hawaii in the 1950s.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We can see that in 2015,

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
this concentration has officially broken through the 400ppm level.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course, this also causes the so-called global warming problem.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In order to solve this problem,

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
it means that we need to find a source of new energy at the same time,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and at the same time avoid creating more carbon dioxide.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This means that we need to find some energy that does not emit carbon dioxide.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A very ideal choice, of course, is solar energy.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
For example, here we can see that on the surface of the earth every year,

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the input energy of solar energy is 120,000 terawatts.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is far more than what we need.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So in recent years,

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
we also know that solar energy devices are increasing all over the world.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But so far, it's about 300 to 400 gigawatts.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So there is still some time to go on the energy of the device.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But we can also predict that there is a problem.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The source of solar energy is not a very stable source.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It is related to the weather and the season.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So we need to have a way to store the excess solar energy.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In this regard, there are usually two directions.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
One, of course, is the so-called development battery.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I won't talk about most of this today.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's not my own field.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But in another part,

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in addition to storing energy by battery,

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
my field is how to store the excess solar energy by chemical energy.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How do we do this?

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Basically, our goal is to convert solar energy into fuel.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Our first method is the so-called electromagnetic method.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's two parts.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No matter what method we use to generate electricity,

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the excess electricity is generated by electricity.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Then we can make an electromagnetic cell.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Our battery is here.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We can put a blower in the positive and negative poles.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
For example, in the positive pole,

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
where the oxidation reaction occurs,

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
we can oxidize water into oxygen.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
In the negative pole, we convert water into hydrogen.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This hydrogen can be stored.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then it can be used as fuel.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Whether it's solar power,

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
or the source of the electric car with the fuel cell.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This method is purely electromagnetic.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
To do this,

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
for example, to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In thermodynamics,

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
we need about 1.23 volts.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is the most basic requirement.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But in fact,

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
no matter what chemical reaction we have,

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
there is a so-called kinetic barrier.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We have to overcome this barrier on both sides.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In fact, we need about 1.7 to 1.8 volts

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to do the so-called water-soluble reaction.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is one approach.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The other approach is to combine these two steps into one.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We directly convert light into fuel.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How do we do this?

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
For example, we can put an N-shaped semiconductor

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
in the positive pole.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
When we put the N-shaped semiconductor into the water,

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
there will be a shocky barrier on the interface.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So its shock absorber and conductor will go up.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
After absorbing light, we have electromagnetic current.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because of the band bending,

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the current will flow in the direction of the solution.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This current can be used to

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
do the oxidation reaction,

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
to oxidize water into oxygen.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This means that if we do it this way,

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
we need 1.7 to 1.8 volts.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The voltage depends on

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the band gap of the semiconductor.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In terms of experience,

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the light voltage can only do

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
up to 70% of the band gap.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This means that if we want to use the same semiconductor

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to provide voltage for the solution of water,

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
we need a semiconductor with a voltage above 2.5 eV.

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This means that most of the light in the solar system

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is not easy to use.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We can also improve our approach.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We use different semiconductors in the positive and negative poles.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
For example, in the positive pole,

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
we use a N-shaped semiconductor with a slightly larger band gap.

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then we can do the oxidation reaction.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
After the short-wave long-wave light is absorbed,

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the long-wave long-wave light can still pass through.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We use a smaller band gap.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
At this time, we use a P-shaped semiconductor.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So its light electrons will run in the direction of the solution

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
to do the oxidation reaction.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is the bottom layer of the semiconductor.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
In this way, we can choose the most optimized band gap combination.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We can use most of the light in the solar system

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to produce enough light voltage

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to produce the so-called CO2 photoreduction,

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
which is more difficult

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
whether it is to produce hydrogen or the recently more popular,

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
which is to convert CO2 into chemical fuel.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So my research focuses on the so-called photoelectrochemical

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
solar energy conversion.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Today I will talk about

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
an example of a P-type photocastle.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will also introduce some N-type photoanodes.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We want to find a suitable light-electrode material.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How do we define the efficiency of a photocastle?

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How do we find a photocastle with high efficiency?

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Basically, when we develop a photocastle,

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
we define its efficiency

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
based on how much light current we can get.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
For example, this is our photocastle in the middle.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We can apply different potentials to the photocastle.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Then we measure how much current we have.

150
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We can carry out this experiment

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
without photocastle or photocastle.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The gap in the middle is the so-called light current,

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
which is to convert light into current.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because there is current, it means

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that a circuit is formed between the entire furnace and the photocastle.

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This means that there is a chemical reaction

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
between the furnace and the circuit.

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Of course, the higher the light current, the higher the efficiency.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Basically, the intensity of the light entering the photocastle

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
is defined, because it is the radiance of the sun.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It is about the intensity of the global average.

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So the light entering the photocastle is fixed.

163
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If we analyze this way, the light current we get

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is related to the three efficiency factors of our material.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The first efficiency factor is the efficiency of the photocastle.

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Of course, the smaller the bandgap, the stronger the photocastle's ability.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There will be more electromagnetic waves

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
under the same photocastle.

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
After the electromagnetic waves are generated,

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
they need to move to the easy interface.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
During this process, there may be so-called recombination.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The electromagnetic recombination disappears.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This means that it will reduce our efficiency.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So in order to have high charge separation efficiency,

175
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
we need our material to have a better carrier transport property.

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Finally, when our electromagnetic or electromagnetic waves

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
reach the surface of the photocastle,

178
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
they need to do a charge transfer to the photocastle

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to carry out our chemical reaction.

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But these reactions are usually slower

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and have a connected barrier.

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So we will also have some efficiency losses.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because these electromagnetic or electromagnetic waves

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
will stop at the surface

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
until there is enough time for the chemical reaction.

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
During this waiting time, there will also be so-called surface recombination.

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In addition to these factors,

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we also hope that our material does not require

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
a too expensive method of synthesis

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
or does not require some very rare elements.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It will be a little cheaper in terms of production cost.

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Another point is that

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
these inorganic materials hate water very much.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It is very different from the water that humans or animals need.

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
These inorganic materials,

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
especially when you add a voltage to it in the water,

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it is very likely to decompose or be unstable.

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
In order to do this,

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
we ultimately want to make this technology

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
into a large-scale mature technology

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that can solve the energy problems of humans.

202
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So we hope that the cost is low,

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
it is stable and efficient.

204
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So we can take a look at our current

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
so-called solar cell

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
some more mature semiconductors in this field,

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
such as silicon.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It is efficient enough.

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We also have very mature technology

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
that can do large-scale mass production,

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
but it is unstable in water.

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The so-called tribozoic semiconductor is also very efficient,

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
but it is basically unable to do large-scale mass production at present.

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They also have stability problems.

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So my own research and

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
many people in the academic world are currently studying the so-called

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
metal oxide.

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
These are easier to manufacture

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and at the same time quite stable in water.

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But a big common problem is that

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
these metal oxides are undergoing

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
so-called energy conversion.

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The efficiency of this application is

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
very, very different from silicon.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Our goal is to find out why

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the efficiency of these metal oxides is still so low.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
After understanding these reasons,

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
we hope to use these knowledge to guide us

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
to find a new material

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that can meet these three needs at the same time.

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So in the first part, I will

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
use this example,

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the so-called copper iron oxide.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It is a P-type photocasol.

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Then in the second part, I will

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
mention some so-called copper vanadium oxide

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
as a photogano.

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The so-called photocasols

239
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
are a P-type material.

240
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
After it is absorbed, it is easily

241
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
re-reacted on the surface.

242
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Basically, most oxidants are N-type

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
because it is easy to have so-called oxygen vacancy.

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This is a native N-type defect.

245
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So it is a bit difficult to find P-type oxidants.

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The most common P-type oxidant is

247
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
sulfuric acid or copper oxide.

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This material has actually been studied

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
in the field of solar cells quite thoroughly.

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
In terms of solar cells,

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
it can also have a pretty good efficiency.

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But the problem is that

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
we want to do photoelectrochemical energy conversion.

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
In the water, this material is very, very unstable.

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It means that it will die in five minutes.

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The reason for the death is that

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
we can see that its conduction band is mainly

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
copper 4s orbital.

259
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
After you light it up, the electrons in the conduction band

260
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
will convert a copper to a metal copper.

261
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It means that in a very short time,

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
our oxidant will gradually be converted to metal.

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So how do we improve this material?

264
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
One way is to add a second metal.

265
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
These are some common examples.

266
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The advantage is that

267
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
because we still have a copper in our material,

268
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
these oxides are still native P-type.

269
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Another advantage is that

270
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
after adding the second metal,

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
we can adjust our bandgap.

272
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Either push the radiance band up

273
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
or lower the conduction band.

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
In this way, our bandgap is reduced.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We can use solar cells more efficiently.

276
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Another advantage is that

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
after we change the character of the minimum conduction band,

278
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
we can reduce the chance of restoring the copper.

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We can make the material more stable.

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So the first topic I want to talk about is

281
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
copper iron oxide.

282
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It looks like a very attractive material.

283
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Because no matter copper or iron,

284
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
there are a lot of elements in the earth.

285
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So the cost is very low in production.

286
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The structure is here.

287
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There are six oxides in every three iron atoms.

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So it's a composite structure of the surface.

289
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Copper is a linear composite structure.

290
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's basically a layer-by-layer structure.

291
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Basically, if you look at the literature,

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
there are many different ways

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to composite this material.

294
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But there is a very interesting way.

295
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hello.

296
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I can't hear Tom's voice right now.

297
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Did you accidentally mute yourself?

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I just got back.

299
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay.

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I just had some...

301
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Can everyone see the screen now?

302
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I can see it now.

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay.

304
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Can everyone see the screen now?

305
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can see it now.

306
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay.

307
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Did you cut off from here?

308
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes.

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay.

310
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So basically,

311
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
if you go back to the literature,

312
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
there are several different ways to composite copper iron oxide.

313
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The first way is called Sol-gel synthesis.

314
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's basically a spin-coating method.

315
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You can see from the image of the electronic microscope

316
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that it's a pretty tight film.

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The blue data here is the so-called C-V curve.

318
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That is to say,

319
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
under different voltages,

320
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
how much light current do we have?

321
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It has this up and down jump

322
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
because sometimes there is light,

323
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and sometimes there is no light.

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So the gap in the middle is the so-called photocurrent.

325
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The blue one is the so-called action-reduction reaction.

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That is to say,

327
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
we put a lot of oxygen in copper iron.

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oxygen is also an easy-to-restore molecule.

329
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So we can see that

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
this material can effectively restore oxygen.

331
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But if we want to make it HER,

332
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
so-called hydrogen evolution,

333
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
which is to restore water to hydrogen,

334
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
we don't see how much current there is.

335
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That means the surface of this material

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
is not very efficient for so-called hydrogen evolution.

337
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We also found that

338
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the main problem is

339
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
when you put this material in the water,

340
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
there will be a surface hydroxide layer.

341
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The electron will be trapped in this layer

342
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
instead of being transferred to the water to produce hydrogen.

343
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But the interesting thing is

344
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
you can also synthesize this material in the so-called electromagnetic way.

345
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
From the surface map of the electron microscope,

346
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
there are a lot of these small nanoparticles.

347
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That means its surface area is getting bigger.

348
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
At the same time,

349
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
the materials made by electromagnetic method

350
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
are not entirely pure carbon iron oxide.

351
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It is easy to have so-called copper oxide,

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the second oxygen bucket in it.

353
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This material is not only

354
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
compared with the previous SOLDIER,

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
but it can also be used

356
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
for CO2 photoreduction, which is theoretically more difficult.

357
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Our CO2 is a very stable molecule.

358
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Why are there so many differences in the activity

359
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
compared with the previous SOLDIER?

360
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We can see here that

361
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
the morphology is basically very different.

362
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And the purity of the material is also very different.

363
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So the first goal is to

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
make a controllable synthesis method.

365
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We can adjust the purity of the material

366
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
while maintaining the same morphology.

367
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
In this way, we can determine

368
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
whether the source of this activity

369
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
is the activity of the material itself

370
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
or the activity of the secondary phase.

371
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The method we have is

372
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Reactive Sputtering.

373
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We have two targets, copper and iron.

374
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We can have two negative targets.

375
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We use argon plasma to hit the target

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and deposit the material on the substrate.

377
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
In this way, we can make a large-scale,

378
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
easy-to-produce scale.

379
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
For example, we can easily make 5x5 cm2.

380
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But in the industry,

381
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
it is easy to scale up to tens of centimeters.

382
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We can also adjust the ratio of copper and iron in the material.

383
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The middle is the ratio of copper and iron.

384
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In 1 to 1, we get a very pure carbon dioxide phase.

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We can see it from X-ray scattering

386
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
or from Laman-Campbell scattering.

387
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It is a very pure material.

388
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But when we add more iron,

389
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
we can see some secondary phase.

390
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We can identify that it is mainly oxidized iron.

391
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
On the other hand, if we put more copper in,

392
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the secondary phase we see is 2 plus oxidized copper.

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
After we have this series of materials,

394
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
we can make some more large-scale comparisons.

395
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Whether it is the photoelectrochemical performance

396
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
or the material used to identify its optical properties,

397
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
its carrier transport properties,

398
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
or the electronic structure of the material.

399
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
First of all, in the so-called photoelectrochemical performance,

400
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
we do the same measurement first.

401
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This is not the so-called hydrogen evolution.

402
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We add this sodium persafate.

403
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is a so-called electron scavenger.

404
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It means that it is also easy to be restored.

405
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If you still remember this tetrahedron,

406
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
we add a very easy-to-be-restored thing in the solution.

407
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It means that we assume that the last charge injection efficiency

408
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is very efficient, which is basically 1.

409
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We can see that we get about 1 mA per cm2.

410
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So much current.

411
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But if we don't add this thing,

412
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
it means that we want to do a hydrogen evolution.

413
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Our current density is reduced by about 20 times.

414
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
This is the so-called pure material.

415
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If we look at the material in this series we just had,

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
in the case of the electron scavenger on the left,

417
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the density of the current is basically the same.

418
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But on the right, we can see that

419
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
in the case where the copper ratio is higher,

420
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
the density of our current is obviously higher.

421
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We can see that there is also another peak in the CV data.

422
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
This peak means that there is an additional oxidation reaction in the material.

423
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
If you still remember,

424
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
these more copper samples are actually non-pure oxidized carbon dioxide.

425
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
From this data, we can deduce that

426
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
especially in the lower right corner,

427
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
the higher current for CO2 reduction

428
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is actually due to the oxidation of copper as a catalyst.

429
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So no matter what,

430
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
our copper dioxide is just a catalyst.

431
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
On the surface, it can't restore CO2.

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But when you have an excess of oxidized copper,

433
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
these oxidized copper will first be restored to oxidized arsenic or metal copper

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
to act as a catalyst.

435
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Next, we're going to do a light quality measurement.

436
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
We're using the so-called spectroscopic isometry.

437
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
We can analyze its absorption rate.

438
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We can also do a tau analysis.

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We find that it's an indirect semiconductor.

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The bandgap is about 1.43eV.

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Its direct bandgap is about 3.09eV.

442
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But as we said earlier,

443
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
our light current density is about 1mA per cm2.

444
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But if we look at its bandgap at 1.4,

445
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it can actually absorb a lot of light.

446
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
If we compare the light we absorb

447
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
with the ratio of current we get,

448
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
that's our conversion efficiency.

449
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
If we calculate this efficiency,

450
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
it's actually less than 10%.

451
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That means after more than 90% of the light is absorbed,

452
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
we can't take it out of the semiconductor interface.

453
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That means a lot of recombination occurs.

454
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
This recombination,

455
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
when we look at these new oxidizing materials,

456
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it's a very common and the biggest limitation.

457
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
This is mainly a comparison.

458
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The gray one is the so-called photosymbol diffraction.

459
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That is to say, we measure the absorption of the material.

460
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
After the material absorbs light,

461
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
we convert the energy of light into heat.

462
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We can see that it has a very fast sharp onset.

463
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The red one is the so-called photo-to-current efficiency.

464
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Its onset is also in the bandgap,

465
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
but its increase is significantly slower.

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That means in visible light,

467
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
at 500 to 800 nm,

468
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
in this visible light area,

469
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
a lot of light can be absorbed,

470
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
but it can't be used as a photo-to-current.

471
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
At the same time, in the sub-bandgap,

472
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
we see a relatively small absorption peak.

473
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We will come back to discuss what this is later.

474
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We say that these oxidizing materials,

475
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
especially the common limitation of super-resistant oxidizing materials,

476
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
is the so-called bulk recombination.

477
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Why is it like this?

478
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
If we look at these super-resistant metals,

479
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
we look at its band structure,

480
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
its 3D orbital is not fully filled.

481
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If we use the general band theory to look at it,

482
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
it should actually be a metal material.

483
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Why are these oxidizing materials a semiconductor,

484
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
even though it is a super-resistant material?

485
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That's because these electrons have strong interactions with each other.

486
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That means that because of these interactions,

487
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
our metal 3D band will split into the so-called sub-band and sub-band.

488
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
At the same time, we have oxides in the oxidizing material.

489
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So depending on the oxygen 2P band

490
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
is in a place with lower energy

491
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
or a place with higher energy,

492
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
we can have these two types of insulators.

493
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
One is the Moharber insulator,

494
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
which means that the sub-band and sub-band are all metal 3D.

495
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Or the sub-band is metal oxygen 2P

496
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and the sub-band is metal 3D.

497
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
No matter which type,

498
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
in these oxidizing materials,

499
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
because they are, how to put it,

500
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
compared to the traditional silicon or 3-5 group semiconductors,

501
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
the characteristics of these oxidizing materials are that

502
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
although they are also semiconductors,

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
but our electrons have to pass through them.

504
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Because these oxidizing materials are more ionic,

505
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
we have,

506
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
so the electrons have to jump around in different atoms.

507
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
For example, in this case in the upper right corner,

508
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
our electrons have to jump around in different metal atoms.

509
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And the electrons have to jump around in different oxygen atoms.

510
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
This means that our electrons are very localized.

511
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
In the process of localization,

512
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,000
it will also change the structure of the metal around it.

513
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It means that the structure will be a little different.

514
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What does this affect?

515
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It means that their mobility will be worse.

516
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Just like in ordinary silicon,

517
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
it doesn't have this localized electron problem.

518
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's like going for a walk in the wild.

519
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Basically, no one will stop you.

520
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You can go wherever you want.

521
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
In these oxidizing materials,

522
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
for example, there are a lot of people in Simending.

523
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
If you want to go to a place,

524
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
it means that the people you want to go to

525
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
have to leave a space for you to go there.

526
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It means that in the process of walking,

527
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the environment around you will also change with you.

528
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Of course, the mobility will be much lower.

529
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We think that these oxidizing materials have poor charge mobility.

530
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
At the same time, for this reason,

531
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
we have a lot of bulk recombination.

532
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
How do we prove this hypothesis?

533
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
At the beginning, after oxidation,

534
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
the electromagnetic electron localized

535
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
to produce the so-called polaron.

536
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
This process is very fast.

537
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So we want to use the so-called

538
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
phantocyclic contraction absorption

539
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
to observe this phenomenon.

540
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Basically, a very typical measurement is like this.

541
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
First, we use a very short pump pulse

542
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
to produce an oxidized state.

543
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Because the oxidized state

544
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
has a different electronic arrangement from the machine,

545
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
so its absorption of different light will also be different.

546
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We can use the second probing

547
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
to measure the difference in absorption

548
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
of different oxidized states.

549
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
We can change the delay between the pump and probe,

550
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
so that we can follow

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
how it relaxes after producing the oxidized state.

552
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But this method is basically

553
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
applied to the liquid state at the beginning.

554
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We found that we are now

555
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
studying solid materials.

556
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So in addition to the so-called transmission,

557
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
we also have to consider reflectivity.

558
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
This means that we have to measure

559
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the so-called transmission, transmission,

560
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and transmission reflectivity at the same time.

561
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I skipped some details,

562
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
but the point is that

563
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
if we measure transmission and reflectivity at the same time,

564
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
we can return to the so-called differential absorption.

565
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
In the case of solid materials,

566
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
we can see this kind of

567
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
first-order or third-order

568
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
differential signal.

569
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
This is because different absorption oscillators

570
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
are either produced by shift

571
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
or oscillators by broadening.

572
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is how we used another material

573
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
to build this analysis.

574
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Back to our carbon monoxide,

575
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
this is our transmission absorption data.

576
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We can see that there are many changes

577
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
in the area near the interwebbing gap and the interwebbing gap.

578
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
At the same time, in the sub-webbing gap,

579
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that is, in the infrared part,

580
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
there is a very flat absorption.

581
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
This is the so-called free carrier absorption,

582
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
which means that after being absorbed,

583
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
the free carrier absorption will appear in this area.

584
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
This free carrier absorption is actually very short-lived.

585
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
In about 1 picosecond,

586
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
this signal disappears.

587
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
At the same time,

588
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
for example,

589
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
near the interwebbing gap,

590
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
there is a relatively long-lived excited state.

591
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We think this is indirect evidence that

592
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
our free carrier localizes

593
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and produces a polaron state.

594
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This means that after 1 picosecond,

595
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
we don't have a real free carrier,

596
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
but a polaron.

597
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
These polarons can still be charged transport,

598
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
but their mobility is relatively much lower.

599
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Next, about the so-called electronic structure,

600
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
we first have a cooperation,

601
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
using the DFT plus U method to calculate,

602
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
to calculate the electronic structure according to the crystal structure.

603
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The middle part of 0 is the Fermi level.

604
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
The low energy part on the left is the so-called valence band.

605
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We see that from the calculation process,

606
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
at the top of the valence band,

607
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
the closest to the valence band edge is

608
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
mainly the copper 3D electron.

609
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The lower part is the oxygen.

610
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The lower part is the so-called iron 3D.

611
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
In the conduction band part,

612
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
there are two bands, iron 3D.

613
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The higher part is copper.

614
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We want to do an experiment to verify the calculation structure.

615
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The first experiment is to use the so-called XPS.

616
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It means that we use an X-ray

617
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
to isolate the valence band electron.

618
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
According to the analysis of these photoelectron's

619
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
kinetic energy,

620
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
we can return the binding energy in the material.

621
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
We can see that there are four peaks.

622
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The two peaks at the top are

623
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
similar to the copper in the calculation result.

624
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
The next two peaks are

625
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
similar to the oxygen and iron.

626
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You may ask,

627
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
why does the ratio in the experiment

628
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
look different from the calculation?

629
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's because in the experiment,

630
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the ionization cross-section of the X-ray

631
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
is different for different elements.

632
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
In our experiment,

633
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
the ionization cross-section of the copper

634
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
is much higher than that of the oxygen or iron.

635
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
This explains why in our experiment,

636
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
the intensity of the two peaks at the top

637
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
is much higher than the other two peaks.

638
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
We can also use the so-called X-ray emission.

639
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That means we also use the X-ray,

640
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
but now we isolate the electron.

641
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Let's see how the electron of the valence band

642
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
returns the binding energy.

643
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
In the process of returning the binding energy,

644
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
we will emit an X-ray beam.

645
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We can analyze the beam of the X-ray beam

646
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
to get the distribution of the valence band.

647
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Here we see that in the oxygen,

648
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
the K-edge X-ray emission,

649
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
we also see four peaks.

650
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
In this process,

651
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
because we are looking at the co-level excitation of oxygen,

652
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
of course,

653
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
when the valence band is returned,

654
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
what we see is that

655
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
more electrons are returned from oxygen.

656
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
That's why we see that

657
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
the intensity of the peak in the middle is higher.

658
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
This is the valence band.

659
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The conduction band,

660
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
in the calculation process,

661
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
we see that the two lowest conduction bands are iron,

662
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
mainly from the unoccupied iron orbital.

663
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We use the X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

664
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
In this method,

665
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
we measure from the co-level

666
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
to the unoccupied conduction band level.

667
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Then we can change the input X-ray energy

668
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
to see how much light can be absorbed.

669
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We can compare.

670
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
For example, in oxidized iron,

671
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
we see two peaks.

672
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
This is because

673
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
for iron,

674
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
it is also a triangular iron.

675
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
There are six ions around it.

676
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It is an octahedral structure.

677
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So we can see that the 3D orbital of iron

678
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
is split into 1G and T2G levels.

679
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
In carbon monoxide,

680
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
we also see these two peaks

681
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
at the same energy.

682
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
At a higher level,

683
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
we find a new peak.

684
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
According to our calculations,

685
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
this may be produced

686
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
from the same unoccupied orbital.

687
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
We can also do this calculation.

688
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
This is also done with DFT,

689
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,000
using the many-body X-ray absorption calculation.

690
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We can almost reproduce these three peaks.

691
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
We can also choose

692
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
from the calculation results.

693
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
These three different peaks

694
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
correspond to different final states.

695
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
We can see that the first peak

696
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
is the non-bonding state of oxygen and iron.

697
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The second peak

698
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
is also the anti-bonding state between oxygen and iron.

699
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The highest energy peak

700
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
is the anti-bonding state of copper and oxygen.

701
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
This means that we not only

702
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
verified that our calculations were correct,

703
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
but also that the two lower peaks

704
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
were contributed by iron,

705
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
while the highest peak was contributed by copper.

706
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
We can understand how different peaks

707
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
or different conduction bands

708
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
interact with each other.

709
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
How do we verify this?

710
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We can combine the different X-ray spectrums

711
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
into the so-called

712
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Resonance in Elastic X-ray Scattering.

713
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Basically, we use different X-ray spectrums

714
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
to stimulate an electron

715
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
from the core level to the conduction band.

716
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But we can also change the energy of the injected X-ray.

717
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
We can analyze

718
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
the X-ray emission

719
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
from the valence band.

720
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What are the different changes?

721
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
This is also done in the advanced slide source of Berkeley.

722
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Our sample is placed here.

723
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We have a green X-ray.

724
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We are analyzing the energy of the X-ray emission.

725
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
If you still remember,

726
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
two slides ago,

727
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
we said this is the K-H X-ray emission of oxygen.

728
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The middle peak

729
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
is the contribution from oxygen to P

730
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
in the valence band.

731
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The so-called RIGS data

732
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
is the same measurement,

733
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
but we change the different excitation energy.

734
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The diagram looks a bit complicated,

735
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
but the X-axis is the same X-ray emission.

736
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The Y-axis is the different excitation energy.

737
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
When we change the excitation energy,

738
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:18,000
the shape of the X-ray emission changes a lot.

739
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
In the first part, we can see the emission onset.

740
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
When we increase the excitation energy,

741
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
it moves to a higher energy level.

742
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This means our material is an indirect semiconductor.

743
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Why?

744
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
In our direct semiconductor,

745
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the valence band maximum and condensation minimum

746
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
are in the same K-space.

747
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
When we increase the excitation energy,

748
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the X-ray emission moves to a lower energy level.

749
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But in the indirect semiconductor,

750
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
the valence band maximum and condensation minimum

751
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
are separated.

752
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
When we increase the excitation energy,

753
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
the X-ray emission moves to a higher energy level.

754
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
This is what we observe here.

755
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
At the same time,

756
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:24,000
we can see some other changes.

757
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
For example, when we emit at these two peaks,

758
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
we can see that the peak at the low energy level is more obvious.

759
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But when we move to the third peak,

760
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
we can't see this peak.

761
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Instead, we can see another sharp peak at the high energy level.

762
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
This means that when we emit at this peak,

763
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
we are emitting at an unoccupied copper state.

764
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
This means that our X-ray emission

765
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
will have more copper 3D characters in the valence band.

766
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
In other words, when we emit at two low-energy peaks,

767
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
we see our own emission and lower-energy iron 3D emission.

768
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But when we emit at the third peak,

769
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
which is the so-called unoccupied copper state,

770
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
we will see more copper 3D emission.

771
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
This can explain the different changes we see.

772
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
This means that we not only know

773
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
that we are an indirect semiconductor.

774
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
The bandgap is 1.4 eV.

775
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We also know that our valence band is copper.

776
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Our conduction band minimum is iron.

777
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
This is a so-called metal-to-metal charge transfer semiconductor.

778
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:58,000
We can also do a similar measurement at the so-called iron L-edge.

779
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
In this method, we see that

780
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
X-ray emission and excitation energy are closely related.

781
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
In this method, we can see that

782
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
the first diagonal line is the so-called elastic scattering.

783
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
This means that it is the same energy as the X-ray emission.

784
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So basically nothing happens.

785
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But in the parallel direction,

786
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
we can see that there are two or three diagonal peaks.

787
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This means that no matter what X-ray excitation energy we use,

788
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
we all have a fixed energy loss.

789
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
This is the same principle as our optical Raman scattering.

790
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
In Raman, this fixed energy loss tells us

791
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
what is the energy of the lattice vibration.

792
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
In this technique, this fixed energy loss tells us some different information.

793
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
How do we explain it?

794
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We can also compare these different X-ray emissions.

795
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
This is not absolute X-ray emission energy,

796
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
but how much energy loss there is in the following.

797
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
In other words, we use a diagonal method to align these emissions.

798
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
We see that there are three fixed energy losses.

799
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
The first is about one electron volt.

800
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
That is, no matter what energy we use to excite,

801
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
we lose a fixed electron volt.

802
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Why is this?

803
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,000
This is the configuration of our ground state.

804
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It has five electrons and a high-spin configuration.

805
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
When we do an X-ray excitation,

806
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
we have a cold hole.

807
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So we have an electric current at 2P.

808
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
We have an extra electron in 3D.

809
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
When it returns to the final state,

810
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
it can return to its original state.

811
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That is, there is no energy loss.

812
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Or it can return to a quadrilateral state.

813
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
This means that this energy loss is equivalent to

814
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
a spin from our ground state.

815
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
This electron volt energy loss

816
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
represents a TD excitation energy loss.

817
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
If you remember,

818
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
when we measured the absorption of light on both sides,

819
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
there was a small peak at the South Bank.

820
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It was at about 1,200 nanometers.

821
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
If you convert it to the energy scale,

822
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
it is actually an electron volt.

823
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
This means that in practice,

824
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
we can actually observe this very weak absorption.

825
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Then there are two other fans.

826
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
What is the reason for this?

827
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
This is also the so-called intermediate state.

828
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
At first, we put an electron in the iron conduction band.

829
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Then we have an electric current.

830
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
This intermediate state is actually coupling with other intermediate states.

831
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
That means that when it returns to the final state,

832
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,000
what we see can be a charge transfer from oxygen to iron,

833
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
or a charge transfer from copper to iron.

834
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
When they return to the final state,

835
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
the energy difference from the initial state to the final state

836
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
will reflect the energy loss here.

837
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
The first one we see is about negative five to negative six electron volts.

838
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Compared with our calculation results,

839
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
it is a charge transfer from oxygen to iron.

840
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:11,000
The energy loss in the middle is about two to four electron volts.

841
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It is actually several peaks coupled together.

842
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
If we compare it with our optical absorption,

843
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
we can see that there are three peaks.

844
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
If we compare them,

845
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
they can basically be put together.

846
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
That means that the energy loss peak in the middle,

847
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
which is about three electron volts,

848
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
is mainly due to the charge transfer from copper to iron.

849
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
This energy loss can also be compared with our optical absorption.

850
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
In conclusion,

851
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
we used the Reactive Spotter to prepare this series of samples.

852
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:06,000
We can separate the so-called impurity phase and morphology.

853
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
We learned that

854
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
carbon dioxide itself does not have CO2 reduction activity.

855
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
This activity is mainly due to the fact that

856
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
when we have more copper,

857
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
the oxidized carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst.

858
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
We used a lot of different X-ray optical methods

859
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
to understand its electron structure.

860
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
We found that its valence band is mainly of copper 3D nature,

861
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and the connection band is of iron 3D nature.

862
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
This means that

863
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
if we look at the structure of the metal,

864
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
we can see that it is a layer by layer structure of copper oxide or iron oxide.

865
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
This means that if we can control the direction of the growth of the metal

866
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
on the magnetic back,

867
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
maybe we can more efficiently separate the electrons and electrons

868
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
by using the Reactive Spotter.

869
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,000
If we can control the direction of the growth of the metal in a regular way.

870
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Okay, I think it's about time.

871
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Do you have any questions about this part?

872
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Thank you, Chang-Ming, for the wonderful speech.

873
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm going to stop the recording here,

874
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
and then we can start the Q&A.
