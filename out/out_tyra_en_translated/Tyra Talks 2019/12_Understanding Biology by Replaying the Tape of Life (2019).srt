00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you, Dr. He Wei-Ching, for giving us an online lecture.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My host today is me, I am Jay Chou.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I am currently working as a postdoc at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today I will introduce some of Dr. He Wei-Ching's background.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dr. He Wei-Ching received her master's degree from the Department of Life Sciences, National Taiwan University, from 2004 to 2008.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She then received her master's degree from the Institute of Zoology, National Taiwan University, from 2008 to 2010.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
After receiving her master's degree, she worked as a research assistant at the Department of Life Sciences for one year.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
From 2011 to 2017, she received her Ph.D. degree from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
After receiving her Ph.D. degree, she is currently working as a postdoc research associate at the Center for the Mechanism of Evolution,

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and a postdoc research associate at the Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Today, I am honored to invite Dr. He Wei-Ching to give us an online lecture.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Her topic is Understanding Biology by Replaying the Type of Life, Experimental Evolution of the E. coli as an Example.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's welcome Dr. He Wei-Ching to give us an online lecture.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you for the introduction, and thank you, Tara, for giving me the opportunity to share my recent research with you.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I am a biophysicist, and my main concern is to study the diversity of life, how it evolves, and how we can predict the evolution of life.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Today, I am going to share with you some of the experiments that I am doing in the lab, using E. coli as a model species.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am a postdoc at Arizona State University.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We all know that biodiversity is very diverse in this world.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This problem also confuses many biophysicists.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How do these biodiversity evolve?

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Normally, many biophysicists go to the wild to observe these different forms of life, and then try to find some similarities with the different environmental factors in the wild.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Can you explain how these diversities evolve?

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
However, such research is usually difficult because there are too many environmental factors in the wild, so sometimes the researchers do not know which one to look at.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Therefore, it would be easier for everyone to study the evolution of biodiversity in a situation where there is a better control of mutations.

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In this situation, the famous ancient biologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote the book Wonderful Life.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This book mainly talks about the evolution of biodiversity related to the Cambrian explosion in the Berger scale.

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
More importantly, he proposed an experimental idea in this book.

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In other words, if you can see so many diversities on Earth, we will begin to think about whether the biodiversity in the biological world is a natural result of evolution or just a random result.

29
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
To distinguish whether it is a natural result or a random result, an experiment may be helpful to explain this.

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If you can press a button to wash away the previous biological evolution process to the very, very beginning stage, then you keep pressing the play button,

31
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and every time you press the play button, you will see if the biological evolution will have the same result.

32
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If this happens repeatedly, it means that the diversity we see is a natural result of evolution, not a random result.

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
At the time of this idea, he said in the book that he was very sad, because in fact this kind of experiment can only be thought of, and there is no way to do it.

34
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:30,000
However, in recent years, due to the development of experimental technologies in the laboratory and the progress of various molecular technologies, many people have tried to do so-called experimental evolution in the laboratory.

35
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In the process of experimental evolution, we can repeat many times of evolution and do it in a better environment.

36
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The most famous experimental evolution is Richard Alensky's E. coli long-term experimental evolution.

37
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is Richard Alensky and his E. coli long-term population.

38
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He started doing this experiment in 1988, and so far there have been more than 60,000 generations.

39
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He put the E. coli in the Glucose Minimum Media and passed it on to the new media every day.

40
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When he started this experiment, he had a total of 12 parallel populations, so he repeated the evolution process 12 times.

41
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Over the course of more than 20 years of evolution, his laboratory sent a lot of documents to introduce what happened to his E. coli.

42
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
In his reports on different phenotypes and genotypes, he also found different levels of repetition.

43
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
For example, in all of his populations, he saw an increase in fitness and even an increase in cell size.

44
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He argued that this may be related to nutrient acquisition.

45
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
However, in all of his populations, he only observed that half of the population would evolve to a higher rate of mutation.

46
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What he found more novel was that in all 12 populations, there was one population that evolved to use another chemical in the environment, citrate, as a carbon source of nutrient composition.

47
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:59,000
At the same time, he also observed some parallelism on genotypes, which means that some mutations are easier to detect than other mutations.

48
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
At the same time, he also saw that within this population, they began to form population structures.

49
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:17,000
However, after these discoveries, we have to ask, because he was only doing this in the same environment.

50
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If we want to fully understand how to predict the results of a mutation, we are not sure whether the phenomena he observed only occurred in the environment he started or in the bacteria he used.

51
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What is more important is that there are many different types of evolutionary forces in the process of mutation.

52
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Different evolutionary forces have different types, some of which will lead to de-mutation, some of which will lead to evolution, and so on.

53
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If we want to better understand the predictability of mutation, we will want to understand that these different evolutionary forces are related to different types of mutations.

54
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In the process of evolution, there are many different forces that will result in evolution.

55
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The most famous is the natural selection. The natural selection will lead to deterministic results, and the deterministic results will lead to deterministic results.

56
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In the process of evolution, there are many different forces that will result in evolution. The most famous is the natural selection.

57
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The natural selection will lead to deterministic results, because if your genotype is higher than the fitness of other genotypes, the genotype will spread faster in the population.

58
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
However, evolution is not only the natural selection of a force. Many other forces are also very important, and they play a random role.

59
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For example, mutation is the most basic force of evolution. Without mutation, it is basically impossible to produce a new shape.

60
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Another force is recombination. Recombination allows different species to get a new combination of genetic material.

61
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Another force, genetic drift, will also cause random changes.

62
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Here are some examples of genetic drift.

63
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Basically, genetic drift is the change in the frequency of genetic material in the evolution process of life.

64
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can imagine that there are some unpredictable factors in the evolution process, such as natural disasters that cause population size changes.

65
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Interestingly, if the population size is smaller in the genetic drift effect, the genetic drift effect will be stronger.

66
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Sometimes it will be so strong that the natural selection effect is overshadowed.

67
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The following two graphs are simulation results.

68
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This graph simulates the frequency of genetic mutations as the number of generations increases.

69
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If there are only 20 individuals in this group, you will see that after the 10th and 20th generations, the mutation may jump from the original 0.5 frequency to 1.

70
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This means that the entire population has this variation, or this variation is gone when the frequency of its variation becomes 0.

71
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
However, if the population size is 2000, you will see that the frequency of its variation is very small.

72
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What is the significance of this in evolution?

73
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It is because sometimes, as we just said, in the evolution process of the population, it may encounter some natural disasters or other environmental changes that cause the decline in the population size.

74
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So there is a very famous example of genetic drift called the bottleneck effect.

75
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:15,000
As shown in this graph, if the population size is very large at the very beginning on the far left, then the balls of different colors seem to be different genetic variations.

76
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
At the beginning, the genetic composition may be very consistent.

77
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
However, when the population size begins to decline, you can imagine that only a small number of balls are drawn from many, many balls.

78
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
At this time, the genetic composition will change significantly.

79
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When the population size decreases more and more, the frequency of genetic variation will change even more.

80
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
For example, in the end, you will find that the red part has gone from 20% to 70%.

81
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because there are different forces in the evolution process, we have carried out a lot of different experiments in the Lynch Lab where I am now.

82
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We want to test whether the evolution forces of different species will change the evolution results.

83
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In particular, we pay special attention to the impact of the mutation rate and the population bottlenecks.

84
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:49,000
In addition, we also want to try to see what would happen if the experimental evolution was carried out in a more complex environment.

85
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
In the previous Lynch Lab evolution process, the environment was relatively monotonous, with only glucose as its carbon source.

86
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:17,000
In our experimental design, we first chose a more complex cultivator, the LB cultivator.

87
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In the LB cultivator, there are many different amino acids that can be used as the source of carbon.

88
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In addition, we do not use the tracing bottle for experiments, but use the lynch lab for experiments.

89
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:45,000
When doing experiments in the lynch lab, you can imagine that there may be some differences in the degree of T in the entire lynch lab.

90
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
For example, the concentration of oxygen may be higher at the top and lower at the bottom.

91
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We use this method to make the experimental environment more complex.

92
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:07,000
In addition, we want to know the impact of the mutation rate on the experimental results.

93
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Therefore, we tried to use different genetic backgrounds to carry out the experimental evolution.

94
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We used the MUTEL gene in the wild type LB cultivator.

95
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Previous experiments have shown that if there is this gene, the mutation rate will increase by 150 times.

96
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The reason for this is that MUTEL is a very important molecule in the mismatch repair, as shown in the figure on the right.

97
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That is, when there is a mismatch in the DNA, for example, G should not be paired with T.

98
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:19,000
When this mismatch is detected by MUTEL and MUTX, it will recruit MUTH and other pathways to do DNA repair and put the correct pairing back.

99
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is why the mutation rate will increase by more than 150 times after MUTEL is deleted.

100
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:41,000
At the same time, if it is in the usual wild type environment, you can imagine that its mutation rate is very low, about 10 to the minus 10 per base per generation.

101
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
At the same time, we also used different dilution factors in the experimental setup.

102
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We have just introduced the start of different genetic backgrounds.

103
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
For each genetic background, we also tried three different bottleneck sizes.

104
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Next, I will use small, medium, and large to represent different bottleneck sizes.

105
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But the actual dilution factor is listed here.

106
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If it is the smallest bottleneck, there will be one-tenth of the population entering the new tube from the old cultivator to the new cultivator tube every day.

107
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can imagine that only one-tenth of the original population size will enter the new tube.

108
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If it is medium, it is one-fourth of 10.

109
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The strongest bottleneck is one-tenth of 10.

110
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Because we want to see if the results of different bottlenecks are repetitive,

111
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
we have eight repetitions in each genetic background and dilution factor treatment.

112
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This experiment has been carried out in Lynch Lab for three or four years.

113
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Today, I would like to share with you the results of the 900th day dilution.

114
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The first question is, after 900 days, is their adaptability better than before?

115
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
To answer this question, our strategy is to do a competition assay.

116
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The logic is quite simple.

117
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:01,000
At the beginning, we took some of the evolved population and some of the ancestor population.

118
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
After putting them in the same tube and mixing them, we immediately measured the ratio between them.

119
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
After 24 hours, let them compete with each other inside and then measure the ratio again.

120
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
In this way, we have the later ratio and the earlier ratio.

121
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
By comparing these two ratios, we can know how much the fitness of the evolved population has improved compared to the ancestor population.

122
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Then we do this to different parallel populations of different treatments.

123
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is the result of the experiment.

124
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
On the x-axis, we have some different treatments with different numbers.

125
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Different treatments, such as whether the population bottleneck size is small or large,

126
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
or whether the genetic background is the high-transmission rate of MMR- or wild type, are listed above.

127
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The y-axis is the fitness improvement relative to ancestor.

128
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
We measured at least three populations for each treatment,

129
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and at least three replicates for each evolved line.

130
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
This result shows that after doing the two-way ANOVA test,

131
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
we found that different genetic backgrounds did not have a significant impact.

132
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But the bottleneck size has a significant impact.

133
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
From this graph, we can see that if the bottleneck size is medium or large,

134
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
the fitness improvement is actually very small, much smaller than the small population bottleneck.

135
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This is calculated.

136
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Because we see the fitness improvement, we want to ask if the genetic material changes are consistent with the fitness changes.

137
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
During the experiment, we did a high-throughput sequencing every 100 days.

138
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
After doing the high-throughput DNA sequencing,

139
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
we used the Briseeq software to derive the allele frequency.

140
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Briseeq was developed to map the Lenski Long-Term Experimental Evolution software.

141
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,000
After the map was derived, we measured the amount of mutation for each time point.

142
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The amount of mutation was used to add up the derived allele frequency.

143
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:30,000
In addition, because the population bottleneck size is different in different treatments,

144
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it is possible that the bacteria that pass through the evolution process are different in generation.

145
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
During the experiment, we found that no matter how small or large the bottleneck is,

146
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
it can grow back to the maximum possible number of the population in one day.

147
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So we use this to estimate the generation number of bacteria.

148
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The smallest 1 over 10 dilution factor is calculated to be about 3.3 generations per day.

149
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The largest population bottleneck can reach 23 generations per day.

150
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:29,000
After obtaining these data, we plot them on this graph.

151
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
On this graph, the x-axis shows the number of generations,

152
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and 1000 is the unit.

153
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The y-axis shows the number of mutations.

154
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
SNP stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism.

155
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We take the average between different parallel experimental evolutions.

156
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You can see that the amount of mutation is very linear.

157
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Next, we want to compare the different treatments.

158
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Is there a difference in the speed of accumulation of the number of mutations on the gene?

159
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The B in each treatment graph is the regression slope.

160
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
If we compare the MMR minus, which is a higher mutation rate,

161
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
with the wild type, which is a lower mutation rate,

162
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and compare them with the same population bottleneck size,

163
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the MMR minus is higher.

164
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:58,000
However, the higher MMR minus is only 4 to 20 times higher,

165
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
less than 150 times higher than the initial mutation rate.

166
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If we compare the different population bottlenecks,

167
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
we will find that the higher the population bottleneck size,

168
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
the lower the accumulation rate of mutations on the gene.

169
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Can I ask a question?

170
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Sure.

171
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The MMR mutation rate is 150 times higher than the wild type.

172
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yes.

173
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR minus

174
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
has a higher mutation rate than the wild type?

175
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR minus has a higher mutation rate than the wild type?

176
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes.

177
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR minus has a higher mutation rate than the wild type?

178
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes.

179
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
First of all, they look similar, but the Y-axis is different.

180
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I forgot to mention this.

181
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You can see that the Y-axis is 10 times higher than the wild type.

182
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Although the mutation rate looks the same on the graph,

183
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the MMR minus mutation rate is 10 times higher than the wild type.

184
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The MMR minus mutation rate is 10 times higher than the wild type.

185
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Is there any experiment that can prove that the MMR mutation rate is 150 times higher than the wild type?

186
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes.

187
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
At the beginning, when I was talking about the MMR minus genetic background,

188
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I didn't say it very clearly.

189
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
In fact, 150 times is the result of the experiment.

190
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I guess I will talk about the method of experiment testing in the next slide.

191
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The method of experiment testing is the so-called universal accumulation experiment.

192
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
We call it the mutation accumulation experiment.

193
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
In the process of this experiment, we will raise these bacteria in the same way.

194
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But in the process of raising, we give it a very strong bottleneck.

195
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That is to say, every time we pass it on, we only pick one colony to pass on.

196
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So you can imagine that unless the mutation kills the bacteria,

197
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
otherwise all mutations can be retained in the bacteria.

198
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
In the process of this mutation accumulation experiment,

199
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:24,000
it is passed on for more than 60 days with only one colony left every day.

200
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:43,000
In this way, you can know how many new mutations have occurred after 60 days.

201
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Then the new mutation is divided by the number of generations and the mutation rate is obtained.

202
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The mutation rate mentioned in the first slide,

203
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
For example, the 10 to the power of 10 times per base pair per generation,

204
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
is measured like this.

205
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
In today's presentation, we have used another faster way.

206
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We will discuss this later.

207
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
At the same time, we are also using the mutation accumulation method

208
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
to measure the evolved mutation rate.

209
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Indeed, as I mentioned earlier,

210
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
there is a very intuitive explanation,

211
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
that is, the mutation rate dropped during the evolution process,

212
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and our data also shows this.

213
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
This is what I just explained.

214
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
In the experiment process,

215
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
there is another group of experiments to measure the evolved mutation rate.

216
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
This is the so-called mutation accumulation experiment.

217
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There are many parallel experiments.

218
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The point is that every time we transfer,

219
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
we lose a very, very strong population bottleneck.

220
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
There is probably only one group.

221
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then we have to try to keep all the mutations.

222
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So after this process,

223
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
we can imagine,

224
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
we can use host-genome sequencing to see how many mutations there are.

225
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Then we can measure the mutation rate.

226
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This kind of mutation rate should be the evolution rate of the genome.

227
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
If the following things are correct,

228
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
first, if the mutation rate has not changed,

229
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
second, if there is no subpopulation structure.

230
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Because if there is a subpopulation structure,

231
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
it will limit the number of mutations in each new genome

232
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
to the extent that it cannot spread to the entire group.

233
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So the evolution rate is also reduced.

234
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
In addition, we have to assume that

235
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
if all the mutations do not kill the bacteria,

236
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
it has no effect on fitness.

237
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Because in the previous paper,

238
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I have measured the mutation rate of MAR- and wild-type.

239
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Then in this picture,

240
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I drew it on the virtual line.

241
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That is to say, the virtual line means

242
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
if the assumption was established before,

243
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
that is, the evolution rate has not changed,

244
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
then all the mutations have no effect on fitness,

245
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and then there is no subpopulation structure,

246
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
then we would expect to see

247
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
so many mutations shown on the virtual line.

248
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But we can see that

249
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
in the virtual expectation

250
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and the actual color line observation,

251
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
the actual evolution rate observed by MAR-

252
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is lower than the virtual line.

253
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
On the other hand, the wild-type is actually higher.

254
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So there are some different hypotheses

255
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
to explain this.

256
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Hello, I have another question.

257
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Is the virtual line and the actual line

258
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
experimental environment completely identical?

259
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Yes, they are all LB.

260
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And they are all column-shaped bottles.

261
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes, this is a bit different.

262
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Because in the MAR-experiment,

263
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the method of transmission,

264
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
because we have to pick the single colony,

265
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
so it is done on the side plate.

266
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This may be a bit different.

267
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I see.

268
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yes, so there is a possible assumption that

269
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the MAR-line has a lower mutation rate,

270
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
while the wild-type has a higher mutation rate,

271
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
which may explain this.

272
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This picture is mainly to say

273
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
that the phenomenon we just saw

274
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
is not caused by one or two lines.

275
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
If I draw the slope of each line,

276
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
you will find that they are actually quite consistent.

277
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
For example, in the MAR-line,

278
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
each block is a different parallel population.

279
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Then you will find that they are all lower than the virtual line.

280
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The virtual line is the expected rate in the MA-experiment.

281
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
In the wild-type, each one is higher.

282
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So the average phenomenon just now

283
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
is not just caused by one or two lines.

284
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It is a very broad phenomenon.

285
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Another interesting point is

286
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
if you look closely,

287
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
in the wild-type background,

288
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
the smallest is the small dilution factor.

289
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You will find that there are two or three points

290
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
where the outlier is divided into two groups.

291
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
This means that

292
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
during the evolution process,

293
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the two points at the top,

294
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the two parallel populations,

295
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
may have evolved a high mutation rate

296
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
compared to others.

297
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:06,000
In the method of measuring the mutation rate,

298
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
in addition to the MA-experiment just mentioned,

299
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
there is another method called the fluctuation test.

300
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This method will be faster

301
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
because it does not need to go through

302
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
several months of generation and cultivation.

303
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
In the end, there is no need for high-throughput sequencing.

304
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But it will be less accurate.

305
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
The principle of this fluctuation test is

306
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
if the line at the beginning

307
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
is antibiotic-sensitive,

308
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
then

309
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
if it encounters antibiotics,

310
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
these will die.

311
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like these blue and black dots.

312
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Then,

313
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
if we start cultivating

314
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
the same group of bacteria

315
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
with different tubes,

316
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
you can imagine that

317
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
they will each produce a new mutation

318
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
because they start to reproduce themselves.

319
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
In the process of reproduction,

320
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
they may get a new mutation.

321
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
In these new mutations,

322
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
some of them will cause the bacteria

323
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
to gain the ability of antibiotic resistance.

324
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
In this picture,

325
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
there are those white dots.

326
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Then,

327
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
after several generations,

328
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
after a period of reproduction,

329
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
we will put the bacteria inside

330
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
on the plate of the antibiotic cultivator

331
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
to calculate

332
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
how many colonies there are.

333
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This means

334
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
how many new individuals

335
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
have antibiotic resistance.

336
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
We can compare different bacteria.

337
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
If more colonies are found

338
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
at the end of the test,

339
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
it means that

340
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the potential mutation rate is higher.

341
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So,

342
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
the method of

343
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
measuring the mutation rate

344
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
is to use

345
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
the reprimising antibiotic

346
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to measure.

347
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Then,

348
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
we took some

349
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
clones that had just evolved

350
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
to do the experiment.

351
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Then,

352
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
we also did the

353
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
ancestor test.

354
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We also did the

355
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
ancestor mutation rate test.

356
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It is worth noting that

357
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
the mutation rate here is not the previous

358
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
per base pair per generation.

359
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It is a mutation rate

360
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
related to antibiotic resistance.

361
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
However,

362
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
we can still compare the relative changes between them.

363
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We found that in the MMR-line,

364
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
the ancestor mutation rate

365
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is actually

366
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
about 10 to the power of 6.

367
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
However,

368
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
in the Evolv-line,

369
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
we found that

370
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
the mutation rate is reduced

371
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
by about 20 to 40 times,

372
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
as shown in the figure.

373
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
However, in the wild type,

374
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
this phenomenon is not obvious.

375
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You can see that their

376
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
error bars are basically overlapped.

377
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Or,

378
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
in some cases,

379
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the mutation rate is very large.

380
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So, we think

381
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
that the wild type mutation rate

382
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
may not have much change

383
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
in these lines.

384
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The change is relatively small.

385
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
However, in the ML-line,

386
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
the mutation rate is low.

387
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
This may be

388
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
one of the explanations for the phenomenon.

389
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Of course,

390
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
this is just a few lines.

391
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We are currently measuring

392
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
more lines.

393
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Another possible factor

394
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
is the stop-population structure.

395
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The stop-population structure

396
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
is actually

397
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
what the researchers

398
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
in the Lynch Lab

399
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
found before.

400
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
They found that

401
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
if the environment of the tube

402
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
is used,

403
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
it is easy to cause

404
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
a mutation.

405
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It is a bit like

406
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
what is shown in this picture.

407
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
At first, the bacteria

408
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
may be in a plantonic state,

409
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
which means that

410
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
it can incubate inside.

411
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
However, after the mutation,

412
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
some bacteria may develop

413
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and form a biological membrane

414
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
on the surface.

415
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
In this case,

416
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it will cause

417
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
a difference in the structure of the group.

418
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Previously,

419
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
in the long-term

420
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
E. coli evolution

421
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
of Richard Lenski,

422
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
they developed

423
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
the Hidden Markov Model

424
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
to see

425
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
how the

426
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
stop-population structure

427
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
in the population

428
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
changes.

429
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
He used

430
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
the Hidden Markov Model

431
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
to assume

432
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that

433
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
different mutations

434
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
in the population

435
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
may be in different clades.

436
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He assumed that

437
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
there is a major clade

438
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
and a minor clade.

439
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The Hidden Markov Chain

440
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
assumes that

441
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
a mutation

442
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
can change

443
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
the frequency

444
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
in the basal clade,

445
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
major clade,

446
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
or minor clade

447
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
in the basal clade.

448
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
On the left,

449
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
this is a very complicated picture.

450
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
He used

451
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
the Hidden Markov Chain Model

452
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
to identify

453
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
some mutations,

454
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
as shown in the above picture,

455
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that can

456
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
successfully spread

457
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
to the entire population

458
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
by increasing

459
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
the allele frequency

460
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to 1.

461
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
However,

462
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
these mutations

463
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
may have

464
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
substructure evidence

465
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
in the population.

466
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I did the same

467
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
analysis of the

468
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Markov Chain Model.

469
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I used

470
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
the analysis

471
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to estimate

472
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
how long

473
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the two

474
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
mutations

475
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
in the basal clade

476
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and the minor clade

477
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and the major clade

478
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
can be observed.

479
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
In this picture,

480
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
there are different

481
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
population bottlenecks

482
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and different genetic backgrounds.

483
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The histogram

484
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
is the distribution

485
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
of coexistence time.

486
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
We found that

487
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
ML-

488
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
tends to

489
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
have longer

490
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
clade

491
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and

492
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
is marginally

493
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
significant.

494
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It is possible that

495
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
the ML-

496
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
bottlenecks

497
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
make the population

498
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
structure

499
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
more likely to occur,

500
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
which causes

501
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
the evolutionary rate

502
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
to be less than

503
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
the initial

504
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
ancestor mutation

505
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
of the

506
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
ML-

507
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
clade.

508
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Next,

509
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
we are going to

510
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
look at

511
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
the nature selection effect.

512
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
When we look at

513
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
the nature selection effect,

514
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
we tend to look at

515
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
different pore mutations.

516
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Different pore mutations

517
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
have different

518
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
perception of

519
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
nature selection.

520
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Different DNA

521
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
sequences

522
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
produce different

523
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
protein sequences.

524
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We call some mutations

525
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
synonymous mutations.

526
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
This means that

527
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
although the DNA sequence

528
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
changes,

529
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the protein sequence

530
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
does not change.

531
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
For example,

532
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
in this green example,

533
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
G becomes A,

534
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
but it is still glycine.

535
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Because it changes

536
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
in the first place of the codon,

537
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
the original glycine

538
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
becomes arginine.

539
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So you can imagine that

540
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
if this non-synonymous mutation

541
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
causes a change in the amino

542
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
acid sequence,

543
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
this mutation

544
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
may cause

545
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
a stronger nature selection

546
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
because it changes the protein sequence,

547
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
which will negatively affect the protein function.

548
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
In the analysis,

549
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
we only focus on

550
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
non-synonymous mutations,

551
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
which may cause

552
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
a change in the protein function.

553
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Then,

554
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
we need to detect

555
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
this parallelism mutation.

556
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The method we use is

557
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
G-score.

558
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Here is a simple example.

559
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
For example,

560
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
there are

561
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
gene A,

562
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
gene B,

563
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
gene C,

564
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and then

565
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
there are six replicates

566
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
in the experiment.

567
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Then

568
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
each gene may have

569
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
ten

570
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
non-synonymous sites.

571
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
If

572
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
this parallelism

573
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
does not favor any gene,

574
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
like the example here,

575
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
there are two, two, two.

576
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Then

577
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
we can calculate

578
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
this G-score will be zero.

579
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So when the G-score is very low,

580
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
it means

581
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
that no gene

582
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
is particularly easy to be mutated.

583
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But the following example

584
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
shows that if a certain gene

585
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
is easy to be mutated,

586
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
such as gene A,

587
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
like this example,

588
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
there are also six mutations in total,

589
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
but these six mutations

590
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
only occur in A,

591
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
but not in B and C.

592
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
If these six mutations

593
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
occur in A,

594
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
the final result

595
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
will make the G-score very high.

596
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That is to say,

597
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
the high or low G-score

598
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
can tell us

599
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
whether certain genes

600
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
are particularly easy to mutate.

601
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
There are some different

602
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
biological meanings

603
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
to explain the higher G-score

604
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
we see.

605
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
For example,

606
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
if a gene

607
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
has a relatively strong

608
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
beneficial effect,

609
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
it is easier to be retained

610
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
in the selection.

611
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Then it may show

612
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
a higher G-score.

613
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It is also possible that

614
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
there are a lot of mutations

615
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
in that gene

616
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
that have beneficial effects.

617
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But in addition to

618
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
beneficial effects

619
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
and natural selection-related results,

620
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
it is also possible

621
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
that there are different mutations

622
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
in different genome regions.

623
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Therefore,

624
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
in order to

625
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
really observe

626
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
the effect of natural selection,

627
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
we only consider

628
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
fixed mutations.

629
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The so-called fixed mutations

630
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
are those mutations

631
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
that have spread

632
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
throughout the entire group.

633
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Such mutations

634
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
are usually not just

635
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
a bias,

636
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but they can spread

637
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
within the group.

638
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Another point is

639
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
how many total

640
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
non-senitive mutations

641
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
will affect

642
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
the G-score itself.

643
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
In this picture,

644
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
if we simulate the G-score

645
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and start with some different numbers,

646
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
you will find that

647
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
the higher the number

648
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
of G-scores,

649
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
the higher the G-score itself.

650
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Therefore,

651
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
when we compare,

652
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
we can't just observe the G-score.

653
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We also need to use

654
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
how many mutations

655
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
to simulate

656
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and compare the value of observation

657
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and the value of simulation.

658
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So this picture is

659
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
the result of gene-level parallelism.

660
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
The triangle part

661
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
is the actual observed

662
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
G-score.

663
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The histogram part

664
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
is the simulation part.

665
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Based on the simulated distribution

666
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
and the observed value,

667
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
we can calculate the Z-value.

668
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The Z-value

669
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
tells us

670
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
how significant

671
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
the gene-level parallelism is.

672
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The higher the value,

673
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
the more significant it is.

674
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
In this result,

675
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
we can see that

676
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
first of all,

677
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
the MR-value

678
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
has more gene-level parallelism.

679
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It may be because

680
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
the mutation rate is higher,

681
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
so it may be able to

682
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
search for more mutations,

683
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
resulting in a stronger selection effect.

684
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
At the same time,

685
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
we can only see

686
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
if a single gene

687
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
shows a strong G-score.

688
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
This picture

689
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
is the result of

690
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
the statistical test.

691
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So we have listed

692
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
some different genes

693
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
that show

694
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
an effect on

695
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
gene-level parallelism.

696
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Then we can

697
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
analyze

698
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
the special

699
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
clustering function

700
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
of these genes.

701
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
We have obtained

702
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
several possible candidates,

703
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
such as those with special

704
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
enzyme activity

705
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
or those

706
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
related to

707
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
transcription regulation.

708
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Interestingly,

709
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
some genes

710
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
are identified

711
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
as being

712
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
gene-level parallelism.

713
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
For example,

714
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
FinH, FinE, FinB, FinG

715
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
are all related to

716
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
type I fibrillate structure

717
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
or regulation.

718
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
In E.coli,

719
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
type I fibrillate

720
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
is related to

721
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
stress response

722
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and mobility.

723
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Perhaps these genes

724
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
can help

725
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
E.coli

726
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
to grow.

727
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
After identifying

728
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
these genes,

729
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
our next goal

730
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
is to test

731
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
whether these genes

732
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
can increase

733
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
E.coli fitness.

734
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
We also detected

735
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
some nucleotide-level

736
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
parallelism.

737
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
This is

738
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
the nucleotide-level

739
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
parallelism

740
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
distribution.

741
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
X-axis

742
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
shows

743
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
how many nucleotide

744
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
mutations can be seen

745
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
in different parallel

746
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
experiments.

747
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
There are also

748
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
different population

749
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
bottleneck sizes

750
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and different genetic backgrounds.

751
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
We also found

752
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
nucleotide-level

753
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
parallelism.

754
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
In other words,

755
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
mutations

756
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
such as point mutations

757
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
can be observed

758
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
in different parallel

759
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
experiments.

760
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
These are

761
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
potential

762
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and important

763
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
adaptive mutations.

764
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
This also

765
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
provides

766
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
a target

767
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
for verification

768
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
in the next experiment.

769
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
For example,

770
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
we can make a point map

771
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
to map these nucleotides

772
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
to see if they are

773
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
really increasing

774
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
in our

775
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
experimental conditions.

776
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
In short,

777
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
we tested

778
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
many different

779
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
genetic backgrounds

780
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
and different

781
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
population bottleneck sizes.

782
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
We tried to

783
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
understand

784
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
whether the different

785
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
phenotypes

786
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
in different

787
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
genetic backgrounds

788
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
or in different

789
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
stronger bottlenecks

790
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
can also show

791
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
parallelism.

792
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Will the level of

793
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
parallelism change?

794
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The results show

795
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
that

796
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
although the

797
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
level of

798
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
parallelism

799
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
is lower than the

800
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
genetic background,

801
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
the rate of

802
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
mutation

803
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
is lower

804
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
than the genetic background.

805
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
This may be because

806
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
most mutations

807
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
are not good

808
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
for the individual.

809
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
If the

810
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
mutation rate is

811
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
high,

812
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
the

813
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
mutation rate

814
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
will be

815
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
affected

816
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
negatively

817
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
by the

818
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
genetic background.

819
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Maybe

820
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
the

821
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
effect of

822
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
the

823
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
genetic background

824
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
will make

825
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
the

826
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
mutation rate

827
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
lower.

828
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
We also found that

829
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
the MR-

830
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
line

831
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
tends to

832
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
evolve

833
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
population

834
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
substructure.

835
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
This

836
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
part of the

837
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
hypothesis

838
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
may be because

839
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the evolution

840
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
of population

841
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
substructure

842
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
may

843
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
require

844
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
different

845
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
types of

846
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
mutations

847
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
to

848
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
cause

849
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
different

850
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
mutations

851
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
in the

852
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
population.

853
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Different

854
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
mutations

855
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
in different

856
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
places

857
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
may have

858
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
different

859
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
collaborations.

860
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
For example,

861
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
in

862
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
biofilm,

863
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
some

864
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
individuals

865
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
may secrete

866
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
nutrients

867
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
that

868
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
may be

869
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
needed

870
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
by other

871
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
individuals.

872
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
If the

873
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
total mutation

874
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
rate is

875
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
higher,

876
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
different

877
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
individuals

878
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
may

879
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
have

880
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
this

881
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
collaboration

882
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
related

883
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
mutation.

884
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
However,

885
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
although

886
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
the

887
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
MR-

rate

890
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
is higher,

891
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
it

892
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
does not

893
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000

894
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
the

897
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000

898
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
A

902
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000

903
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
reduce

904
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000

In

00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
addition,

915
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
we can

916
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
also see

917
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
the

920
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
above.

921
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Whether

922
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
it is
