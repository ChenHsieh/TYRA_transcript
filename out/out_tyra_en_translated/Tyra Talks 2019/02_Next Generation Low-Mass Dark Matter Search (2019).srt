which aims to measure dark matter.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
which aims to measure dark matter.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
which aims to measured dark matter.

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
which aims to measured dark matter.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
which aims to measured dark matter.

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
which aims to measured dark matter.

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What I mean is there are 30 spectrums in this list

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There is a difference between the expected and predicted mass by GRAVITY

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There is a difference between the expected and predicted mass by GRAVITY

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,380
When it is

72
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,380
close to about the galaxy,

73
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,380
the material is able to spin faster than the prescribed velocity

74
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,380
when it is close to about the galaxy,

75
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,380
the material is able to spin faster than the prescribed velocity

76
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,580
This means when it

77
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,580
is close to the galaxy, the force is much greater than the expected force

78
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,580
when it is close to the galaxy, the force is much greater than the expected force

79
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,580
It is able to maintain the orbit faster

80
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,580
It is able to maintain the orbit faster

81
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,580
If you have any questions, just ask directly

82
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,580
Sometimes, there are some confusion

83
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,580
Is this uncertainty too blue?

84
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,580
Is this uncertainty too blue?

85
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,580
It looks like the blue line is very strong

86
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,580
The blue line indicates that it should look like this

87
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,580
The blue line indicates that it should look like this

88
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,580
The blue line indicates that it should look like this

89
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,580
And the red line indicates that it probably grows like this

90
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,580
But it says that the measurement allows to accurately measure if any location

91
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,580
But it says that the measurement allows to accurately measure if any location

92
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,580
can measure the distance between the crucible, solar system's velocity

93
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,580
can measure the distance between the crucible, solar system's velocity

94
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,580
each média indicates very low uncertainty

95
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,580
each média indicates very low uncertainty

96
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,580
each média indicates very low uncertainty

97
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,580
Okay, so this should be very accurate

98
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,580
Okay, so this should be very accurate

99
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
Okay, so we know that

100
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,580
We found out that these planets rotate

101
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,580
Can I ask a question?

102
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,580
So you mean all the black lines are pretty accurate

103
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,580
So you mean all the black lines are pretty accurate

104
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,580
The masses are not the same

105
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,580
The distribution is not the same

106
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,580
So you can imagine that there are 31 sets of blue and red lines

107
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,580
So you can imagine that there are 31 sets of blue and red lines

108
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,580
I just want to emphasize that it is getting more and more obvious when you get close to the periphery

109
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,580
It's too fast

110
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,580
It's so fast that it's weird

111
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,580
So at this time

112
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,580
You see this person called Vicky

113
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,580
He noticed this when he was observing the Small Magellanic Orbit

114
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,580
He noticed this when he was observing the Small Magellanic Orbit

115
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,580
So he is the first to propose this

116
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,580
So there is actually a blue light cloud

117
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,580
So there is actually a blue light cloud

118
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,580
I draw it up to tell you that there is something there

119
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,580
But in fact you can't see the blue light

120
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,580
There is a black hole, a light cloud

121
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Dark matter

122
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,580
It is a mass

123
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,580
It is also radiating gravity

124
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,580
It is also radiating gravity

125
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,580
These things are symmetrical

126
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,580
Many people did not believe it until it was proposed

127
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Many people did not believe it until it was proposed

128
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,580
Vera Rubin did a very careful measurement

129
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,580
For many galaxies

130
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,580
This is a typical example

131
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,580
We can observe what we see

132
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,580
Its behavior

133
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,580
How much gravity affects it

134
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,580
Then we can see what can radiate gravity

135
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
How much can we really see

136
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,580
Then we compare the difference

137
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Then we find that there is a part of the mass that we can't see

138
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,580
This is easier to understand

139
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,580
But in fact, dark matter has a lot of

140
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,580
There are a lot of different scales

141
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,580
It can be attributed to dark matter

142
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,580
It can be attributed to dark matter

143
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,580
What you see in the upper left corner

144
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Is the rotation curve

145
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Second, what you see in the upper right corner

146
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,580
All the light spots are a galaxy cluster

147
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,580
All the light spots are a galaxy cluster

148
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,580
In other words, that a light spot

149
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,580
There are so many galaxies

150
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,580
It looks like a big universe

151
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,580
It looks like a big universe

152
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,580
This is a simulation

153
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,580
The black part is dark matter

154
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,580
It makes the background of the universe white

155
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,580
If there is no dark matter in the universe

156
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,580
In this simulation

157
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,580
There is no way to form enough gravity to attract the matter

158
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,580
It is not heavy enough

159
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,580
It is not heavy enough

160
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,580
So there are a lot of dark matter

161
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,580
It is closer to the cosmic web

162
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,580
It is closer to the cosmic web

163
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Then the gravity will quickly suck in the visible matter

164
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,580
So dark matter can be explained well

165
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,580
If you look at the lower left corner

166
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,580
First, I want to say that the blue light cloud and the red light cloud in the lower left corner are added

167
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,580
The blue light cloud and the red light cloud in the lower left corner are added

168
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,580
There are not seen

169
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,580
Do you see the red part?

170
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,300
It means that it has observed X-ray emission

171
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Do you see the blue part?

172
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,440
It means that it has observed X-ray emission

173
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,340
It is under the effect of limited sunlight

174
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,340
It is under the effect of limited sunlight

175
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,460
The equivalent effect of GANS

176
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,480
It is the opposite of GANS

177
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,440
The blue parts on two sides are soaked with GANS

178
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,460
The red parts are soaked with X-ray emission

179
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,380
The red parts are soaked with X-ray emission

180
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,240
In this graph, the two galaxy clusters clash

181
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,060
In this graph, the two galaxy clusters clash

182
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,860
When they clash, the 2 clusters pass

183
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,520
We know that when these clusters collide

184
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,500
The closest cluster will generate X-ray

185
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,760
The closest cluster will generate X-ray

186
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,820
They look like two sprays of water

187
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,820
They look like two sprays of water

188
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,720
But there are two masses

189
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
But there are two masses

190
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,720
They run far away

191
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,220
They don't interact

192
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,680
They don't interact with the matter we know

193
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,180
They don't interact with the matter we know

194
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,680
This is called a Bully Cluster

195
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,040
This can also give a very strong constraint

196
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,140
It is massive and it doesn't work

197
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,140
In the lower left corner

198
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,840
In the lower left corner

199
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,220
We can see the light blue and green

200
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,220
We can see the light blue and green

201
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,220
This is our galaxy

202
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,220
If we observe from the earth

203
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,220
This is the background of the universe

204
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,220
This is the background of the universe

205
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,220
The red part is hot, the blue part is cold

206
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
This is the radiation of the universe

207
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
The red part is hot, the blue part is cold

208
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
If I make this galaxy

209
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
If I make this galaxy

210
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
2D Fourier Transform

211
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
You can see the shape of the light bulb

212
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,400
You can see the shape of the light bulb

213
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
90 degrees, 18 degrees, 1 degree

214
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,400
90 degrees, 18 degrees, 1 degree

215
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
0.2, 0.1, 0.07

216
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,580
What is the axis of gravity

217
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Correlation

218
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,580
The heat is directly related between the two points

219
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,580
The heat is directly related between the two points

220
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,580
The heat is directly related between the two points

221
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,580
The chance is basically this

222
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,580
In other words, this blue and green

223
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,580
In other words, this blue and green

224
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,580
At about 1 degree

225
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,580
Or 0.7 degrees or 0.5 degrees

226
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Or 0.7 degrees or 0.5 degrees

227
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,580
So its density will mainly appear at these angles

228
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,580
So its density will mainly appear at these angles

229
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,580
This is very interesting

230
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,580
We first have to ask how the universe's background radiation is produced

231
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,580
The background radiation of the universe is in the very distant early universe

232
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,580
The background radiation of the universe is in the very distant early universe

233
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,580
When these lights are no longer with the very chaotic matter in the universe

234
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,580
When these lights are no longer with the very chaotic matter in the universe

235
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,580
After the Big Bang

236
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,580
It recorded the temperature of that location

237
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,580
What is the temperature

238
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,580
Temperature is the density of the location

239
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,580
Because the higher the density, the greater the pressure

240
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,580
The higher the temperature, the more heat, the more radiation

241
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,580
So we observe the distribution of the CMB map

242
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,580
So we observe the distribution of the CMB map

243
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,580
How is the quality distributed in the universe

244
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,580
How is the quality distributed in the universe

245
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,580
We can find one thing from this

246
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,580
To be so closely distributed

247
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,580
Like you see this spectrum

248
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,580
If only the quality in the universe we see now is not enough

249
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,580
If only the quality in the universe we see now is not enough

250
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,580
We need more quality

251
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,580
They will first be crowded together because of gravity

252
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,580
They will first be crowded together because of gravity

253
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Then their gravity will help lighter matter

254
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,580
Then their gravity will help lighter matter

255
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,580
It's like a right-hand corner map

256
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,580
It's like a right-hand corner map

257
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,580
The story is very similar

258
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,580
If only the matter we see is not heavy enough

259
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,580
To form the CMB map

260
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,580
To form the CMB map

261
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,580
Here we can tell us

262
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
There are many observations in the universe

263
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,580
There are many observations in the universe

264
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,580
The observed matter physics is basically particle physics

265
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,580
It's not consistent with gravity

266
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,580
It's not consistent with gravity

267
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,580
A good direction is to think

268
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Some things in our model have mass

269
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
Some things in our model have mass

270
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,580
We can explain it

271
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,580
This is dark matter

272
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,580
I will stop here

273
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,580
Do you have any questions?

274
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,580
It will be more technical

275
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,580
It will be more technical

276
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Do you have any questions?

277
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,580
You can ask a difficult question

278
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,580
I want to ask a simple question

279
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,580
I want to ask a simple question

280
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,580
I want to ask a simple question

281
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Do you know about the Fermi Law?

282
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,580
Do you know about the Fermi Law?

283
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Do you know about the Fermi Law?

284
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Want to know about Fermi Law?

285
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,580
Want to know about Fermi Law?

286
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Want to know about Fermi Law?

287
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,580
want to know about Fermi Law?

288
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,580
Questions

289
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,580
Because some galaxies are large

290
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Because some galaxies are large

291
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Because some galaxies are large

292
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Because some galaxies are large

293
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,580
Because some galaxies are large

294
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Because some galaxies are large

295
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Because some galaxies are large

296
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Because some galaxies are large

297
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,580
It's curious, isn't this my job?

298
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,580
Isn't this my job?

299
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
Can you hear me?

300
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,580
Let me ask

301
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Regarding the explanation

302
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,580
Because there is dark matter

303
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,580
It has weight but it can't be seen or observed

304
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,580
It's just an explanation

305
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Is there any other explanation?

306
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,580
Try to explain this matter

307
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,580
And I'm very interested

308
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,580
But first, it's hard to do experiments in a short time

309
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
So I'm not doing it now

310
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
But I've been thinking

311
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,580
I told you that gravity is not wrong

312
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
It's just that there are some matters you can't see

313
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,580
The other best explanation is that gravity is wrong

314
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Is this okay?

315
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Yes, gravity is wrong

316
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
The answer is this

317
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
Why is gravity wrong is interesting

318
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Because we always know

319
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,580
Quantum mechanics works very well

320
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,580
It can explain almost everything we see

321
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Even if it can't explain

322
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
It can also be based on quantum mechanics

323
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Give you a good model

324
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
Except for one thing, we have no idea

325
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Is gravity

326
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
We can't quantize it

327
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Then quantize can normalize

328
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
It becomes a good theory

329
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
So many people always think

330
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Another good explanation is dark matter

331
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,580
Is a good example

332
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,580
Some very important and we don't know

333
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,580
In these places

334
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,580
It will be with the traditional gravity we know

335
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,580
Or quantum mechanics is incompatible

336
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,580
Of course, there are many ways to explain

337
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,580
We can talk about it later

338
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
But basically this is my answer

339
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
Gravity may be wrong

340
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,580
This is also a direction

341
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,580
Because I actually

342
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,580
Stay in high school and university physics

343
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,580
Let me feel like

344
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,580
Maybe it sounds like etheric

345
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
A little hypothetical

346
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,580
This is just a model

347
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
I agree

348
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,580
Thank you

349
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Let's start talking about technical things

350
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
First of all, what you see here

351
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Is what we know so far

352
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Dark matter

353
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Should say

354
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
On the table

355
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Dark matter model

356
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,580
You see the lightest

357
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
That z is 10-

358
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
369 12 15

359
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
21 24

360
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
Small z is 10-24

361
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,580
Square EV

362
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,580
This is the quality unit

363
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
If you are not familiar with EV

364
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
EV is the weight of the electron

365
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
So it's so light

366
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,580
10-24 square electron weight

367
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
The heaviest

368
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,580
Can be so heavy

369
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
He can't use EV

370
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
He is 30 solar weight on the right

371
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
But we usually don't talk about

372
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
PEV

373
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
10-15 square electron weight

374
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,580
Obviously we don't understand this problem

375
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Don't understand

376
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
We can build up

377
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,580
If you can imagine

378
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
These things in the range

379
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
May be a good model

380
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
And not ruled out

381
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
But the most important thing

382
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
You can see that there are two groups

383
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
A group on the right

384
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
WIMP

385
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Hidden Sector Dark Matter

386
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Hidden Thermal Relic

387
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Asymmetric Dark Matter

388
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Freezing Dark Matter

389
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
SIMP

390
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,580
On the left

391
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Exia

392
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Ultralight

393
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
What is the main difference

394
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
The main difference is

395
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
The heavier one

396
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,580
It will calm down

397
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
You can imagine

398
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,580
In the process of cooling

399
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
It will cool down

400
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
Stop at a point

401
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
Like a dot

402
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,580
In our galaxy

403
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
Like a planet

404
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,580
Rotate like a dust

405
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
Ultralight on the right

406
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
Is the best name

407
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
It's so light

408
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Its material wave is very long

409
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
So long

410
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
It may be as big as a galaxy

411
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,580
So you can't define

412
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
It is a point like

413
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Particle or wave

414
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
Or matter wave

415
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
So it has a very strong

416
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
Coherence interaction

417
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Of course

418
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
In other words, it will not cool down

419
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,580
OK

420
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
But the point we want to talk about today

421
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
Is these particle-like

422
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
Instead of wave-like

423
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
So we will focus on today

424
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
This orange part

425
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
This orange part

426
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
Is the so-called thermal relic

427
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
For thermal relic

428
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
Experts don't need me to explain

429
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
According to my explanation

430
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
In the process of cosmic cooling

431
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,580
It will cool down

432
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Localize

433
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,580
Point-like

434
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Then of course

435
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,580
According to our observations on astronomy

436
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,580
We can have some

437
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,580
Restrictions

438
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,580
These particles can't be less than

439
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
Can't be more than

440
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,580
Hundreds of T.E.V.

441
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,580
This is the range

442
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
OK

443
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
The next page is

444
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
How do we measure

445
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,580
What you see here is a

446
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,580
It's like a Feynman diagram

447
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,580
It's not a Feynman diagram

448
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
In other words, this chi or this big X

449
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Is the dark matter

450
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Dark matter

451
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
Dark matter

452
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
If they interact

453
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
They can produce two

454
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
Standard model

455
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,580
We already know the particle

456
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
Then they may shoot out

457
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
For example, Neutrino, Gamma ray, X-ray

458
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,580
Or Lepton

459
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,580
Or even proton

460
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,580
Then you can use some

461
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,580
Measurement of cosmic radiation

462
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,580
If something like this happens somewhere in the universe

463
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
It may shoot out to the earth

464
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,580
The particle we can measure

465
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,580
For example, Anitta, IceCube, AMS, Fermi

466
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,580
OK

467
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,580
If you look at the top of this picture

468
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,580
Collider is basically the opposite

469
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,580
You take the Standard Model Particle

470
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,580
With another Standard Model Particle

471
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,580
Then put it together

472
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,580
Then hope this one

473
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Matter energy will become

474
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,580
What is that called

475
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,580
Dark matter comes out

476
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Then I put a quotation here

477
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
If both come out as dark matter, you're done

478
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,580
You can't see anything

479
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,580
But in Collider, if it comes out as dark matter

480
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
The other one is not dark matter

481
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,580
Then you have to go through another behavior

482
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
To understand what that part is

483
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Then this is probably what Collider is doing

484
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,580
What is LHC, Bell

485
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,580
Or even there are many experiments

486
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,580
It is Accelerator

487
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,580
It may not be Collider

488
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
It may be to take this beam and hit a target

489
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Then hope that target can shoot something

490
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,580
That is also the concept

491
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,580
OK, today our focus is

492
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,580
Direct Detection

493
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,580
Direct Detection is this picture

494
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Look up or look down

495
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
What does this mean

496
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,580
That is to say

497
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,580
Standard Model Particle

498
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,580
On the earth

499
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,580
We use it as a detector

500
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,580
Then there is a dark matter

501
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,580
Hit it

502
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,580
Then it bounced away

503
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,580
Then this time it was hit

504
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,580
Proton or Neutron or Electron

505
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,580
We use it as a detector

506
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Will move, basically like this

507
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,580
It moves like a baseball

508
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Then we measure this dynamic

509
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
Its concept is basically like this

510
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,580
The more famous one is

511
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,580
Liquid Noble Gas

512
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,580
Liquid Noble

513
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,580
It is a doping element

514
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,580
Turn it into a liquid

515
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Or you can use Solid State

516
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,580
For example, semiconductor, superconductor, etc.

517
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
Then there are some people who use Cavity

518
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,580
But Cavity is usually not Thermal

519
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,580
So I won't talk about it today

520
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Next page

521
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,580
Then we will focus on

522
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
So what is Direct Detection

523
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
You can see the picture on the right

524
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Can I ask a question

525
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,580
You say

526
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,580
So

527
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,580
From the beginning

528
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
Everyone speculates that there is dark matter

529
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,580
This matter

530
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
It sounds like

531
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
Assuming

532
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
This gravity is right

533
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,580
Then

534
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
So I guess he must have

535
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,580
Some dark matter that I can't observe

536
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
So

537
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Is it possible

538
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Uh

539
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
In the last page

540
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Those observations

541
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
Direct or indirect observation

542
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
The way of dark matter

543
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,580
I must

544
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
Is

545
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Every way

546
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
Must rely on

547
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
The relationship above

548
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
To speculate the existence of dark matter

549
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Ok

550
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
This is what I want to say first

551
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
What we are doing

552
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Is hope

553
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,580
Except for this

554
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
We can really see

555
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
It's like a particle

556
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
Interaction

557
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Instead of

558
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Pure gravity

559
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
But the answer is

560
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,580
You are right

561
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
So far all the phenomena we have seen are

562
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
Only gravity

563
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,580
No one else

564
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,580
Why is it important

565
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,580
Other interactions

566
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Understanding or restricting

567
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Uh this model is very important

568
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
Important thing

569
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,580
Then I just said something wrong

570
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
That

571
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
I made a very stupid mistake

572
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
That is, the electronic quality is half MEV

573
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Not half EV

574
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
Did I say EV?

575
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Anyway, the electronic quality is MEV

576
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Everyone will see

577
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
This quality is important

578
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Ok, let's go back to the current projection

579
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
I have a question

580
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
I want to ask

581
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,580
Does anyone predict

582
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
How much is the distribution of dark matter

583
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,580
How is it

584
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,580
It is a

585
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,580
Now is

586
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,580
I can't imagine

587
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
It is

588
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Dark matter is a

589
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Particle

590
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,580
Such a thing exists

591
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Then every particle

592
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
Has a certain quality

593
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Or say

594
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Any other way

595
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
To judge this dark matter

596
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Is a group of things

597
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,580
That group of things

598
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
Various groups

599
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
A group of groups

600
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
Then each group does not necessarily have the same quality

601
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Like this

602
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
Because now you look at your spectrum

603
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,580
It looks like a lot less

604
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,580
But it doesn't seem to say

605
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,580
If I have any

606
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,580
Prediction

607
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Then it will be

608
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
A group of basic examples

609
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,580
Or is it a

610
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Any group of quality

611
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,580
Any energy

612
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Ok

613
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
The answer is we don't know

614
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,580
I can only tell you

615
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,580
Now the general assumption is

616
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,580
We measure the signal

617
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
Then we

618
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
Convert this signal to

619
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
Interaction

620
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,580
When these parameters

621
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,580
You now see the upper right corner

622
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
This picture

623
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,580
Dark matter

624
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
There is only one dark matter

625
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
Then the quality of the particle

626
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
That's the quality

627
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
This is the assumption

628
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
In many models

629
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
Dark matter can have more than one

630
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,580
Since there is more than one dark matter

631
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
Its quality will not be only one

632
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,580
So how it decays

633
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
Or how it interacts

634
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Its scenario

635
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,580
But in order to be able to compare each other

636
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
Data

637
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
On the same basis

638
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
So now we usually assume

639
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Dark matter has only one

640
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
Then we don't care what it is

641
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
We only care about its quality

642
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Ok

643
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,580
Got it

644
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
Ok, let's go back to this page

645
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
In fact, I just told you a lot about this page

646
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
So how do we do it

647
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
In this galaxy

648
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
We built a detector on the earth

649
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
Then our solar system

650
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Rotates inside

651
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
So we keep bumping into this

652
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Our Milky Way

653
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Dark matter

654
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
So it keeps changing

655
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,580
In other words, we are on the earth

656
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,580
With us as the coordinate

657
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Is it okay?

658
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
This is our

659
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,580
If you are from this

660
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,580
Accelerator

661
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
This is our

662
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Ok

663
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
You can see that there are three pictures below

664
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Is dark matter

665
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Dark matter

666
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
Sorry

667
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,580
With our

668
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,580
Normal matter

669
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Neutron, proton, electron

670
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,580
Then run away like hitting a ball

671
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
This is the first

672
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
Its momentum transfer

673
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Energy transfer

674
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
It's very simple

675
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,580
You just need to know how heavy the two balls are

676
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Energy momentum conservation

677
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
The second one is more interesting

678
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
The second one is the picture in the middle

679
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,580
How to do it

680
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
If today

681
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
If there is a

682
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,580
Dark matter

683
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,580
With normal

684
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
We already know the matter

685
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,580
They will exchange each other

686
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
As long as they can

687
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
As long as they can

688
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,580
They have each other

689
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
This quantum number

690
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Anyway, as long as they can

691
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
Conserve some property

692
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
They can walk around

693
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
Become another

694
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
What is hope

695
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
It becomes

696
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
Normal matter

697
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Then we can measure it

698
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
The example you see below is

699
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
If today there is a dark matter like boson

700
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
Dark matter

701
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,580
It may have a certain chance to convert

702
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
The boson we know

703
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Here is an example

704
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,580
Gamma

705
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Gamma is the same as the electron

706
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
We can measure this

707
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Photon out of nowhere

708
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
This is a dark matter signal

709
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
The third one

710
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
If dark matter

711
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Is this A

712
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
If it comes in

713
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
This dark matter

714
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,580
It will decay itself

715
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
Two light

716
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
If your model

717
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Usually we will find

718
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
You can have a process

719
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
If you help it

720
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
Supply another light

721
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,580
You see this B

722
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
It's usually a very strong magnetic field

723
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
You are crazy

724
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Force it

725
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
I give you a foot

726
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
You go to another foot

727
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
So you can supply it

728
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
This magnetic field

729
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
It came in and measured the light

730
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
This is also a way

731
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
If you have this

732
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
You can do it

733
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
We are not a single channel search

734
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
We don't decide a channel

735
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
How it will decay

736
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
We put our detector

737
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Then dark matter

738
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,580
We don't know what it is

739
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
But we know it continues to hit our detector

740
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
Then we see the signal

741
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
We go again

742
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
If it is this model

743
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
What would it be

744
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
So basically we are a bunch of models

745
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
Then interpret

746
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,580
What does it mean

747
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
What you see now

748
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Is a very typical

749
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Experimental results

750
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
That is to say

751
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,580
If I assume today

752
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,580
We want to look at dark matter

753
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580
Nucleic acid

754
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,580
The contrast

755
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
What you see

756
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
Is the probability of action

757
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,580
You see down

758
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
The probability is getting smaller

759
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,580
What about the horizontal

760
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
Is this dark matter

761
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
How do I read

762
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580
You assume a mass

763
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
For example, ETEV

764
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,580
Then you look up

765
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Then see a certain line

766
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
Means

767
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
A conclusion

768
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,580
It's not right above this line

769
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
Why

770
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
Because if the quality of dark matter

771
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,580
Is this ETEV

772
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Then the probability of action

773
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Will be greater than 10 to the negative 44

774
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Then I should have

775
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,580
In the size of my detector

776
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,580
And measuring time

777
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
See a lot of signals

778
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
But I didn't see anything

779
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
So at the level of confidence

780
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
I can say that it will never be greater than this value

781
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
Then I can assume that dark matter is a lot of different qualities

782
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I can draw a line

783
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Is the line you see

784
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Is there a problem with this

785
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
It's okay

786
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
So basically

787
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,580
There are many lines

788
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
Each line is a different experiment

789
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,580
But

790
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Every line

791
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
The gray dotted line

792
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,580
And then there is a grid

793
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,580
What does that mean

794
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
That's the sun

795
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
The sun is not always acting on this

796
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
This effect

797
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
We can't avoid

798
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,580
As long as we look at the sun

799
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
This is the sun's

800
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Radiation

801
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
That

802
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
When your detector

803
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,580
I want to ask a question

804
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,580
That is to say, each line represents

805
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,580
Every experiment

806
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
It has a lot of models

807
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
Every experiment

808
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
It basically covers the model

809
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,580
No, this is usually one experiment

810
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,580
One model

811
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,580
Usually the data from the same experiment

812
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Use different models to interpret

813
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
OK

814
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
Right

815
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,580
Anyway

816
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Wait a minute

817
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,580
I'll answer the question first

818
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
What is the gray line

819
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,580
That gray line is when your experiment

820
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
When you get there

821
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
You will start to see the sun

822
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,580
Neutrino

823
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
And under the gradient

824
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,580
Under the gradient

825
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,580
You can't tell the difference between dark matter and neutrino

826
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
So you just

827
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
Basically

828
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,580
So that means

829
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
In this picture

830
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,580
When you put the rest

831
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
No white space

832
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
It means we

833
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,580
It's not possible to use

834
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
The method to detect

835
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
Unless you can distinguish

836
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Neutrino and dark matter

837
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,580
The difference in signal

838
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
Otherwise you can't see it anymore

839
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
Yeah

840
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
OK

841
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
Any other questions

842
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I have a question

843
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
I just don't understand

844
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
Is this line

845
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
Why is there a

846
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
Optimal

847
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
The mass

848
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
OK

849
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
I'll talk about this

850
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Most of the lines are now

851
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
For example

852
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
Between 10-2 and 10-1

853
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
There is a

854
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
The deepest place

855
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
Why is it so deep

856
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
I'll talk about this later

857
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
OK

858
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
Sorry

859
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
I want to ask this

860
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
Is this a model-dependent

861
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
Search

862
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
Or is it a general search

863
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Is it a model-dependent

864
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Search or general search

865
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Uh

866
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
In our field

867
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Usually this picture

868
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
Model-independent

869
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Search

870
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Dark matter

871
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
With your nucleon

872
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
Elastic scattering

873
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,580
But

874
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Literally

875
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
You still have some models

876
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
With nucleon

877
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Elastic scattering

878
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,580
But

879
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,580
But this

880
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
So this picture is

881
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
Elastic scattering

882
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
And he has to assume one more thing

883
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Dark matter has nothing to do with spin

884
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
If it has something to do with spin

885
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,580
You have to reduce the number of neutrons and neutrons

886
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Because they will cancel

887
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
So that's a model

888
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
So to some extent this is not

889
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
Model-independent in text

890
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
But this thing is called model-independent

891
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
Because it is the widest

892
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
You can cover a lot of models

893
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
OK

894
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
Next page

895
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,580
If you put this here

896
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,580
This one is called limit plot

897
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
This range, take a look at it

898
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
What quality range

899
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
Throw it back to the model I just saw

900
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
You see it only digs that one

901
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
Little piece is called classical

902
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
WIMP

903
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
If you are doing high-performance, you will know

904
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
These things are all dug in

905
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
Weak scale

906
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
10 hundred times of weak scale

907
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
What is it

908
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
100

909
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
100 GeV to a few GeV

910
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
But this range

911
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
It's very wide

912
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
All these experiments are dug here

913
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Sorry

914
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
What we want to do is ask a question

915
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
What about the other parts

916
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
What do we do

917
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
OK

918
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
So if you see this page now

919
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
I reduced the whole picture

920
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,580
Reduced to

921
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
This picture you see

922
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
Only the right side of this small piece

923
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580
The gray part is where they are now

924
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,580
Digged

925
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
Then

926
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
The whole white one next to it

927
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,580
I didn't dig it all

928
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
Then I drew a lot on it

929
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Various models

930
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
You can see it right away

931
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
The experiment they are digging

932
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
It's about 10 GeV to a few TeV

933
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Basically they are very

934
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
Focus on this

935
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
Supersymmetric theory

936
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,580
MSSM

937
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
MSSM

938
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,580
Then according to different adjustments

939
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
Its parameters

940
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
It can slightly adjust its range

941
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,580
But basically they are all digging

942
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
These things

943
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,580
But in fact, there are a lot of dark matter models

944
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
You can see

945
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
For example

946
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
10 to 5 GeV

947
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,580
There are still very good models here

948
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
And it should

949
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
So it should be Thermorelic

950
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
What we want to ask is

951
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
What about these models

952
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
You can see it now

953
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
I showed it

954
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
That is

955
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
What you see now

956
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
I zoom in to these

957
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
Places that have not been dug

958
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
The actual line is already dug

959
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
The actual line you can see

960
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
It's all CDMS

961
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
So I said CDMS is Low Mass Dark Matter Search

962
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
Very important and

963
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,580
It's basically a world-leading sensitivity

964
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,580
Experiment

965
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
If you see the long

966
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
This virtual line

967
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Is already doing

968
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Then probably in a few years

969
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,580
The result will come out

970
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Simulation expected results

971
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
The best thing to see

972
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
It should still be SNOLAB

973
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
Except for this NewsG

974
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
NewsG is quite above

975
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
But its MassReach can reach

976
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
Is 100 MeV

977
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Then if you see that dot line

978
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Dot line is that everyone has some concepts

979
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Then they use some

980
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
Basic physical way

981
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
To estimate the reach of these concepts

982
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
So there are actually a lot of people

983
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
Thinking about this

984
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,580
But this thing is also

985
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,580
WIMP Search

986
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
Continuous

987
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
LHC

988
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Effective machine

989
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
This community

990
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
This high-performance community is thinking

991
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
If not WIMP

992
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
Not SUSY

993
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
How to do

994
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,580
I will talk about

995
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,580
How did these lines come

996
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,580
I will be very fast

997
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,580
Skip a big part

998
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,580
Because I talked about it for a long time

999
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Recap

1000
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,580
So what is Elastic Scattering

1001
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Basically what you see now

1002
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Dark Matter comes in and hits your detector

1003
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,580
Then you can measure Recoil Energy

1004
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,580
Next is to answer

1005
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
The question just asked

1006
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,580
What is Elastic Scattering

1007
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
It is basically a momentum transfer

1008
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,580
You learned it when you were at PuWu

1009
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
How much energy has passed

1010
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
It's four times the energy

1011
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
Then multiply

1012
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
This two

1013
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Hit and hit

1014
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,580
The quality of these two particles is not even

1015
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
If one is very heavy, one is very light

1016
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Hit down

1017
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
The quality and energy will not pass

1018
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
When will it pass the most

1019
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,580
In these two hits and hits

1020
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,580
When their quality is the same

1021
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,580
100% will pass

1022
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,580
This also answers the question

1023
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,580
Why everyone digs

1024
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,580
Optimal point

1025
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,580
Because it is used to build

1026
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,580
The particle of the detector

1027
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,580
It's almost in that position

1028
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,580
It's so heavy

1029
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,580
It is the most sensitive

1030
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,580
Is this okay

1031
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,580
Everyone can see

1032
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,580
If my model today

1033
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,580
My particle is probably GEV

1034
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,580
Nucleon

1035
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,580
These boxes are probably GEV

1036
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
More than 900

1037
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
About 1000

1038
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,580
In the position of the earth

1039
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Gravity

1040
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,580
The speed of rotation of all particles

1041
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
About 300 km per second

1042
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,580
Put the number in

1043
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,580
You will see the energy

1044
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,580
Probably

1045
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,580
An X-ray energy

1046
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,580
Just a few tens of keV

1047
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
But if

1048
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,580
Today you put your

1049
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Model from this box

1050
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
Change to electronic

1051
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,580
It's very, very light

1052
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,580
At this time

1053
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,580
You get the maximum

1054
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,580
Momentum transfer

1055
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,580
Will come from

1056
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
A very light particle

1057
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,580
Let's imagine today

1058
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,580
The quality of the electronic is probably MEV scale

1059
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,580
Half MEV scale

1060
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,580
If you hit your particle at this time

1061
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
It's also half MEV or MEV

1062
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,580
At this time you put the number in

1063
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
Your maximum energy detection

1064
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
It can be from about 0.1 to

1065
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,580
100 EV so much energy

1066
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
It's probably less than sub keV

1067
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,580
Then even

1068
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
You have the mismatch of the mass

1069
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
The dark matter you came in is

1070
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,580
100 MEV

1071
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Sorry

1072
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,580
Compare this energy

1073
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,580
If you today

1074
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
There is a 100 MEV

1075
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
Mass

1076
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,580
The dark matter hit your nuclear

1077
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
It's GEV

1078
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
You can probably see

1079
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
Sub to 1 keV

1080
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
This kind of energy

1081
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,580
So if we can use

1082
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
This method and then measure such a small energy

1083
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
We can start to measure very light particles

1084
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
But if we go back to that page

1085
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,580
If you have a dark matter as heavy as electronic

1086
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
To hit your nuclear

1087
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
It will leave us one thousandth of the energy

1088
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,580
It's basically very difficult to measure

1089
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,580
What do you mean by Coherent?

1090
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,580
What do you mean by Coherent?

1091
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
First of all, I want to explain what Coherent is

1092
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,580
Coherent is

1093
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,580
If you have dark matter today

1094
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,580
The size of its wave packet

1095
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
Probably

1096
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
It's not the size of a nuclear

1097
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,580
But the size of your entire atomic nucleus

1098
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,580
The energy it hits

1099
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,580
Coherent is smaller than

1100
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,580
Nuclear binding energy scale

1101
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,580
It's more like hitting the entire atomic nucleus

1102
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,580
It's a hit on the entire atomic nucleus

1103
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,580
All the nuclei

1104
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,580
So the rate of this hit

1105
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,580
You pick up this signal

1106
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,580
The chance is with

1107
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,580
How many atomic nuclei

1108
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,580
The nucleus becomes positive

1109
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,580
The wave amplitude becomes positive

1110
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,580
So the probability is positive square

1111
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,580
So the hit event rate

1112
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,580
How many atomic nuclei

1113
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,580
How many nuclei become positive square

1114
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,580
But if it's electronic today

1115
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,580
Because

1116
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,580
Unless you can have an electronic

1117
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,580
Bound state

1118
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,580
Otherwise free electron

1119
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,580
Or bound to

1120
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,580
These electrons are far away

1121
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,580
So you basically only hit one at a time

1122
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,580
So there is no Coherent

1123
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,580
Addition effect

1124
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,580
OK?

1125
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,580
Continue

1126
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,580
As I said

1127
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,580
If dark matter becomes photon

1128
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,580
It will be absorbed by charged particles

1129
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,580
So how much energy it absorbs

1130
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,580
How much total energy

1131
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,580
So recap

1132
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,580
Low mass search

1133
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,580
Basically called a few GeV

1134
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,580
Or lighter

1135
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Basically you want to see very little energy

1136
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,580
So you want your

1137
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,580
Detector

1138
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,580
Energy threshold

1139
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,580
Very low

1140
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,580
You can start to see very little energy

1141
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,580
If you just go back to the picture

1142
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,580
It has a deepest place

1143
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,580
That place is usually marked

1144
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,580
Its maximum energy transfer

1145
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,580
But

1146
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,580
Towards a smaller energy or lighter mass

1147
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,580
Sensitivity

1148
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,580
Suddenly shot very high and then there is no line

1149
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,580
Because their energy threshold

1150
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,580
Detector's trigger threshold is there

1151
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,580
They can't shoot any smaller

1152
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,580
So there is a very important idea

1153
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,580
You have to have a very low

1154
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,580
Threshold to measure very light particles

1155
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,580
OK

1156
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,580
Of course I just told you

1157
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,580
There are a lot of new models

1158
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,580
Dark sector, Asymmetric DM, Freezing DM

1159
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,580
Blah blah blah

1160
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,580
But how do we do this

1161
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,580
Detector

1162
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,580
Let me recap

1163
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,580
We want to maximize

1164
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
Momentum transfer

1165
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,580
So if you want to measure light particles

1166
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,580
The picture here

1167
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,580
Asymmetric

1168
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,580
Dark matter

1169
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,580
Sorry

1170
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,580
Blah blah blah

1171
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,580
Dark matter mass

1172
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,580
Asymmetric

1173
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,580
Energy transfer, Momentum transfer

1174
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,580
You see all kinds of different elements

1175
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,580
Its peak

1176
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,580
Different places

1177
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,580
The lighter the element, the peak

1178
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,580
You can probe lighter mass

1179
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,580
Does this make sense

1180
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,580
Electron recoil

1181
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
It's the lightest

1182
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
OK

1183
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Of course, in addition to this

1184
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,580
You have to maximize energy transfer

1185
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
You have to have very low noise

1186
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,580
You have to have a very high signal-to-noise ratio

1187
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,580
To be able to measure such a small energy

1188
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,580
So you have to have sub-KEV sensitivity

1189
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,580
Then if you want

1190
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,580
Can measure

1191
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,580
You have to have very, very good ability to

1192
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,580
Shoot limit or you have to be able to see

1193
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,580
Interaction probability

1194
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,580
Or cross-section is very small

1195
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,580
Then your

1196
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Fake event background event rate

1197
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,580
Very, very low

1198
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,580
OK, here I will quickly

1199
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,580
Skip because I actually want to talk about the third part

1200
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,580
Super CDMS

1201
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,580
So what are we doing now

1202
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,580
Sorry

1203
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,580
I'll go back to that side

1204
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,580
Is there a problem

1205
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,580
No problem

1206
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,580
Can you hear me

1207
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,580
You said

1208
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,580
In fact, my physics is probably only high school physics

1209
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
But it sounds like

1210
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,580
You assume

1211
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,580
Dark matter particles

1212
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,580
With normal matter particles

1213
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,580
There are all kinds of different models

1214
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,580
Then energy will be generated

1215
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,580
So you measure this energy

1216
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,580
Then learn that this

1217
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,580
Dark matter

1218
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,580
How much is the mass

1219
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,580
Is that right

1220
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,580
In this case

1221
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,580
Suppose you do the experiment today

1222
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,580
Then measured the energy

1223
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,580
But this does not mean

1224
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,580
That your assumption model is correct

1225
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,580
Yes, you are right

1226
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,580
So this situation

1227
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,580
But this situation

1228
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,580
Should still be able to get at least

1229
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
Conclusion that dark matter does exist

1230
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,580
So this experiment

1231
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,580
The point is

1232
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,580
Is to prove the existence of dark matter

1233
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,580
Is this

1234
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,580
I

1235
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,580
The first is to prove the existence of dark matter

1236
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,580
This is the most important

1237
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,580
The second is basically

1238
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,580
Under the same logic

1239
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,580
What we are doing now

1240
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,580
Basically no one sees dark matter

1241
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,580
So we can keep

1242
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,580
Some models propose

1243
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,580
You should see dark matter here

1244
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,580
You should see this sensitivity

1245
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,580
You can't see it, we can remove them all

1246
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,580
So we are actually

1247
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,580
Narrow down the possible parameter space

1248
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,580
Oh

1249
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,580
Now the logic is basically like this

1250
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,580
But you are absolutely right

1251
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,580
If one day everyone starts

1252
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,580
A certain cross-section

1253
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
Then in a certain mass

1254
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,580
Start to see the event

1255
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,580
When dark matter is here

1256
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,580
Think about it

1257
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,580
How to measure these signals

1258
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,580
To understand what it is

1259
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,580
Ok

1260
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,580
Thank you

1261
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,580
What are we doing now

1262
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
We are doing a time called cryogenic dark matter search

1263
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,580
Cryogenic means super low temperature

1264
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,580
What we are doing is like this

1265
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,580
What you see now is this right side

1266
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,580
It's a super thin or fold

1267
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,580
Group of germanium

1268
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
Its size

1269
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,580
It's about 10 centimeters

1270
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,580
Its thickness is 3.3 centimeters

1271
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,580
Not kilometers, it's centimeters

1272
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,580
So this is one you've never seen

1273
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Super big piece of germanium

1274
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,580
Or silicon

1275
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,580
You go out and buy wafer

1276
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,580
It will never help you cut such a thick piece

1277
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,580
But our detector looks like this

1278
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,580
If you look at the left

1279
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,580
This white line is dark matter

1280
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,580
Knock on the atomic box and run out

1281
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,580
Then see this blue one

1282
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,580
It will dissipate heat

1283
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,580
Then this heat dissipation

1284
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Because it is very, very low energy

1285
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,580
It is very localized

1286
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,580
Then at the same time

1287
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,580
The electrons in your material

1288
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,580
And this electric team

1289
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,580
So it will shoot this red

1290
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
Ok, this is the electronic electric team

1291
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,580
So what are we measuring

1292
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,580
We are measuring these electronic electric teams

1293
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,580
At the same time we are also measuring phonon

1294
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,580
We measured this phonon

1295
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,580
And this electric team

1296
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,580
We can see very, very small signals

1297
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,580
Ok, the next page is talking about

1298
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,580
Why do we have to measure at the same time

1299
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,580
Electronic electric team

1300
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,580
To measure phonon

1301
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,580
If today

1302
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,580
Particle is hit

1303
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,580
That atomic box

1304
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,580
It will be about 1 in 3

1305
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,580
Its phonon energy

1306
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,580
With ionization

1307
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,580
Is the electric team

1308
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,580
Energy ratio is about 1 to 3

1309
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,580
Phonon is about 3 times

1310
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,580
But if it hits today

1311
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,580
Is that electron

1312
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,580
100% electron

1313
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,580
Its ionization energy

1314
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,580
Is 100%

1315
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,580
So there is a difference of 1 to 3

1316
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,580
So if you see this picture next to it today

1317
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,580
There will be a very obvious difference

1318
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,580
So we can immediately identify

1319
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,580
It is hit

1320
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,580
Why is this important

1321
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,580
Because if today

1322
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,580
Is very heavy

1323
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,580
It will not leave energy

1324
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,580
It will leave energy

1325
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,580
So you want to vary

1326
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,580
This is a lot of energy

1327
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,580
To hit the atomic box

1328
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,580
Or we know

1329
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,580
To hit the electron

1330
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,580
So we have this ability

1331
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,580
I want to skip this

1332
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,580
So we are based on this ability

1333
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,580
We made a detector

1334
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,580
You see this big piece of crystal

1335
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,580
There are a lot of small things on the surface

1336
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,580
It is a super conductor

1337
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,580
When it picks up energy

1338
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,580
It will immediately from the superconductor

1339
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,580
Turn into a normal conductor

1340
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,580
In this fast

1341
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,580
In the process of transformation

1342
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,580
Its sensitivity is very large

1343
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,580
A little bit of energy

1344
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,580
Its electron will change a lot

1345
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,580
So we can use this thing to do very, very precise measurements

1346
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,580
At the same time, we also designed a very good

1347
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,580
This

1348
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,580
The distribution of electrons

1349
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,580
In the lower right corner of this picture

1350
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,580
If it is on the surface

1351
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,580
Hit

1352
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,580
Electrons and electrons will run to the same side

1353
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,580
If you hit it in the middle

1354
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,580
Electrons and electrons will be pulled to one side

1355
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,580
Why is this important

1356
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,580
Because most of the particles we already know

1357
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,580
Relative to dark matter

1358
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,580
It's easier to be blocked on the surface than in the middle

1359
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,580
Because dark matter is the hardest to block

1360
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,580
It will go to the middle

1361
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
So the more to the middle, the more like dark matter

1362
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,580
So we can do this

1363
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,580
I don't want to talk about this at all

1364
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,580
I just want to conclude

1365
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,580
About this kind

1366
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,580
Hit the nucleus or hit the electron

1367
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,580
This kind of detector

1368
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,580
In our expected detection time

1369
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,580
We have 100% confidence

1370
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,580
We can distinguish

1371
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,580
Nuclear recoil or

1372
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Electron recoil

1373
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,580
We can do a good job

1374
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,580
Find dark matter

1375
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,580
This kind of style

1376
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,580
Dark matter search

1377
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,580
In addition to this

1378
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,580
We have another thing to use

1379
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,580
This thing is called

1380
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,580
HV detector

1381
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,580
HV means high voltage

1382
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,580
We are on this

1383
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,580
Detector

1384
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,580
Add a very large

1385
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,580
This power plant

1386
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,580
If it is released

1387
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,580
Any free electronic electric team

1388
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,580
It will be very fast

1389
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,580
Speed ​​up

1390
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,580
It's in this crystal

1391
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,580
Middle speed

1392
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,580
But the reason is that it can't exceed

1393
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,580
So as long as it exceeds the middle speed

1394
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,580
It is called heat dissipation

1395
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,580
The meaning of heat dissipation

1396
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,580
Is to create additional

1397
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,580
Secondary phonon emission

1398
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,580
So you add a big power plant to it

1399
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,580
As long as you

1400
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,580
Activate a free

1401
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,580
Electronic electric team

1402
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,580
You will get a lot of phonon energy

1403
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,580
So

1404
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,580
We can put very small

1405
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,580
Enlarge to very large

1406
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,580
So at this time

1407
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,580
If your

1408
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,580
Threshold is from your electronic

1409
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,580
Noise

1410
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,580
Our signal will be far greater than the noise

1411
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,580
So we

1412
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,580
Equivalent trigger

1413
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,580
Trigger on specific recoil energy

1414
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,580
Our threshold will be very, very low

1415
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,580
We can lower the threshold by 100 times

1416
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,580
If you give it 100 volts

1417
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,580
This drift

1418
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,580
The voltage

1419
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,580
But what is his problem

1420
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,580
Basically you are now

1421
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,580
Electron recoil or nuclear recoil

1422
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,580
You have completely lost the distortion

1423
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,580
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil

1424
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,580
But we can see very small energy

1425
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,580
I don't want to talk about this

1426
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,580
Basically just want to say

1427
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,580
We have to build a big experiment

1428
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,580
And then get it to very, very low temperature

1429
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,580
Otherwise thermal agitation

1430
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,580
Will keep creating thermal phonon

1431
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,580
Ok

1432
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,580
I jumped directly to the last page

1433
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,580
Now everyone sees

1434
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,580
There is a lot of radioactivity

1435
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,580
What kind of money

1436
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,580
What is this

1437
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,580
Uranium

1438
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,580
These things are all in our experimental environment

1439
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,580
Then they will be radioactive

1440
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,580
Is to shoot all kinds of particles

1441
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,580
We want to make sure

1442
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,580
All these elements are very, very

1443
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,580
In our experiment

1444
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,580
We can see

1445
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,580
Just make sure that if there is really a signal today

1446
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,580
I saw we have a lot of confidence

1447
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,580
It will never be these impurities

1448
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,580
Radioactivity

1449
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,580
I don't want to skip this

1450
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,580
This is basically to say

1451
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,580
So we put all these

1452
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,580
Background radioactivity

1453
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,580
Then there is just said

1454
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,580
IZ and HV detector

1455
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,580
Germanium and silicon

1456
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,580
Then put it on

1457
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,580
You will see that in the end we can

1458
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,580
Dig this piece

1459
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,580
We haven't yet

1460
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,580
This 2020 will start

1461
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,580
It is expected to run for five years

1462
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,580
You can dig this piece

1463
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,580
Here is very sloppy

1464
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,580
Is there a problem

1465
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,580
Is this pink

1466
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,580
This orange pink piece

1467
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,580
Hey you say that again

1468
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,580
Did you just detect all the detect functions?

1469
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,580
Can you explain this place again?

1470
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,580
Can you explain this place again?

1471
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,580
Forget it

1472
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,580
Let's talk about it at the end

1473
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,580
It feels like it will be a long time

1474
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,580
Actually, it's okay

1475
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,580
This thing is what you think

1476
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,580
Is

1477
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,580
If you are today

1478
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,580
I just didn't say if your dark matter

1479
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,580
Hit the atomic box

1480
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,580
There will be one-third of the ionization

1481
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,580
One-third of the energy

1482
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,580
Will also become a double pair

1483
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,580
But if today your dark matter

1484
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,580
It's 100%

1485
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,580
If it's enough

1486
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,580
Then these two scenarios

1487
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,580
Will produce an electron and a double pair

1488
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,580
That produces an electron and a double pair

1489
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,580
Then I give it a high pressure

1490
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,580
This high pressure will pull this electron

1491
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,580
Accelerate to very fast

1492
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
Accelerate to exceed its terminal speed

1493
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,580
But when it exceeds the terminal speed

1494
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,580
It must decelerate

1495
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,580
Its principle is basically like this

1496
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,580
It decelerates

1497
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,580
It has to release energy

1498
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,580
So basically

1499
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,580
I don't care if I want to look at nuclear recoil

1500
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,580
Or electron recoil

1501
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,580
I'm starting to look at phonon now

1502
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,580
What about the phonon I see

1503
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,580
If today is nuclear recoil

1504
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,580
It primary

1505
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,580
There will be phonon

1506
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,580
Then the ionization it creates at the same time

1507
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,580
Pulled like this

1508
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,580
There will also be secondary phonon

1509
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,580
I look at nuclear recoil, I look at these two phonons

1510
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,580
Phonon signal

1511
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,580
But if today is electron recoil

1512
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,580
I basically look at these electrons

1513
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,580
After all were ionized

1514
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,580
How many secondary phonons did they create

1515
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,580
Probably like this

1516
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,580
Is it clear to me?

1517
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,580
Ok, keep going, thank you

1518
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,580
Ok

1519
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,580
This page

1520
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,580
I want to skip

1521
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,580
Ok, I'll just talk about this page

1522
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,580
I'm starting to talk now

1523
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,580
Sorry, I'm starting to talk now

1524
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,580
So how do all these things integrate into the future

1525
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,580
That is to say

1526
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,580
We found one thing

1527
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,580
I've been talking about it all the time

1528
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,580
Today

1529
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,580
If there is nuclear recoil

1530
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,580
About one-third of the energy

1531
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,580
You can still see one-third of the energy in ionization

1532
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,580
Compared to your phonon energy

1533
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,580
This thing

1534
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,580
Probably right

1535
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,580
Our best model now is called Linhardt

1536
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,580
This is actually a half century old model

1537
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,580
He explains

1538
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,580
That is

1539
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,580
The effect of electronic shielding on the atomic

1540
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,580
Then you can see

1541
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,580
One-third of this

1542
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,580
I just talked about one-third of it

1543
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,580
There is a blue line

1544
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,580
This is the model

1545
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,580
If you hit the energy

1546
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,580
What is above 10 keV

1547
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,580
It's all right

1548
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,580
But below 10 keV

1549
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,580
It's getting worse

1550
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,580
But no one knows

1551
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,580
Because no one could measure such a small energy

1552
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,580
But now everyone can measure such a small energy

1553
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,580
You have to measure very small energy

1554
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,580
You can start detecting very small

1555
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,580
Very light dark matter

1556
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,580
So this thing becomes very important

1557
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:19,580
So this is a very important direction

1558
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,580
We are going to start studying

1559
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,580
What is this ratio

1560
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,580
This thing is very

1561
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,580
Go hand in hand with low-threshold detector

1562
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,580
Because you can't

1563
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,580
You have to be able to measure such a small energy

1564
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,580
Then you can start constraining this ratio

1565
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,580
This ratio is currently

1566
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,580
If you want to measure nuclear recoil

1567
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,580
This is the highest level of certainty in your analysis

1568
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,580
Then skip this page

1569
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,580
The second one is

1570
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,580
We can put this kind of high-voltage

1571
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,580
How good is this kind of high-voltage detector

1572
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,580
How good is this kind of high-voltage detector

1573
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,580
What about a recent paper

1574
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,580
Stanford has a group

1575
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,580
They made this little chip

1576
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,580
This little chip is about 1 cm x 1 cm

1577
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,580
This is 1 cm x 1 cm

1578
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,580
Just as big as a thumb

1579
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,580
Then its thickness is 1 cm

1580
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,580
1 cm or half a centimeter

1581
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,580
Anyway, it's a

1582
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,580
It's a gram-scale small detector

1583
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,580
It's a gram-scale small detector

1584
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,580
So it can block the dark matter

1585
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,580
The rate is very low

1586
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,580
But it is super optimized

1587
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,580
This high-voltage

1588
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,580
Look at the design of the phonon detector

1589
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,580
Then what do you see now

1590
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,580
Is to see the picture on the right

1591
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,580
There is a single peak

1592
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,580
It's 0, 1, 2, 3

1593
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,580
These peaks are all separated

1594
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,580
What is this

1595
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,580
There is a signal in this crystal

1596
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,580
Created a single electron hole pair

1597
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,580
Double, triple electron hole pair

1598
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,580
It can see the quantized electron hole pair

1599
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,580
It can see the quantized electron hole pair

1600
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,580
It can see the quantized electron hole pair

1601
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,580
So this is

1602
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,580
You have to test

1603
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,580
To use HV detector

1604
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,580
Optimal sensitivity

1605
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,580
You can start counting

1606
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,580
Single electron hole pair

1607
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,580
Created by detecting phonon

1608
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,580
So you can see here

1609
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,580
Its energy threshold is super low

1610
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,580
Its energy threshold is super low

1611
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,580
It is 0.33eV

1612
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,580
It can shoot

1613
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,580
It only operates for one day

1614
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,580
It only operates for one day

1615
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,580
Within one day on surface

1616
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,580
And it doesn't even have to go underground

1617
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,580
To cover up those radioactivity

1618
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,580
To cover up those radioactivity

1619
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,580
This is the one I'm going to talk about

1620
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,580
This is the one I'm going to talk about

1621
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,580
This is the one I'm going to talk about

1622
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,580
You can see

1623
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,580
If I can use this

1624
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,580
If I can use this

1625
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,580
Now everyone wants to use this

1626
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,580
Now everyone wants to use this

1627
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,580
High voltage detector

1628
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,580
In order to increase

1629
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,580
It is offered tentest

1630
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,580
It is offered tentest

1631
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,580
It is offered tentest

1632
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,580
It is offered tentest

1633
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,580
It is offered tentest

1634
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,580
You see the dots

1635
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,580
You see the dots

1636
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,580
You see the dots

1637
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,580
Now there is a test called Sensai

1638
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,580
Now there is a test called Sensai

1639
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,580
It can do this

1640
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,580
We think that Super CDMX can do

1641
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,580
We think that Super CDMX can do

1642
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,580
It can do

1643
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,580
Lower than EMUV sensitivity

1644
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,580
If we can optimize

1645
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,580
If we can optimize

1646
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,580
It is the nature of HV detector

1647
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,580
It is the nature of HV detector

1648
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,580
I want to skip this page

1649
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,580
I want to skip this page

1650
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,580
Next is that we can optimize

1651
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,580
As I said, the phonon is a super conductor

1652
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,580
As I said, the phonon is a super conductor

1653
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,580
If, It is very sensitive

1654
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:33,580
As long as it picks up a bit of energy

1655
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,580
It accumulates from the super conductor

1656
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,580
It accumulates from the super conductor

1657
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,580
So we can measure a great change in electrons

1658
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,580
So we can measure a great change in electrons

1659
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:44,580
And here

1660
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,580
When the plusion picks up the energy

1661
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,580
When the plusion picks up the energy

1662
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,580
It is the resistance of the virtual conductor

1663
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,580
It is the resistance of the virtual conductor

1664
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,580
Now if the vector is a super conductor

1665
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,580
Now if the vector is a super conductor

1666
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,580
If we connect it to the capacitor

1667
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,580
It becomes a thermostat

1668
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,580
So if the grand thermostat changes

1669
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:07,580
It turns into the resonant freq

1670
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,580
So if a as you can see on the map

1671
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,580
So if a as you can see on the map

1672
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,580
Today if the cuper pair gets broken

1673
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,580
If the cuper pair gets broken

1674
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,580
and the impedance changes

1675
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,580
The resonant frequency will be different

1676
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,580
The resonant frequency will be different

1677
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:25,580
The interesting part is that every detector is small

1678
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,580
So I can see the next page

1679
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,580
So I can see the next page

1680
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,580
This is super cdms snowlab detector

1681
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,580
If you look at the bottom left

1682
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,580
If you look at the bottom left

1683
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,580
It has to connect a lot of small dds

1684
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,580
It has to connect a lot of small dds

1685
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,580
It has to connect a lot of small dds

1686
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,580
It has to change the capacitor

1687
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,580
It can make 12 pixels

1688
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,580
Because even if the capacitor is 0

1689
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,580
Because even if the capacitor is 0

1690
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,580
It is still small

1691
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,580
So you have to connect a lot of dds

1692
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,580
So you can see the signal

1693
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,580
So it can only make 12 pixels

1694
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,580
But if you look at the right picture

1695
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,580
This is what we are doing in the lab

1696
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,580
We use the way of super cdms

1697
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,580
We use the way of super cdms

1698
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,580
We can make every small square

1699
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,580
We can make every small square

1700
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,580
So basically we are doing 80,100,200 pixels

1701
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,580
So basically we are doing 80,100,200 pixels

1702
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,580
So this technology has been demonstrated

1703
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,580
So this technology has been demonstrated

1704
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,580
The energy resolution is the same as the TX

1705
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,580
The energy resolution is the same as the TX

1706
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,580
It's very easy to do

1707
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,580
It can save a lot of money

1708
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,580
It can save a lot of money

1709
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,580
It can save a lot of money

1710
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,580
OK that is what we want to do now

1711
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,580
OK that is what we want to do now

1712
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,580
There is also another aspect

1713
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,580
What we kept talking about

1714
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,580
What we kept talking about

1715
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,580
We want to use it as a target

1716
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,580
For dark matter

1717
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,580
For dark matter

1718
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,580
We can measure smaller energy

1719
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,580
We can measure smaller energy

1720
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,580
It's not exactly right

1721
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,580
In fact, we want to do

1722
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,580
We want to do

1723
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,580
We want to do

1724
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,580
First, the primary target

1725
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,580
We want to do

1726
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,580
We want to do

1727
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,580
We want to do

1728
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,580
But second

1729
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,580
It picks up the energy it wants to measure

1730
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,580
It picks up the energy it wants to measure

1731
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,580
It must have an excited state to jump on

1732
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:17,580
That's what we're looking at right now

1733
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,580
That's what we're looking at right now

1734
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:23,580
Half brain

1735
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:27,580
Except, there are more

1736
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,580
For example, like

1737
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,580
For example, like

1738
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,580
But the temperature will drift

1739
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,580
But the temperature will drift

1740
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,580
But the temperature will drift

1741
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,580
Or like diamonds

1742
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,580
Or like diamonds

1743
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,580
These semiconductors have different bandgaps

1744
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,580
Now a lot of people are thinking

1745
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,580
Can we pick up more fancy materials

1746
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,580
For example, gallium arsenide

1747
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,580
These materials

1748
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,580
To optimize the bandgap

1749
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,580
We can pick up less energy

1750
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,580
We can pick up less energy

1751
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,580
Another interesting thing is

1752
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,580
Germanium silicon is a pure material

1753
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,580
It has no polarization

1754
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,580
But if there is gallium arsenide today

1755
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,580
It will have a very strong dipole

1756
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,580
So it will produce

1757
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,580
I need to supply

1758
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,580
I need to supply

1759
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,580
I just said at the beginning

1760
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,580
If I can supply a single particle

1761
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,580
I can force it to keep running

1762
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,580
There will be a very strong coupling

1763
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,580
So materials like gallium arsenide

1764
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,580
So materials like gallium arsenide

1765
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,580
Axion-like particles or photon coupling

1766
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,580
Axion-like particles or photon coupling

1767
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
This is the first

1768
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,580
But I can go further

1769
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,580
Can I find

1770
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,580
Smaller materials

1771
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,580
For example, superconductor

1772
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,580
For example, superconductor

1773
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,580
Or superfluid helium

1774
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,580
Now the bandgap is directly from

1775
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,580
EV to mini-EV

1776
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,580
You can measure very small energy

1777
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,580
This is far future

1778
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,580
This is far future

1779
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,580
If you look at the picture in the lower right corner

1780
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,580
If you look at the picture in the lower right corner

1781
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:03,580
If you use scattering

1782
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,580
Or EM absorption

1783
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,580
Or EM absorption

1784
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,580
What we are doing now

1785
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,580
What we are doing now

1786
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,580
If you see the semiconductor in the middle

1787
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,580
If you see the semiconductor in the middle

1788
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,580
Or scintillator

1789
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,580
Basically ionization

1790
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,580
Basically ionization

1791
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,580
Traditionally the only thing that can be dug into WIMP

1792
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,580
Traditionally the only thing that can be dug into WIMP

1793
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,580
But in the future

1794
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,580
Many people are thinking to use superfluid

1795
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,580
Many people are thinking to use superfluid

1796
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,580
Or superconductor as a target

1797
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,580
This is also a direction

1798
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,580
This is also a direction

1799
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,580
What did I say today?

1800
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:41,580
Let me summarize

1801
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,580
In the dark matter community

1802
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,580
In the dark matter community

1803
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,580
There is a paradigm shift

1804
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,580
From classical WIMP

1805
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,580
Everyone started to pay more attention to low mass dark matter

1806
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,580
Everyone started to pay more attention to low mass dark matter

1807
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,580
For example, in the EV scale

1808
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,580
There may be Daryl, Neutrino

1809
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,580
Or in the MEV, Dark Sector

1810
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,580
There are many models that can be done

1811
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,580
Traditionally, when doing WIMP search in dark matter

1812
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,580
Everyone only cares about nuclear recoil

1813
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,580
Because it's very heavy in that scale

1814
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,580
You just want to hit the nuclear

1815
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,580
You won't have a signal when you hit the electron

1816
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,580
But now everyone is starting to pay attention

1817
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,580
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil

1818
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,580
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil

1819
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,580
It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology

1820
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,580
It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology

1821
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,580
It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology

1822
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,580
About this

1823
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,580
I think it's fair to say

1824
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,580
Super CDMX is the best

1825
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,580
Basically, we have iZip

1826
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,580
Can do ERNR discriminating

1827
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,580
Tagging search

1828
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,580
Or I can do

1829
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,580
Ultra low threshold, ultra small energy search

1830
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,580
Ultra low threshold, ultra small energy search

1831
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,580
Future

1832
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,580
I want to be able to measure

1833
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:47,580
More technology

1834
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,580
Can measure smaller recoil

1835
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,580
I want to have better calibration

1836
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,580
To understand

1837
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,580
How much ratio it has in NR

1838
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,580
You can see ionization

1839
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,580
What we can do now

1840
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,580
Ionization quantum counting detector

1841
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,580
Ionization quantum counting detector

1842
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,580
I just introduced

1843
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,580
In addition to measuring the change of electrons

1844
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,580
Ultrasound sensor

1845
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,580
Can also be used to measure the change of electrons

1846
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,580
It has many benefits

1847
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,580
The most important thing is

1848
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,580
Eventually we want to measure

1849
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,580
Thermorelic lower bound

1850
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,580
Thermorelic lower bound

1851
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,580
Probably KEV

1852
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,580
If I remember correctly

1853
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,580
KEV

1854
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,580
ER

1855
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,580
Electron

1856
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,580
Because I want to have a very light target

1857
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:35,580
I can maximize my energy

1858
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,580
Thank you

1859
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,580
Um, do you have any questions?

1860
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,580
What is this clip?

1861
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,580
Oh, this is a very good question

1862
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,580
Oh, this is a very good question

1863
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,580
Um

1864
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,580
What is this

1865
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,580
Um, I'm back

1866
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,580
Is this a toy?

1867
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,580
Yes, this is a toy

1868
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,580
Look at the bottom right corner of this video

1869
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,580
Look at the bottom right corner of this video

1870
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,580
There is a called the particle zoo

1871
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,580
If you google the particle zoo

1872
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,580
It is a company

1873
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,580
It has a lot of dolls

1874
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,580
All we know

1875
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,580
Hypothetical

1876
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,580
Or all kinds of particles

1877
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,580
Are made into toys

1878
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,580
The black square is dark matter

1879
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,580
All other people

1880
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,580
It's all cotton

1881
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,580
Only dark matter is sand

1882
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,580
Because it is very heavy

1883
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,580
That's probably the concept

1884
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:51,580
But that's because it was a model

1885
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,580
I think it can start to sand cotton

1886
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,580
I think it can start to sand cotton

1887
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,580
OK

1888
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,580
Is this a business statement?

1889
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,580
No, it's not

1890
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,580
Should not be a business statement

1891
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,580
It's a

1892
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,580
I don't know if it's still running

1893
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,580
It seems to have become a bit like a non-profit

1894
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,580
It's a company that accepts people's donations

1895
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,580
Because business is not good

1896
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,580
It's cool to open a website

1897
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,580
Sorry

1898
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,580
Any other questions?

1899
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,580
Someone asked first

1900
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,580
Then I'll ask first

1901
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,580
Zhang Youning

1902
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,580
Everyone has their own opinion

1903
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,580
What to measure

1904
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,580
Different methods

1905
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,580
Eliminate

1906
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,580
Improving the ratio of information

1907
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,580
Then your

1908
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,580
Talk will talk about it

1909
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,580
Do you have a

1910
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,580
Value or a definition

1911
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,580
Theoretical scientist

1912
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,580
He said

1913
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,580
If we measure something

1914
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,580
Or when we get to a certain value

1915
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,580
We call it measured

1916
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,580
Or

1917
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,580
Prove that there is a dark matter value

1918
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,580
Up to 99.97

1919
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,580
Have

1920
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,580
Basically your question is

1921
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,580
How do I define

1922
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,580
Correct

1923
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,580
The answer is

1924
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,580
The answer is

1925
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,580
There are two ways

1926
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,580
You actually don't know

1927
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,580
Your background

1928
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,580
What should it look like

1929
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,580
What is the probability

1930
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,580
If so

1931
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,580
Is to put your background

1932
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,580
This rate

1933
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,580
Keep erasing

1934
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,580
It's in you

1935
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,580
It's in you

1936
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,580
Your experiment

1937
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,580
Then according to your

1938
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,580
The size of the experiment

1939
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,580
Theoretically it should not appear

1940
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,580
Any

1941
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,580
OK

1942
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,580
That

1943
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,580
If it should not appear

1944
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,580
Then today you measured it once

1945
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,580
Then

1946
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,580
I can tell you

1947
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,580
What is the probability of it

1948
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,580
But you measured 30

1949
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,580
Then ask

1950
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,580
How much confidence do you have

1951
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,580
This is from another source

1952
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,580
This is a very common statistic

1953
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,580
Right

1954
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,580
But the key to this whole thing is

1955
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,580
You have to put your background

1956
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,580
You can't see it at all

1957
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,580
You will know when you see it

1958
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,580
The second one

1959
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,580
That is

1960
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,580
If you have a background

1961
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,580
Appearance frequency

1962
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,580
Or for a certain parameter

1963
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,580
Parameter you can measure

1964
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,580
There is a certain understanding

1965
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,580
OK

1966
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:57,580
Then you have a curve

1967
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,580
You can see what you see

1968
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,580
In this parameter you can measure

1969
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,580
Distribution above

1970
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,580
OK

1971
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,580
Then if there is

1972
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,580
A big one

1973
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,580
Beyond your model

1974
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,580
You can't see it

1975
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,580
You will have enough confidence to say

1976
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:17,580
How much confidence it is

1977
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,580
Is with

1978
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,580
This distribution is not consistent

1979
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,580
Do you understand

1980
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,580
Did I explain

1981
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,580
Um

1982
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,580
I understand

1983
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,580
Just

1984
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,580
You just mentioned

1985
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,580
How much

1986
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,580
My understanding is probably like this

1987
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,580
Um

1988
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,580
Hey i think

1989
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,580
After the noise

1990
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,580
The rest is the signal

1991
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,580
Then the signal is that I have measured

1992
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,580
I'm just curious

1993
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,580
Can you recognize the cup or

1994
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,580
Uh

1995
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,580
Things like

1996
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,580
Hey

1997
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,580
Uh

1998
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,580
I think

1999
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,580
I think this is the case

2000
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,580
No one should know where it will be measured

2001
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,580
But

2002
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,580
Uh

2003
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:11,580
What to do now is that you can measure

2004
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,580
A pile of signals

2005
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,580
Then these signals give you enough

2006
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,580
Confidence level

2007
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,580
This is definitely not

2008
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,580
What we expect to see

2009
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,580
Then this is the cup

2010
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:25,580
Oh

2011
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,580
This is the conclusion, this means that it is a new thing

2012
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,580
By definition it is dark matter

2013
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,580
Right

2014
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,580
Because we don't know

2015
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,580
Super cdms threshold

2016
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,580
5 sigma

2017
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,580
Uh super cdms

2018
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,580
Threshold you mean

2019
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,580
Uh you mean

2020
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,580
Detection or you mean

2021
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,580
Detector itself

2022
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,580
Signal to noise ratio

2023
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,580
Uh i mean you measured the signal

2024
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:53,580
With the cup

2025
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,580
Oh yeah yeah

2026
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,580
If we are

2027
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,580
Eventually we want to send

2028
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,580
Uh we

2029
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,580
Want to send

2030
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:05,580
If we want to claim detection

2031
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,580
5 sigma

2032
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,580
But um

2033
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,580
The problem now is

2034
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,580
If we are today

2035
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,580
Not so good

2036
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,580
Or we are

2037
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,580
Select material

2038
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,580
Not so good

2039
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,580
Not very clean

2040
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,580
Eventually

2041
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,580
What is it

2042
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:29,580
4 events

2043
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,580
You can claim

2044
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,580
I saw an event nearby

2045
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,580
But the confidence level is very low

2046
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,580
Or you can say

2047
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,580
Uh this thing will degrade my limit

2048
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,580
But I assume that I made a mistake

2049
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,580
Uh i don't think

2050
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,580
In the future we will

2051
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,580
Like we used to do

2052
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,580
Is that we will say

2053
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,580
Hey we see

2054
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,580
Signal and then we are

2055
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,580
Draw a contour on the limit plot

2056
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,580
But this contour is 90% confidence

2057
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,580
I don't think we will do this in the future

2058
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,580
We used to do this

2059
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,580
But we

2060
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,580
Should be quite clear in the future

2061
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,580
We will only say at least 25

2062
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,580
Because 25 is your zero background

2063
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,580
If you are plus on fluctuation

2064
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,580
You should be square root

2065
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,580
At least 25

2066
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,580
We might say uh we claim

2067
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,580
See something

2068
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,580
Uh

2069
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,580
Correct

2070
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,580
Any questions

2071
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,580
Uh i'm curious

2072
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,580
Is you

2073
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,580
After this device is designed

2074
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,580
What kind of experiment is it

2075
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,580
To do validation

2076
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,580
Is to confirm this instrument

2077
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,580
Indeed doing what you want

2078
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,580
Want to do

2079
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,580
Just do validation

2080
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,580
Uh i don't know

2081
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:51,580
How to say

2082
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,580
Um ok

2083
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,580
I think this can go back to the page I just skipped

2084
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,580
Very very messy

2085
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,580
That page

2086
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,580
I thought it might be

2087
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,580
High-performance experiment

2088
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,580
Detector people will be more interested

2089
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,580
So i skipped

2090
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,580
Ok ok what do you see now

2091
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,580
What you see now is

2092
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,580
Uh let's just say

2093
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,580
Let's take a look

2094
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,580
Let's just talk about the picture on the right

2095
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,580
The picture on the right

2096
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,580
You see a lot of different colors

2097
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,580
Dot

2098
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,580
This is horizontal

2099
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:29,580
What you see is

2100
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,580
I'm on the front

2101
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,580
And the opposite side

2102
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,580
Electricity

2103
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,580
The difference in energy

2104
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,580
Ok so it's

2105
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,580
It's a normalization

2106
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,580
Ok

2107
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,580
That is to say

2108
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,580
The difference in ionization

2109
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,580
Then what you see is

2110
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:51,580
Phonon and ionization

2111
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,580
The ratio is the one I just said

2112
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,580
One third is nr

2113
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:57,580
Ok so you see a lot of different colors

2114
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,580
This color is actually added later

2115
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,580
Then you see me now

2116
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,580
Circle up there

2117
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,580
There is a thing called california cf252

2118
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,580
This is a radiative element

2119
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,580
It will always shoot out the middle finger

2120
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,580
We basically put a middle finger

2121
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,580
Radiator

2122
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,580
Put it on our detector

2123
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,580
That middle finger keeps hitting

2124
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,580
We think this should be the signal we want to see

2125
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,580
It should look like

2126
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,580
Because if today is

2127
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,580
Anything else

2128
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,580
It will act as a battery interaction

2129
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,580
Whether it's gamma ray

2130
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,580
Whether it's IR photon

2131
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,580
Or electron

2132
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,580
Its

2133
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,580
It will be immediately

2134
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:39,580
Will act as a battery

2135
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,580
Block down

2136
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,580
What you see at this time

2137
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,580
It's not like your dark matter

2138
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,580
Dark matter won't do this

2139
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,580
So basically

2140
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,580
What we are looking for is neutral particle

2141
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,580
Then a very strong neutral particle

2142
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,580
Will hit the atomic box

2143
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,580
Then we think this signal

2144
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,580
It's like we can see

2145
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,580
Dark matter

2146
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,580
So you see this california cf252

2147
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,580
Is neutral source

2148
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,580
So in other words, we can tag it next to it

2149
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,580
It's background

2150
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,580
This comes from a very strong

2151
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,580
EM interaction source

2152
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,580
That's led 210

2153
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,580
So we're the same

2154
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,580
Put led 210 on our detector

2155
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,580
Then see these signals

2156
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,580
Then find out

2157
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:25,580
As we expected

2158
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,580
Where the background should go

2159
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:29,580
We basically do this

2160
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,580
Does this answer your question?

2161
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,580
Yes

2162
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,580
Then I have another one

2163
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,580
A more extensive question is

2164
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,580
If I understand

2165
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,580
You guys have been following up

2166
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,580
Able to measure

2167
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,580
Because it can measure lighter

2168
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,580
Mass

2169
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:51,580
But if you only use a single

2170
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:53,580
It's usually neutral

2171
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,580
Then its mass is

2172
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,580
I don't know much about physics

2173
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:59,580
But in my impression, it should be

2174
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,580
So you can't confirm

2175
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,580
Your instrument can measure

2176
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,580
Mass

2177
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,580
That's right

2178
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,580
I have to say

2179
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,580
Unless we have a dark matter source

2180
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,580
Can calibrate our detector

2181
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,580
Otherwise we will never know

2182
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,580
What it looks like

2183
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,580
But if we can do that

2184
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,580
We don't have to measure anymore

2185
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,580
So you're totally right

2186
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,580
So there are some assumptions here

2187
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,580
The assumption here is

2188
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,580
We take our neutral to hit it

2189
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,580
The energy it leaves

2190
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,580
Energy is energy

2191
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,580
It's not because it's from

2192
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,580
Neutron to hit

2193
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,580
There is a difference

2194
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,580
So what we measured today

2195
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,580
How much energy does it leave

2196
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,580
Then based on this energy

2197
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,580
Say OK

2198
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,580
So the response I see in this energy

2199
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,580
Is it the response I expect to see in this energy?

2200
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,580
So basically

2201
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:57,580
I don't care if it's neutral

2202
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,580
But this assumption is like this

2203
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:01,580
If you leave

2204
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,580
For example, 1 keV

2205
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:05,580
But this 1 keV comes from dark matter or neutron

2206
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,580
In the end, your detector will have a different response

2207
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,580
Then this will be different

2208
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,580
This is a systematic

2209
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,580
But this is the best we can do

2210
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,580
Because we don't have a dark matter source

2211
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,580
I think I understand

2212
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,580
Thank you

2213
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,580
I want to ask a question

2214
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,580
That picture can be

2215
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,580
There is a picture of Sigma vs Max

2216
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,580
It's behind

2217
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:35,580
Drawing a lot of different experiments

2218
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,580
This

2219
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,580
I just want to ask

2220
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,580
Just assume

2221
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,580
We want to do a new experiment now

2222
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:51,580
Or maybe

2223
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,580
Or improve other experiments

2224
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,580
Do you have any suggestions

2225
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:57,580
For example, because these lines

2226
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,580
It's probably

2227
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,580
For example, its peak is probably

2228
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,580
It's around 10

2229
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,580
So if we want to do something else later

2230
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,580
For example, further

2231
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,580
Or do other experiments

2232
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,580
You will feel

2233
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,580
For example, we want to prove

2234
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,580
Of course, the further to the left

2235
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,580
Or basically

2236
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,580
For example, the part above the xenon

2237
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,580
Is also the direction we can do

2238
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,580
That is, if

2239
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,580
If you want to do other experiments

2240
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,580
This picture is basically like this

2241
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,580
There are two directions you can go

2242
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,580
Because this is a 2D picture

2243
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,580
So there are two directions you can go

2244
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,580
One is horizontal and one is vertical

2245
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,580
Let's talk about what it means

2246
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,580
It means

2247
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,580
If you go horizontally

2248
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,580
Basically you are in the probe

2249
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,580
Different dark matter mass

2250
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,580
If you go down

2251
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,580
It's the same mass in the probe

2252
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,580
But smaller

2253
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,580
Smaller

2254
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,580
Interaction cross action

2255
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,580
No problem

2256
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,580
But why do these pictures show

2257
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,580
A straight line down

2258
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:09,580
Then diagonally up a straight line

2259
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:11,580
Triangle

2260
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,580
This is probably the principle

2261
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,580
Detector has its own noise

2262
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,580
Below this noise

2263
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:21,580
Then you are completely

2264
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,580
Always noise

2265
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,580
So you can't measure

2266
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,580
You can only be above this line

2267
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:29,580
That is Trigger Threshold

2268
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,580
So that Trigger Threshold defines

2269
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,580
The energy you can measure

2270
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,580
In other words, it basically defines

2271
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,580
You can measure the smallest particle mass

2272
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,580
So this is the left one

2273
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,580
Very sharp straight line

2274
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,580
The right side is diagonally up

2275
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,580
This is a log-log picture

2276
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,580
So it's a log-log straight line

2277
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,580
This basically means

2278
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,580
You assume

2279
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,580
The larger the particle mass

2280
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,580
The less you see

2281
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,580
So

2282
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,580
Without seeing or seeing the same rate

2283
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,580
The situation you can set

2284
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,580
The weaker the limit

2285
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,580
Because this principle is very simple

2286
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,580
Because you know we are here

2287
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,580
Is this dark matter

2288
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,580
How much is the mass density of Halo

2289
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,580
But mass density must be converted

2290
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,580
To number density

2291
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,580
To the mass

2292
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,580
So the heavier the particle

2293
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,580
The less

2294
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:23,580
So hit your rate

2295
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,580
Is 1 over m less

2296
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,580
Do you understand

2297
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,580
So the line on the right is probably

2298
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,580
This means

2299
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,580
First, I don't think

2300
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,580
Different experiments

2301
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,580
It should be said that the same experimental technology

2302
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,580
Basically it is set

2303
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,580
Where is its Threshold

2304
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,580
So the super straight line on the right

2305
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,580
It's hard to move

2306
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,580
So if you want to change the line on the right

2307
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,580
Basically you have to change

2308
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,580
New technology

2309
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,580
Not to say

2310
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,580
How to get it

2311
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,580
It can run left and right

2312
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,580
It can only run up and down

2313
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,580
Basically these lines can only run up and down

2314
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,580
OK

2315
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,580
Is it 1 over F?

2316
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:11,580
No no no

2317
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,580
Because this is the mass

2318
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,580
This is the cross section

2319
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,580
So that line basically means

2320
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,580
Your Threshold is there

2321
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:21,580
The gray line on the left

2322
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:23,580
The line in the area is not

2323
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,580
Which one

2324
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,580
The picture on the right

2325
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:29,580
The picture on the left

2326
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,580
Is this

2327
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,580
Yes

2328
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:35,580
It should not be written on it

2329
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:37,580
You can follow

2330
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,580
I'll explain that later

2331
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,580
OK

2332
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,580
So I don't think

2333
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:45,580
Use existing technology

2334
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,580
It should not be said that I don't think

2335
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,580
This is a recognition

2336
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:51,580
Use the same technology

2337
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,580
The bigger you can build

2338
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,580
The more you use

2339
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:57,580
The conclusion is

2340
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:59,580
In the same time

2341
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,580
In theory, you can block more

2342
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,580
So if you don't block

2343
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,580
You can set a stronger limit

2344
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,580
But basically can't run left and right

2345
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:09,580
Run left and right

2346
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:11,580
Is to use different technology

2347
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,580
So different technology

2348
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,580
What is this technology

2349
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:17,580
Is to reduce your Threshold

2350
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,580
So basically what you can find

2351
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,580
Is to find a way to reduce Threshold

2352
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,580
OK

2353
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,580
So in this picture you can see

2354
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:27,580
The most obvious Threshold

2355
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,580
The lowest is the light green

2356
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:31,580
I point to this place

2357
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,580
Why

2358
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,580
I think the answer is different from others

2359
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,580
If you go to track

2360
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,580
The label

2361
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,580
You will see

2362
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,580
Aluminum SC

2363
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:45,580
10mEV

2364
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,580
What is that

2365
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,580
Aluminum superconductor

2366
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,580
Its bandgap is 10mEV

2367
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,580
In fact, it is less than 10mEV

2368
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,580
But its order of magnitude is 10mEV

2369
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,580
It can slide over there

2370
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,580
That

2371
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,580
The rest you see

2372
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,580
The light blue, dark blue

2373
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,580
Dark green

2374
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:07,580
What are these things

2375
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:09,580
These are all semiconductors

2376
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,580
So it actually has a label

2377
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,580
What is silicon

2378
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,580
Garlium arsenide

2379
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:17,580
Silicon

2380
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,580
They just take silicon

2381
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,580
In a different way

2382
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,580
Readout or readout or assembly

2383
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,580
They are all over there

2384
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,580
Then it actually has a label

2385
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,580
Its Threshold

2386
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,580
Let me see

2387
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,580
Semiconductor Threshold is 10mEV

2388
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:37,580
10mEV

2389
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,580
I personally think

2390
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,580
Go to a smaller Threshold

2391
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,580
And the order of magnitude difference

2392
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,580
Is to change the material

2393
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,580
Now CEMS

2394
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,580
I think we are already

2395
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,580
Master

2396
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,580
Semiconductor

2397
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,580
Technology

2398
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,580
Yes

2399
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,580
So there may be

2400
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,580
In short, it is

2401
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,580
It depends on the signal to noise

2402
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,580
The threshold of noise

2403
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,580
So basically

2404
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,580
Unless you change the material

2405
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,580
It is unlikely to move

2406
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,580
I think long term is to change the material

2407
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:15,580
But is it possible to move

2408
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,580
Yes, you can understand

2409
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,580
What is your noise

2410
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:21,580
You can understand what your noise is

2411
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,580
Maybe you can reduce it

2412
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,580
Eventually you can assume

2413
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:27,580
If you are noise-free

2414
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,580
Probably still around that

2415
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,580
Can you reduce noise

2416
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,580
Just in this group

2417
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,580
Semiconductor experiment

2418
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,580
Can you be better

2419
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,580
That's about it

2420
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,580
OK

2421
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,580
You can ask

2422
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,580
It doesn't matter

2423
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,580
You continue

2424
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:53,580
I just thought

2425
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:55,580
Dark Matter Halo

2426
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:57,580
Because you just said

2427
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,580
It rotates in the universe

2428
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,580
Then we can accept it

2429
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:03,580
Does it have a number

2430
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,580
For example, like Collider

2431
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,580
Will it be here

2432
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,580
It is with the earth

2433
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,580
Our detector

2434
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:13,580
Relative to this

2435
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,580
Dark Matter Halo

2436
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,580
How much is the luminosity

2437
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,580
There is this number

2438
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,580
This can be calculated

2439
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:23,580
Let me explain

2440
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,580
OK

2441
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,580
What this picture draws

2442
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,580
The solar system is here

2443
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,580
Right

2444
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,580
We know

2445
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:39,580
The sun revolves around the Milky Way

2446
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,580
How fast

2447
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,580
Right

2448
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:45,580
We also know

2449
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,580
We observe

2450
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,580
Our track

2451
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,580
The quality of the package

2452
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,580
How much is the quality of pulling us

2453
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,580
Right

2454
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,580
So we immediately know

2455
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,580
How much is there

2456
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,580
Missing mass

2457
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,580
Can it be

2458
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:07,580
But this is total mass

2459
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,580
But if I do

2460
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,580
The same thing

2461
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,580
But I started from the middle of the reactor

2462
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:15,580
Can I just make

2463
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,580
How to say

2464
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:19,580
Delta R

2465
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:21,580
How much is it

2466
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,580
Do I know

2467
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,580
Every radius

2468
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:27,580
Dark Matter Density

2469
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,580
How much

2470
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,580
Right

2471
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,580
How much

2472
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,580
How much

2473
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,580
How fast

2474
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:39,580
I know

2475
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:41,580
How much

2476
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,580
How much

2477
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,580
The only difference is

2478
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,580
I don't know how heavy this particle is

2479
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,580
So number density

2480
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,580
You have to assume a mass

2481
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:53,580
So number density

2482
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,580
Basically depends on your model

2483
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,580
But we actually know

2484
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,580
What is this

2485
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,580
Mass density

2486
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:03,580
That's it

2487
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:05,580
So that's model

2488
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:07,580
Independent

2489
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,580
But basically

2490
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,580
But basically when we draw

2491
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,580
Is to draw all the mass

2492
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:15,580
A point becomes a line

2493
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:17,580
I don't know how much this mass is

2494
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,580
Every mass I draw

2495
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,580
It becomes a line

2496
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:23,580
OK

2497
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,580
it is good

2498
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:27,580
OK

2499
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,580
OK

2500
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,580
That should be the same

2501
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,580
Thank you

2502
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:37,580
OK

2503
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,580
Time is almost up today

2504
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,580
Do you have any questions

2505
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,580
I have some questions

2506
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,580
Can I ask

2507
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,580
I have a little suggestion

2508
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,580
I'm totally OK

2509
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:57,580
Stay and ask questions

2510
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,580
But because California is almost 9 o'clock

2511
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,580
If the host wants to go home

2512
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,580
Can go home

2513
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:05,580
I don't know where you are now

2514
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,580
Anyway

2515
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:09,580
If you want to download it, you can download it

2516
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,580
Anyway, the recording is over

2517
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,580
Then we can continue to discuss

2518
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:17,580
I am actually

2519
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,580
I have one or two questions

2520
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,580
but

2521
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,580
I don't know if everyone has

2522
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:25,580
That's it

2523
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,580
Let's continue

2524
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,580
I have a personal article

2525
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,580
OK

2526
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:33,580
OK

2527
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,580
OK

2528
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:37,580
Then I will stop the recording first

2529
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:39,580
OK
