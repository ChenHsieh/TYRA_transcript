0	7000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to the last Tera Talk this year.
7000	13000	We are honored to have Dr. He Shuai-Pu at Princeton University.
13000	20000	He is going to talk about Large Millimeter Volumetric Array for CMB Observation.
20000	23000	Let me introduce Dr. He first.
23000	28000	He got his Ph.D. in Physics at Princeton in 2017.
28000	31000	He is now working as a postdoc at Princeton.
31000	39000	His main focus is Experimental Cosmology.
39000	44000	His main work is Detector and Readout Development.
44000	50000	He has participated in several flagship CMB experiments.
50000	62000	Such as ABS-Atacama BMO Search, ACT-POL, Advanced ACT, Simons Observatory, and CMBS-POL.
62000	68000	Before I start, I'd like to say that
68000	80000	our goal is to share our progress with Taiwanese students around the world.
80000	88000	We hope to increase the opportunities for cooperation and exchange.
88000	92000	If you are interested in participating in our project,
92000	96000	we hope you can sign up for our talk next year.
96000	100000	You can sign up for our talk on our Facebook page.
100000	105000	Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. He.
109000	111000	Hello, everyone.
111000	118000	I'm going to talk about Large Millimeter Volumetric Array for CMB Observation.
118000	125000	The topics I'm going to cover are mainly two experiments.
125000	131000	You can see ACT-POL on the right side of the page.
131000	133000	There are some collaborations.
133000	137000	They are mainly founded by NSF and Chile Conocet.
137000	142000	The other one is Simons Observatory.
142000	147000	You can see that the collaboration has become larger.
147000	151000	It's mainly founded by Simons Foundation.
151000	153000	Okay, let's move on.
153000	157000	There is a beautiful starry sky with our telescope.
157000	164000	You may be familiar with this picture.
164000	171000	On the left is the starting point, Big Ben.
171000	173000	Of course, there is an argument.
173000	175000	There is no Big Ben.
176000	183000	As time goes by, it becomes where we are now.
183000	189000	I mainly study cosmic background radiation, CMB.
189000	194000	It is the first light we can see.
194000	202000	It originated about 400,000 years ago.
202000	206000	Or 380,000 years ago.
206000	212000	What can we learn from this study?
212000	217000	When we look at CMB,
217000	225000	the first thing we look at is its intensity.
225000	232000	This is Planck's intensity map.
232000	236000	There are hot spots and cold spots.
236000	240000	It is a full sky observation.
240000	243000	In addition to intensity,
243000	250000	there is a weak signal, polarization.
250000	256000	It is mainly from electrons and photons.
256000	258000	There is Thomson scattering,
258000	260000	which causes linear polarization.
260000	264000	When we observe this polarization directly,
264000	270000	you will see a cross mark on the left.
270000	275000	There is a 45-degree cross mark on the right.
275000	278000	This is called Q and U.
278000	283000	This is the map we can observe most directly.
283000	287000	This means that we have observed polarization.
287000	296000	We usually convert it into E mode and B mode.
296000	315000	You can see that E mode has symmetry and B mode does not.
316000	326000	This is the map we can observe most directly.
326000	329000	We usually convert it into E mode and B mode.
329000	347000	You can see that the temperature of the power spectrum is 10³µKv².
347000	351000	It is actually a very weak signal.
351000	354000	But the signal of polarization is smaller,
354000	357000	about one tenth or less.
357000	364000	So we can measure the temperature very precisely.
364000	367000	But when you want to measure polarization,
367000	373000	you need a more sensitive instrument to detect it more accurately.
374000	382000	This is a theory model.
382000	391000	And this is the data obtained from recent experiments.
403000	406000	This is a map of the universe.
406000	410000	If we look at the CMB directly,
410000	417000	we can know how old the universe is.
417000	421000	Although we know that the universe is more than 400,000 years old,
421000	423000	we want to know more precisely.
423000	427000	The shape of the universe and its structural formation.
427000	432000	But we also have more secondary anisotropy to understand.
432000	438000	Because light passes through so many things in the middle and reaches our eyes.
438000	445000	We can know some secondary effects from it.
445000	449000	For example, gravitational lensing or SZ effect.
449000	462000	We can also know that there are some stars or galaxies in the middle of the universe.
462000	472000	So why is it difficult to measure CMB?
472000	474000	As I said earlier,
474000	477000	just look at the temperature and anisotropy,
477000	482000	the temperature signal is about 10 to the 3 microKelvin squared.
482000	487000	You can see that there is a Cyan line here.
487000	494000	But in between CMB and our eyes,
494000	496000	there are many other things in the middle.
496000	504000	The main components of CMB are dust and synchrotron.
504000	509000	The red band and the green line.
509000	514000	When you see the polarization signal is weaker,
514000	519000	you can see that the impact of dust and synchrotron is deeper.
519000	527000	This means that we need a way to decompose the different components.
527000	538000	To understand the character of dust and synchrotron at different frequencies.
538000	544000	Then you can remove it to get pure CMB.
544000	551000	Therefore, when we develop instruments,
551000	553000	we need to have different frequency bands.
553000	556000	The more cover, the more frequency band.
556000	558000	The more cover, the more sky.
558000	565000	In this way, we can remove these extra signals to get pure CMB.
566000	571000	From the beginning,
571000	578000	of course, there are so many dust and synchrotron in the outer space.
578000	585000	You don't want to interfere with your observations from other sources.
585000	590000	So, the cleanest way is to transfer everything to outer space.
590000	598000	There is COBE satellite, WMAP, and Planck.
598000	601000	You can see that the sensitivity is getting higher and higher.
601000	610000	But sending everything to outer space is a very expensive thing.
611000	621000	Another way is to build a telescope on the earth.
621000	626000	But that requires a longer period of time.
626000	630000	And your instrument needs to be more sensitive.
631000	640000	So, there are two main places where we build telescopes to observe CMB.
640000	642000	One is Atacama Desert, Chile.
642000	644000	The other is Antarctica.
644000	648000	In Atacama Desert and Chile,
648000	651000	there are ACT, Polar Bear, and Klaus.
651000	655000	They are mainly focused on CMB observation.
655000	659000	In Antarctica, there are mainly SPT, BICEP, and Keck Array.
659000	670000	So, in the five ground-based experiments we just talked about,
670000	677000	the technology we use is called Transition Edge Sensor, or TES.
677000	681000	TES is a barometer.
681000	685000	When the photon comes in,
686000	692000	the barometer has a weak thermal path to the T bath.
692000	695000	When the photon comes in,
695000	700000	the temperature of TES will rise.
700000	704000	TES is a very sharp transition.
704000	709000	When the temperature of TES rises,
709000	712000	the resistance of TES also rises.
713000	719000	The dual power of TES will decrease.
719000	723000	TES is in a stable state.
723000	727000	How do you read the signal of TES?
727000	732000	We use a coupler to an inductor.
732000	736000	The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.
736000	740000	The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.
740000	743000	The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.
743000	746000	The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.
746000	749000	This is a simple way to read the signal.
749000	752000	What does TES look like?
752000	757000	This is a typical TES design.
757000	760000	You can see that TES is in the middle.
760000	765000	The temperature of TES depends on its material.
765000	770000	The temperature of TES depends on its material.
770000	774000	We have just mentioned the two cases.
774000	779000	We have just mentioned the two cases.
779000	783000	We want to maintain a certain temperature,
783000	787000	we want to maintain a certain temperature,.
788000	793880	The primary weak point of TES material is its thinness of silicon nitride leg.
793880	797880	This is why we call it TES Island,
797880	803880	because it is made up of four supporting legs,
803880	807880	and the fabrication is very delicate.
807880	813880	C stands for Thermal Conductance or Thermal Conductivity,
813880	817880	and Platinum Gold.
817880	821880	C stands for Heat Capacity.
821880	829880	We control the amount of Platinum Gold in the TES Island
829880	833880	to determine its heat capacity.
833880	841880	The width of the TES is 280 microns,
841880	845880	and the length is twice that,
845880	849880	560 or 600 microns.
849880	853880	It is a very tiny component.
853880	859880	We use TES to measure the CMB signal.
859880	869880	The main CMB observations are measured by TES.
869880	873880	Since 2009,
873880	877880	we have been building these experiments.
877880	881880	As time goes by,
881880	889880	there are more and more detectors on the telescope.
889880	897880	This is because our TES technology has reached a limit.
897880	903880	This means that the current TES is already in good condition.
903880	909880	How do you enhance the sensitivity of the telescope?
909880	913880	The more detectors on the telescope, the better.
913880	925880	We have used up to 3,000 or 3,000,000 detectors.
925880	943880	This is a map of Atacama Desert, Chile.
943880	949880	It is a very desolate area.
949880	957880	The sky is very clean,
957880	965880	and there is little dust.
965880	975880	We live in a 2,500-meter-high desert.
975880	983880	The act, polar bear, and Klaus are on top of the mountain.
983880	987880	The act is on the left,
987880	991880	the polar bear is on the top, and Klaus is on the bottom.
991880	995880	This mountain is about 5,200 meters high.
995880	999880	This is our act telescope.
999880	1005880	The main component of this telescope is that we have a ground screen outside,
1005880	1009880	which is about 12 meters high.
1009880	1015880	We want to reduce silo or pick up from the ground.
1015880	1019880	We built a ground screen outside our telescope.
1019880	1023880	We have a primary mirror and a secondary mirror.
1023880	1027880	The primary mirror is about 6 meters in diameter.
1027880	1031880	The secondary mirror is about 2 meters in diameter.
1031880	1037880	The resolution of the entire telescope is 1.4 seconds.
1037880	1047880	The receiver is at the tip of the arrow.
1047880	1051880	The field of view is 1 degree.
1051880	1057880	We use a dilution refrigerator,
1057880	1061880	which allows continuous operation of 100 millikelvin,
1061880	1069880	which is very important for sensitive detector functionality.
1069880	1077880	This is one of the tubes.
1077880	1081880	There are three tubes in the receiver.
1081880	1085880	From 300K, which is room temperature,
1085880	1089880	all the way down to 100 millikelvin.
1089880	1093880	My main job is to focus on the array module of 100 millikelvin.
1093880	1099880	The picture shown above is the act camera of different generations.
1099880	1107880	What did we put in the act?
1107880	1115880	In 2013, the camera in the act was called M-Vac.
1115880	1121880	I was involved in the act since 2013.
1121880	1129880	I was involved in the act since 2013.
1129880	1135880	I was involved in the act since 2013.
1135880	1141880	The central frequency of the detector is 150 GHz,
1141880	1147880	or 90 to 150 GHz.
1147880	1151880	These are all polarimeters,
1151880	1155880	which can observe two polarizations at the same time.
1155880	1161880	These are all polarimeters,
1161880	1167880	which can observe two polarizations at the same time.
1167880	1173880	M-Vac can only observe intensity.
1173880	1179880	Since the beginning of PA3,
1179880	1185880	we can observe two polarizations at the same time.
1185880	1191880	We can observe two polarizations at the same time.
1191880	1199880	We can observe two polarizations at the same time.
1199880	1205880	We can use the same pixel to double the detector count.
1205880	1211880	We can use the same pixel to double the detector count.
1211880	1217880	Since 2016, we have upgraded to Advanced Act.
1217880	1223880	Since 2016, we have upgraded to Advanced Act.

1256600	1260600	Miss Katya is a cute mouse
1260600	1262600	I have a question
1262600	1266600	I think your logo is super cute
1266600	1270600	My question is
1270600	1274600	If you have different bands
1274600	1276600	You can observe them
1276600	1278600	You can keep averaging
1278600	1280600	And the noise will get lower and lower
1280600	1282600	If you have multi-band
1282600	1284600	Can you keep reducing the noise
1284600	1286600	And increase the sensitivity?
1286600	1290600	Or will it be limited by dust?
1290600	1292600	Or will it be limited by dust?
1292600	1300600	I think it's limited by technology
1300600	1302600	That's what CMBS4 wants to do
1302600	1306600	We want to put more than
1306600	1308600	What I'm showing now
1308600	1310600	More than two-digit
1310600	1312600	More than two-digit
1312600	1314600	Detector count
1314600	1318600	They want to observe for five to ten years
1318600	1320600	They want to observe for five to ten years
1320600	1322600	The length to be observed
1322600	1324600	Has something to do with your funding source
1324600	1326600	Has something to do with your funding source
1326600	1330600	We haven't reached that limit yet
1330600	1332600	We haven't reached that limit yet
1332600	1334600	So at least
1334600	1336600	From this chart
1336600	1338600	Let's start from mid-2016
1338600	1340600	Because the Advanced AQPoL
1340600	1342600	At least it's not cut off
1342600	1344600	It's extended to the outside
1344600	1346600	So at least in the years after 2020
1346600	1348600	As long as you continue to observe
1348600	1350600	The sensitivity can keep going down
1350600	1352600	Upward
1352600	1354600	That's what it means
1354600	1356600	Thank you
1356600	1358600	But in 2021
1358600	1360600	It's supposed to be decommissioned
1366600	1368600	Now
1368600	1370600	Let's move on to
1370600	1372600	Let's move on to
1372600	1374600	The left side of the chart
1374600	1376600	The left side of the chart
1376600	1378600	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1378600	1380600	There's a little square
1380600	1382600	That's our so-called pixel
1382600	1384600	That's our so-called pixel
1384600	1386600	What's the component in this pixel?
1386600	1388600	You can see the TS I just showed
1388600	1390600	You can see the TS I just showed
1390600	1392600	The left side is called yts and xts
1392600	1394600	The left side is called yts and xts
1394600	1396600	They are measured in different polarizations
1396600	1398600	They are measured in different polarizations
1398600	1400600	How does it know
1400600	1402600	What is the accepted polarization
1402600	1404600	We use the one in the middle called
1404600	1406600	Orthomode transducer
1406600	1408600	Like a arrow
1408600	1410600	Like a arrow
1410600	1412600	Light hits
1412600	1414600	Light hits
1414600	1416600	And they go up and down
1416600	1418600	And they go up and down
1418600	1420600	And one go to the left and right direction
1420600	1422600	And they go to the left and right direction
1422600	1424600	Then there are some on-trip filters
1424600	1426600	Then there are some on-trip filters
1438600	1440600	And  sink to TS
1440600	1442600	And sink to TS
1442600	1444600	The bottoms are the channel on-trip filter
1444600	1446600	The bottoms are the channel on-trip filter
1462600	1464600	You can separate by 2 pixel
1464600	1466600	You can separate by 2 pixel

1476600	1478600	The number left 4tx
1478600	1480600	The number left 150 Ghz
1480600	1482600	The number left 90 GHz
1482600	1484600	The number left 90 Ghz
1484600	1486600	The number left 90 Ghz
1486600	1488600	The number left Google Sachan
1490600	1494600	The numbers on the right
1494600	1496600	The numbers on the left
1496600	1500600	Size is different
1500600	1502600	I have a question
1502600	1504600	Usually your bandwidth is how many?
1510600	1512600	I think it's
1512600	1514600	False 20
1520600	1522600	Yes, so it's the bandwidth
1522600	1526600	We will design the bandwidth
1526600	1530600	Don't go to 0.2 line or 0.2 line
1530600	1534600	That's what we want to avoid
1534600	1538600	We can control our bandwidth
1540600	1544600	2.30 is on a 0.2 line
1546600	1550600	Yes, but we didn't avoid it
1550600	1552600	Our design is 2.20
1552600	1554600	So the bandwidth is super narrow
1554600	1558600	20 is 1.50 or 1.90
1558600	1560600	They might have more error
1564600	1566600	So on-chip filter
1566600	1568600	I will talk about it later
1568600	1570600	On-chip filter is important
1570600	1578600	Because it controls the most precise bandwidth
1578600	1580600	Like our VHORN
1580600	1582600	And some optics
1582600	1584600	To control other bands
1584600	1588600	So after the optical design
1588600	1590600	We will make sure it doesn't cross
1590600	1592600	The side region we don't want
1598600	1600600	Here you can see
1600600	1602600	The right one
1602600	1604600	The OMT size is only 1.3
1604600	1606600	And the left one
1606600	1608600	The OMT size is 2mm
1608600	1610600	So you might think
1610600	1612600	What does it matter
1612600	1614600	Well
1614600	1616600	OMT is a film
1616600	1618600	A film
1618600	1620600	The circle part
1620600	1622600	Is transparent
1622600	1624600	It's a very thin film
1624600	1626600	And this film
1626600	1628600	Is like a metal
1628600	1630600	On the film
1630600	1632600	So you need to control
1632600	1634600	The film
1634600	1636600	On 1.3mm
1636600	1638600	You can imagine
1638600	1640600	How hard it is
1640600	1642600	To grow the film
1642600	1644600	On a 6-inch wafer
1644600	1646600	Or 4-inch wafer
1646600	1648600	It's not easy
1652600	1654600	The left one
1654600	1656600	Is the first generation
1656600	1658600	Pixel
1658600	1660600	And the second generation
1660600	1662600	On the wafer
1664600	1666600	Our wafer
1666600	1668600	Is 3-inch
1668600	1670600	75mm
1670600	1672600	Now we move the technique
1672600	1674600	To 6-inch
1674600	1676600	Wafer
1676600	1678600	We want to
1678600	1680600	Closely packed
1680600	1682600	Pixels on the wafer
1682600	1684600	So you can see
1684600	1686600	Instead of a square packed
1686600	1688600	Square design
1688600	1690600	We have a
1690600	1692600	Rhombus
1692600	1694600	Rhombus
1694600	1696600	Pixel design
1696600	1698600	So we can put more
1698600	1700600	Detectors on it
1700600	1702600	And
1702600	1704600	The left one
1704600	1706600	3-inch
1706600	1708600	Wafer
1708600	1710600	We can only put
1710600	1712600	244 channels
1712600	1714600	But the 150mm
1714600	1716600	6-inch wafer
1716600	1718600	We can read out
1718600	1720600	More than 2000 channels
1720600	1722600	One channel is one TES
1722600	1724600	So you can see
1724600	1726600	Double the size
1726600	1728600	We want to
1728600	1730600	Push the sensitivity
1730600	1732600	So we have to
1732600	1734600	Put more detectors
1734600	1736600	On the fixed focal plane
1736600	1738600	This is what I just said
1738600	1740600	Detectors
1740600	1742600	In addition to on-chip filter
1742600	1744600	The OMT
1744600	1746600	OMT is
1746600	1748600	Under the right image
1748600	1750600	OMT couple detector
1750600	1752600	It couple to
1752600	1754600	Feehorn
1754600	1756600	Feehorn
1756600	1758600	It's a cone-shaped
1758600	1760600	It can control
1760600	1762600	Your light path
1762600	1764600	From the top
1764600	1766600	To the OMT
1766600	1768600	You don't want
1768600	1770600	The light go through the OMT
1770600	1772600	You want to
1772600	1774600	Make best use of
1774600	1776600	The light source
1776600	1778600	So you have to put a
1778600	1780600	Facture
1780600	1782600	Like a cover
1782600	1784600	To make sure
1784600	1786600	The light will not
1786600	1788600	Go through the OMT
1788600	1790600	And make extra noise
1790600	1792600	To your signal
1792600	1794600	All of these
1794600	1796600	Are made out of
1796600	1798600	Silicon
1798600	1800600	The horn array
1800600	1802600	We take
1802600	1804600	500 microns
1804600	1806600	Wafers
1806600	1808600	And we use
1808600	1810600	Three
1810600	1812600	Three edges
1812600	1814600	To make a circle
1814600	1816600	And
1816600	1818600	Each layer
1818600	1820600	Has a circle size
1820600	1822600	We call it silicon horn array
1822600	1824600	The main reason
1824600	1826600	To use silicon
1826600	1828600	Is to make a thermal match
1828600	1830600	With the detector wafer
1830600	1832600	We want to make sure
1832600	1834600	There won't be any thermal
1834600	1836600	Contraction issue
1836600	1838600	And make the detector break
1838600	1840600	So
1842600	1844600	This picture is
1844600	1846600	To show
1846600	1848600	How to read out
1848600	1850600	With detector array
1850600	1852600	And
1852600	1854600	It's not
1854600	1856600	About reading out
1856600	1858600	But
1858600	1860600	About
1860600	1862600	How cumbersome
1862600	1864600	The assembly is
1868600	1870600	So we have a detector wafer
1870600	1872600	And we put it
1872600	1874600	On a base
1874600	1876600	And we need to
1876600	1878600	Do a lot of
1878600	1880600	Wire bond
1880600	1882600	To make a connection
1882600	1884600	To
1884600	1886600	Silicon component
1886600	1888600	So we can connect it
1888600	1890600	To
1890600	1892600	100mC stage
1892600	1894600	So we need to
1894600	1896600	Push it layer by layer
1896600	1898600	To 1k, 4k, 40k
1898600	1900600	And
1900600	1902600	Eventually to room temperature
1902600	1904600	So
1904600	1906600	It usually
1906600	1908600	Takes about
1908600	1910600	A year
1910600	1912600	To make an array
1912600	1914600	On the left
1914600	1916600	Is the array
1916600	1918600	And on the right
1918600	1920600	Is the advanced array
1920600	1922600	And
1922600	1924600	For Ack
1924600	1926600	The average time
1926600	1928600	To make an array
1928600	1930600	Is about a year
1930600	1932600	Usually
1932600	1934600	You will
1934600	1936600	Start the next
1936600	1938600	Array assembly
1938600	1940600	And
1940600	1942600	At the same time
1942600	1944600	You can put it
1944600	1946600	On the base
1946600	1948600	So
1948600	1950600	In summary
1950600	1952600	We have
1952600	1954600	PA1 and PA2
1954600	1956600	We have
1956600	1958600	1000 TS detector
1958600	1960600	PA3 has 1000 TS detector
1960600	1962600	But
1964600	1966600	PA1 and
1966600	1968600	PA2 have 1000 TS detector
1968600	1970600	PA3 has 1000 TS detector
1970600	1972600	And
1972600	1974600	For EO
1974600	1976600	The more you know
1976600	1978600	The more time you spend
1978600	1980600	And the more you learn
1980600	1982600	So it's bad at first
1982600	1984600	But it gets better
1984600	1986600	50%, 70%, 80%
1986600	1988600	And
1988600	1990600	For
1990600	1992600	Advanced Ack
1992600	1994600	PA4
1994600	1996600	HF array
1996600	1998600	HF array is
1998600	2000600	220GHz and
2000600	2002600	150GHz
2002600	2004600	And
2004600	2006600	HF array
2006600	2008600	Has 2000 TS
2008600	2010600	And
2010600	2012600	MF array
2012600	2014600	Has 90GHz and
2014600	2016600	150GHz
2016600	2018600	And
2018600	2020600	MF array
2020600	2022600	Has 1700 TS
2022600	2024600	And
2024600	2026600	It's
2026600	2028600	Improved
2028600	2030600	For EO
2030600	2032600	The same result
2032600	2034600	For PA4
2034600	2036600	70%
2036600	2038600	For PA6
2038600	2040600	90%
2040600	2042600	And
2042600	2044600	For EO
2044600	2046600	For TS
2046600	2048600	Sensitivity
2048600	2050600	If the array
2050600	2052600	Is only 50%
2052600	2054600	You have to
2054600	2056600	Observe
2056600	2058600	The device
2058600	2060600	Or
2060600	2062600	Put the same array
2062600	2064600	To get the same sensitivity
2064600	2066600	So we want to
2066600	2068600	Achieve 100% EO
2068600	2070600	But for CMB
2070600	2072600	Camera
2072600	2074600	This is
2074600	2076600	The best
2076600	2078600	I haven't heard of
2078600	2080600	95%
2080600	2082600	I have a question
2082600	2084600	What is
2084600	2086600	The main problem
2086600	2088600	For EO
2088600	2090600	Wirebond?
2090600	2092600	Mainly for wirebond
2092600	2094600	And
2094600	2096600	Readout
2096600	2098600	Readout component
2098600	2100600	It's hard to fabricate
2100600	2102600	It needs
2102600	2104600	Many steps
2104600	2106600	So usually
2106600	2108600	For EO
2108600	2110600	And
2110600	2112600	For readout
2112600	2114600	It's a problem
2114600	2116600	You can see
2116600	2118600	Interconnect
2118600	2120600	Flexible cables
2120600	2122600	And
2122600	2124600	Usually
2124600	2126600	Wirebond
2126600	2128600	To
2128600	2130600	Detector
2130600	2132600	Or readout
2132600	2134600	The failure
2134600	2136600	Contribute
2136600	2138600	Thank you
2138600	2140600	So
2140600	2142600	Your squid
2142600	2144600	Is made by NIST?
2144600	2146600	Our squid is made by NIST
2146600	2148600	I see, thank you
2148600	2150600	I haven't mentioned
2150600	2152600	Readout
2152600	2154600	It's another in our talk
2154600	2156600	But our app
2156600	2158600	Mainly uses TDM
2158600	2160600	Time domain multiplexing
2160600	2162600	I haven't mentioned multiplexing
2162600	2164600	But
2164600	2166600	With so many detectors
2166600	2168600	It's impossible to readout
2168600	2170600	So we need to do multiplexing
2170600	2172600	You need to group
2172600	2174600	Some detectors
2174600	2176600	And readout
2176600	2178600	To
2178600	2180600	Speed up
2180600	2182600	Data speed
2182600	2184600	The last
2184600	2186600	LF array
2186600	2188600	Will be released in January
2188600	2190600	This array
2190600	2192600	Is challenging
2192600	2194600	You can see
2194600	2196600	The same wave
2196600	2198600	But not many pixels
2198600	2200600	And each
2200600	2202600	OMT
2202600	2204600	Let me see
2204600	2206600	Every OMT
2206600	2208600	Is much bigger
2208600	2210600	Compared with
2210600	2212600	MF and HF
2212600	2214600	About 1 cm
2214600	2216600	As i said
2216600	2218600	The transparent part
2218600	2220600	Is membrane
2220600	2222600	This membrane
2222600	2224600	Distress
2224600	2226600	And metal
2226600	2228600	It's a
2228600	2230600	Difficult technology
2230600	2232600	So
2232600	2234600	It's challenging
2234600	2236600	In R&D
2236600	2238600	But we made it
2238600	2240600	And
2240600	2242600	Initial testing result
2242600	2244600	Is reasonable
2244600	2246600	We will release it in January
2246600	2248600	Hopefully
2248600	2250600	I see some light
2252600	2254600	The next one
2254600	2256600	Is Simon's Observatory
2256600	2258600	I was talking about
2258600	2260600	Act
2260600	2262600	Our new plan
2262600	2264600	Is to build
2264600	2266600	A new observatory
2266600	2268600	Next to Act
2270600	2272600	This observatory
2272600	2274600	Is mainly
2274600	2276600	Composed by
2276600	2278600	On the right
2278600	2280600	We call it
2280600	2282600	Large Aperture Telescope
2282600	2284600	L-A-T
2284600	2286600	It's a 6m cross-dragon
2286600	2288600	Telescope
2290600	2292600	L-A-T
2292600	2294600	Let us see
2294600	2296600	Small-scale signal
2296600	2298600	Act is sensitive
2298600	2300600	To the power spectrum
2300600	2302600	L is greater than 200
2302600	2304600	To
2304600	2306600	Above
2306600	2308600	The power spectrum
2308600	2310600	So
2310600	2312600	Usually
2312600	2314600	You want to build it bigger and bigger
2314600	2316600	So
2316600	2318600	So
2318600	2320600	And
2320600	2322600	It's limited by technology
2322600	2324600	So
2324600	2326600	This telescope
2326600	2328600	Is designed
2328600	2330600	13 optics tubes
2330600	2332600	But
2332600	2334600	We will only put
2334600	2336600	7 tubes
2336600	2338600	And each tube
2338600	2340600	Will have 3
2340600	2342600	6-inch detector
2342600	2344600	Array
2344600	2346600	So
2346600	2348600	The receiver
2348600	2350600	Will have 21 detector array
2350600	2352600	Compare to Act
2352600	2354600	Act has 3, L has 21
2354600	2356600	This
2356600	2358600	Observatory
2358600	2360600	Is a giant
2360600	2362600	2.8m
2362600	2364600	In length
2364600	2366600	The whole
2366600	2368600	Platform
2368600	2370600	Has
2370600	2372600	About 15m
2372600	2374600	Height
2374600	2376600	Another small aperture telescope
2376600	2378600	We call it S-A-T
2378600	2380600	Sensitive to L below 200
2380600	2382600	Like
2382600	2384600	Bicep
2384600	2386600	Polar bear array
2386600	2388600	Mainly
2388600	2390600	Focusing on
2390600	2392600	Primordial BMO
2392600	2394600	The mirror is
2394600	2396600	0.5m
2396600	2398600	And
2398600	2400600	Baseline is
2400600	2402600	3 S-A-T
2402600	2404600	Each S-A-T
2404600	2406600	Can have 7 array
2406600	2408600	So
2408600	2410600	About 21
2410600	2412600	Detector
2412600	2414600	With funding
2414600	2416600	4 S-A-T
2416600	2418600	28 detector
2418600	2420600	So
2422600	2424600	The total
2424600	2426600	Detector count
2426600	2428600	We have
2428600	2430600	2 technologies
2430600	2432600	And we will
2432600	2434600	Deploy
2434600	2436600	The first
2436600	2438600	NIST
2438600	2440600	NIST
2440600	2442600	MF
2442600	2444600	UHF
2444600	2446600	And
2446600	2448600	220 and 270 GHz
2448600	2450600	So
2450600	2452600	NIST will focus on
2452600	2454600	These two
2454600	2456600	Detector type
2456600	2458600	Another
2458600	2460600	Berkeley
2460600	2462600	They will
2462600	2464600	Do another array
2464600	2466600	Their
2466600	2468600	Central frequency sensitive to
2468600	2470600	30 to 40 GHz
2470600	2472600	This is another technology
2472600	2474600	The same
2474600	2476600	TS technology
2476600	2478600	In total
2478600	2480600	It will have
2480600	2482600	60,000 TS
2482600	2484600	Barometer
2484600	2486600	When we deploy
2486600	2488600	60,000 TS
2488600	2490600	Barometer
2490600	2492600	So
2492600	2494600	Magnitude
2494600	2496600	More than
2496600	2498600	At
2498600	2500600	So
2500600	2502600	This is
2502600	2504600	Summary
2504600	2506600	Assignment of
2506600	2508600	Plan
2508600	2510600	Supposedly
2510600	2512600	We want to deploy S-A-T
2512600	2514600	Next year
2514600	2516600	Sometime
2516600	2518600	Then
2518600	2520600	Then
2520600	2522600	Deploy
2522600	2524600	The rest
2524600	2526600	S-A-T
2526600	2528600	And
2528600	2530600	Populate
2530600	2532600	S-A-T optics
2532600	2534600	So
2534600	2536600	This is
2536600	2538600	My role in assignment
2538600	2540600	Mainly
2540600	2542600	Scheduling
2542600	2544600	Besides
2544600	2546600	The detector and readout
2546600	2548600	Plan
2548600	2550600	So
2550600	2552600	Today's talk
2552600	2554600	Ends here
2554600	2556600	Thank you
2556600	2558600	Yama
2560600	2562600	Any questions?
2562600	2564600	Let's
2564600	2566600	Turn on the mic
2566600	2568600	So the speaker can hear
2568600	2570600	Applause
2570600	2572600	Thank you
2572600	2574600	For the wonderful talk
2574600	2576600	Then
2576600	2578600	Before Q&A
2578600	2580600	I want to say
2580600	2582600	This is so cute
2582600	2584600	There is no such cute logo in the lab
2584600	2586600	And this
2586600	2588600	OK
2588600	2590600	Any questions?
2592600	2594600	I have a question
2594600	2596600	That
2596600	2598600	The new array
2598600	2600600	It is
2600600	2602600	Work independently
2602600	2604600	Interferometry
2604600	2606600	It is
2606600	2608600	Uh
2608600	2610600	In
2610600	2612600	Uh
2612600	2614600	Uh
2614600	2616600	Our array does not work independently
2616600	2618600	They are
2618600	2620600	Scanned at the same time
2620600	2622600	Yes
2622600	2624600	Will you do
2624600	2626600	Interferometry
2626600	2628600	There are three telescopes
2628600	2630600	Coordinate observation
2630600	2632600	But
2632600	2634600	They can cross-check
2634600	2636600	We will cross-check
2636600	2638600	You
2638600	2640600	If they see the same sky
2640600	2642600	Then
2642600	2644600	We will cross-check
2644600	2646600	Make sure
2646600	2648600	No systematics
2648600	2650600	We build
2650600	2652600	So many small
2652600	2654600	At the same time
2654600	2656600	Not a bigger
2656600	2658600	Or something
2658600	2660600	You can
2660600	2662600	Remove the systematics
2662600	2664600	Which is really big
2664600	2666600	Telescope
2666600	2668600	So
2668600	2670600	There is no way to make it
2670600	2672600	Like a
2672600	2674600	Baseline
2674600	2676600	Baseline
2676600	2678600	There should be two baselines
2678600	2680600	At least you can
2680600	2682600	I don't know if resolution is important to you
2686600	2688600	I think you can use some techniques
2688600	2690600	But I think
2690600	2692600	Idea should be different from interferometry
2692600	2694600	OK
2694600	2696600	Every time
2696600	2698600	What time scale
2698600	2700600	Time
2700600	2702600	Uh
2702600	2704600	Every integration
2704600	2706600	How long
2706600	2708600	Very fast
2708600	2710600	I forgot
2710600	2712600	Anyway, it's fast
2712600	2714600	There may be no way to do this
2714600	2716600	You
2716600	2718600	You usually don't see time
2718600	2720600	Interference
2720600	2722600	There may be some interference
2722600	2724600	OK
2726600	2728600	Then
2728600	2730600	This picture
2730600	2732600	The reason why it's so far
2732600	2734600	And every thing has a show
2734600	2736600	Don't want to be affected by others
2736600	2738600	Because
2738600	2740600	If you hit this
2740600	2742600	Then hit another panel
2742600	2744600	Um
2746600	2748600	Then I ask another question
2748600	2750600	OK
2750600	2752600	Is
2752600	2754600	In the end
2754600	2756600	These things need
2756600	2758600	Because generally speaking
2758600	2760600	In traditional astronomical observation
2760600	2762600	You want better reflectivity
2762600	2764600	Make the mirror bigger
2764600	2766600	Then make the detector bigger
2766600	2768600	There is a bigger field of view
2768600	2770600	But I see you
2770600	2772600	Still a few meters
2772600	2774600	That is
2774600	2776600	What is the reason
2776600	2778600	Because now
2778600	2780600	It's easy to do
2780600	2782600	12 meters or even 20 meters
2782600	2784600	There should be no problem
2784600	2786600	That
2786600	2788600	Detector size can't follow
2788600	2790600	What is the reason
2790600	2792600	Go up
2792600	2794600	Bigger
2794600	2796600	We are
2796600	2798600	I want to be smaller
2798600	2800600	But the area
2800600	2802600	No, the area should be bigger
2802600	2804600	Should not say detector
2804600	2806600	The field of view is mainly
2806600	2808600	The size of the focal plane
2808600	2810600	The focal plane is the population
2810600	2812600	You have a focal plane
2812600	2814600	How many detectors are there
2814600	2816600	Yes
2816600	2818600	You should be talking about
2818600	2820600	The bigger the focal plane
2820600	2822600	How many inside
2822600	2824600	The bigger you do
2824600	2826600	The more detectors inside
2826600	2828600	Increase the field of view
2828600	2830600	But
2830600	2832600	We are mainly limited by
2832600	2834600	We just want to do this
2834600	2836600	2.8 meters long
2836600	2838600	Receiver
2838600	2840600	It's already big
2840600	2842600	Every stage is already big
2842600	2844600	Because we have to cool down
2844600	2846600	To 100 millikelvin
2846600	2848600	Cryogenic technology is very strong
2848600	2850600	Then you
2850600	2852600	We need a lot of pulse tube
2852600	2854600	And dilution fridge
2856600	2858600	Our pump
2858600	2860600	May need more
2860600	2862600	And just imagine
2862600	2864600	You this
2864600	2866600	300k
2866600	2868600	Window
2868600	2870600	At first we thought
2870600	2872600	Can we find such a big window
2872600	2874600	Or every individual
2874600	2876600	Optics tube
2876600	2878600	Have your own shape
2878600	2880600	That material
2880600	2882600	It's hard to control
2882600	2884600	Hard to go
2884600	2886600	And every stage
2886600	2888600	We have filters
2888600	2890600	Define the low pass band
2890600	2892600	That filter
2892600	2894600	Size is also a problem
2894600	2896600	I don't think
2896600	2898600	We are not
2898600	2900600	Current ground base
2900600	2902600	The biggest mirror is SPT
2902600	2904600	They did 10 meters
2904600	2906600	Yes
2906600	2908600	But consider
2908600	2910600	All kinds of technology
2910600	2912600	And efficiency
2912600	2914600	The final decision is
2914600	2916600	Choose 6 meters
2916600	2918600	Then
2922600	2924600	Any questions?
2924600	2926600	I have two questions
2926600	2928600	The first question is
2928600	2930600	Your wafer
2930600	2932600	Back short
2932600	2934600	You said it's silicon
2934600	2936600	Is it pure silicon?
2936600	2938600	Or you have etched
2938600	2940600	My question is
2940600	2942600	Back short
2942600	2944600	The top
2944600	2946600	It's a flat surface
2946600	2948600	It's a
2948600	2950600	Pure silicon
2950600	2952600	There is a
2952600	2954600	Back short cavity
2954600	2956600	You can see
2956600	2958600	It's magnified
2958600	2960600	It has a groove
2960600	2962600	It has
2962600	2964600	It has
2964600	2966600	Feature
2966600	2968600	It covers
2968600	2970600	TS
2970600	2972600	It won't see
2972600	2974600	Light leak
2974600	2976600	From other TS
2976600	2978600	It covers TS
2978600	2980600	It has
2980600	2982600	Some design
2982600	2984600	Determine
2984600	2986600	We can
2986600	2988600	Obtain all light
2988600	2990600	But won't let TS
2990600	2992600	Contaminated
2992600	2994600	No cross talk
2994600	2996600	I see
2996600	2998600	It's like
2998600	3000600	Blocking
3000600	3002600	We'll
3002600	3004600	Back it
3004600	3006600	We'll use
3006600	3008600	Sidecast
3008600	3010600	Ok
3010600	3012600	I see
3012600	3014600	So
3014600	3016600	It's purpose
3016600	3018600	You're a barometer
