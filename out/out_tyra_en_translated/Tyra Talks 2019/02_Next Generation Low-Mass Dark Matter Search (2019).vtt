which aims to measure dark matter.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
which aims to measure dark matter.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
which aims to measure dark matter.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
which aims to measured dark matter.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
which aims to measured dark matter.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
which aims to measured dark matter.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Ms. Zhang is currently working on SuperCDMS at Caltech,

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
which aims to measured dark matter.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
What I mean is there are 30 spectrums in this list

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
There is a difference between the expected and predicted mass by GRAVITY

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
There is a difference between the expected and predicted mass by GRAVITY

07:06.000 --> 07:09.380
When it is

07:09.380 --> 07:14.380
close to about the galaxy,

07:14.380 --> 07:17.380
the material is able to spin faster than the prescribed velocity

07:17.380 --> 07:20.380
when it is close to about the galaxy,

07:20.380 --> 07:23.380
the material is able to spin faster than the prescribed velocity

07:23.380 --> 07:26.580
This means when it

07:26.580 --> 07:29.580
is close to the galaxy, the force is much greater than the expected force

07:29.580 --> 07:32.580
when it is close to the galaxy, the force is much greater than the expected force

07:32.580 --> 07:35.580
It is able to maintain the orbit faster

07:35.580 --> 07:38.580
It is able to maintain the orbit faster

07:38.580 --> 07:41.580
If you have any questions, just ask directly

07:41.580 --> 07:44.580
Sometimes, there are some confusion

07:44.580 --> 07:47.580
Is this uncertainty too blue?

07:47.580 --> 07:50.580
Is this uncertainty too blue?

07:50.580 --> 07:53.580
It looks like the blue line is very strong

07:53.580 --> 07:56.580
The blue line indicates that it should look like this

07:56.580 --> 07:59.580
The blue line indicates that it should look like this

07:59.580 --> 08:02.580
The blue line indicates that it should look like this

08:02.580 --> 08:05.580
And the red line indicates that it probably grows like this

08:05.580 --> 08:08.580
But it says that the measurement allows to accurately measure if any location

08:08.580 --> 08:11.580
But it says that the measurement allows to accurately measure if any location

08:11.580 --> 08:14.580
can measure the distance between the crucible, solar system's velocity

08:14.580 --> 08:17.580
can measure the distance between the crucible, solar system's velocity

08:17.580 --> 08:20.580
each média indicates very low uncertainty

08:20.580 --> 08:23.580
each média indicates very low uncertainty

08:23.580 --> 08:26.580
each média indicates very low uncertainty

08:26.580 --> 08:29.580
Okay, so this should be very accurate

08:29.580 --> 08:32.580
Okay, so this should be very accurate

08:32.580 --> 08:35.580
Okay, so we know that

08:35.580 --> 08:38.580
We found out that these planets rotate

08:38.580 --> 08:41.580
Can I ask a question?

08:41.580 --> 08:44.580
So you mean all the black lines are pretty accurate

08:44.580 --> 08:47.580
So you mean all the black lines are pretty accurate

08:47.580 --> 08:50.580
The masses are not the same

08:50.580 --> 08:53.580
The distribution is not the same

08:53.580 --> 08:56.580
So you can imagine that there are 31 sets of blue and red lines

08:56.580 --> 08:59.580
So you can imagine that there are 31 sets of blue and red lines

08:59.580 --> 09:02.580
I just want to emphasize that it is getting more and more obvious when you get close to the periphery

09:02.580 --> 09:05.580
It's too fast

09:05.580 --> 09:08.580
It's so fast that it's weird

09:08.580 --> 09:11.580
So at this time

09:11.580 --> 09:14.580
You see this person called Vicky

09:15.580 --> 09:18.580
He noticed this when he was observing the Small Magellanic Orbit

09:18.580 --> 09:21.580
He noticed this when he was observing the Small Magellanic Orbit

09:21.580 --> 09:24.580
So he is the first to propose this

09:24.580 --> 09:27.580
So there is actually a blue light cloud

09:27.580 --> 09:30.580
So there is actually a blue light cloud

09:30.580 --> 09:33.580
I draw it up to tell you that there is something there

09:33.580 --> 09:36.580
But in fact you can't see the blue light

09:36.580 --> 09:39.580
There is a black hole, a light cloud

09:39.580 --> 09:42.580
Dark matter

09:42.580 --> 09:45.580
It is a mass

09:45.580 --> 09:48.580
It is also radiating gravity

09:48.580 --> 09:51.580
It is also radiating gravity

09:51.580 --> 09:54.580
These things are symmetrical

09:54.580 --> 09:57.580
Many people did not believe it until it was proposed

09:57.580 --> 10:00.580
Many people did not believe it until it was proposed

10:00.580 --> 10:03.580
Vera Rubin did a very careful measurement

10:03.580 --> 10:06.580
For many galaxies

10:06.580 --> 10:09.580
This is a typical example

10:09.580 --> 10:12.580
We can observe what we see

10:12.580 --> 10:15.580
Its behavior

10:15.580 --> 10:18.580
How much gravity affects it

10:18.580 --> 10:21.580
Then we can see what can radiate gravity

10:21.580 --> 10:24.580
How much can we really see

10:24.580 --> 10:27.580
Then we compare the difference

10:27.580 --> 10:30.580
Then we find that there is a part of the mass that we can't see

10:30.580 --> 10:33.580
This is easier to understand

10:33.580 --> 10:36.580
But in fact, dark matter has a lot of

10:36.580 --> 10:39.580
There are a lot of different scales

10:39.580 --> 10:42.580
It can be attributed to dark matter

10:42.580 --> 10:45.580
It can be attributed to dark matter

10:45.580 --> 10:48.580
What you see in the upper left corner

10:48.580 --> 10:51.580
Is the rotation curve

10:51.580 --> 10:54.580
Second, what you see in the upper right corner

10:54.580 --> 10:57.580
All the light spots are a galaxy cluster

10:57.580 --> 11:00.580
All the light spots are a galaxy cluster

11:00.580 --> 11:03.580
In other words, that a light spot

11:03.580 --> 11:06.580
There are so many galaxies

11:06.580 --> 11:09.580
It looks like a big universe

11:09.580 --> 11:12.580
It looks like a big universe

11:12.580 --> 11:15.580
This is a simulation

11:15.580 --> 11:18.580
The black part is dark matter

11:18.580 --> 11:21.580
It makes the background of the universe white

11:21.580 --> 11:24.580
If there is no dark matter in the universe

11:24.580 --> 11:27.580
In this simulation

11:27.580 --> 11:30.580
There is no way to form enough gravity to attract the matter

11:30.580 --> 11:33.580
It is not heavy enough

11:33.580 --> 11:36.580
It is not heavy enough

11:36.580 --> 11:39.580
So there are a lot of dark matter

11:39.580 --> 11:42.580
It is closer to the cosmic web

11:42.580 --> 11:45.580
It is closer to the cosmic web

11:45.580 --> 11:48.580
Then the gravity will quickly suck in the visible matter

11:48.580 --> 11:51.580
So dark matter can be explained well

11:51.580 --> 11:54.580
If you look at the lower left corner

11:54.580 --> 11:57.580
First, I want to say that the blue light cloud and the red light cloud in the lower left corner are added

11:57.580 --> 12:00.580
The blue light cloud and the red light cloud in the lower left corner are added

12:00.580 --> 12:03.580
There are not seen

12:03.580 --> 12:06.580
Do you see the red part?

12:06.580 --> 12:09.300
It means that it has observed X-ray emission

12:09.300 --> 12:12.300
Do you see the blue part?

12:12.300 --> 12:15.440
It means that it has observed X-ray emission

12:15.440 --> 12:18.340
It is under the effect of limited sunlight

12:18.340 --> 12:21.340
It is under the effect of limited sunlight

12:21.340 --> 12:24.460
The equivalent effect of GANS

12:24.460 --> 12:27.480
It is the opposite of GANS

12:27.560 --> 12:30.440
The blue parts on two sides are soaked with GANS

12:30.440 --> 12:33.460
The red parts are soaked with X-ray emission

12:33.460 --> 12:36.380
The red parts are soaked with X-ray emission

12:36.560 --> 12:39.240
In this graph, the two galaxy clusters clash

12:39.240 --> 12:42.060
In this graph, the two galaxy clusters clash

12:44.660 --> 12:47.860
When they clash, the 2 clusters pass

12:48.620 --> 12:51.520
We know that when these clusters collide

12:51.520 --> 12:54.500
The closest cluster will generate X-ray

12:54.500 --> 12:55.760
The closest cluster will generate X-ray

12:56.040 --> 12:58.820
They look like two sprays of water

12:58.820 --> 13:01.820
They look like two sprays of water

13:01.880 --> 13:04.720
But there are two masses

13:04.720 --> 13:05.720
But there are two masses

13:05.720 --> 13:08.720
They run far away

13:08.720 --> 13:10.220
They don't interact

13:10.680 --> 13:13.680
They don't interact with the matter we know

13:13.680 --> 13:17.180
They don't interact with the matter we know

13:19.080 --> 13:21.680
This is called a Bully Cluster

13:21.720 --> 13:25.040
This can also give a very strong constraint

13:25.140 --> 13:28.140
It is massive and it doesn't work

13:28.140 --> 13:30.140
In the lower left corner

13:30.500 --> 13:32.840
In the lower left corner

13:32.900 --> 13:36.220
We can see the light blue and green

13:36.220 --> 13:39.220
We can see the light blue and green

13:39.220 --> 13:42.220
This is our galaxy

13:42.220 --> 13:45.220
If we observe from the earth

13:45.220 --> 13:48.220
This is the background of the universe

13:48.220 --> 13:51.220
This is the background of the universe

13:51.220 --> 13:54.220
The red part is hot, the blue part is cold

13:54.400 --> 13:57.400
This is the radiation of the universe

13:57.400 --> 14:00.400
The red part is hot, the blue part is cold

14:00.400 --> 14:03.400
If I make this galaxy

14:03.400 --> 14:06.400
If I make this galaxy

14:06.400 --> 14:09.400
2D Fourier Transform

14:09.400 --> 14:12.400
You can see the shape of the light bulb

14:12.400 --> 14:15.400
You can see the shape of the light bulb

14:15.400 --> 14:18.400
90 degrees, 18 degrees, 1 degree

14:18.400 --> 14:21.400
90 degrees, 18 degrees, 1 degree

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
0.2, 0.1, 0.07

14:22.580 --> 14:25.580
What is the axis of gravity

14:25.580 --> 14:28.580
Correlation

14:28.580 --> 14:31.580
The heat is directly related between the two points

14:31.580 --> 14:34.580
The heat is directly related between the two points

14:34.580 --> 14:37.580
The heat is directly related between the two points

14:37.580 --> 14:40.580
The chance is basically this

14:40.580 --> 14:43.580
In other words, this blue and green

14:43.580 --> 14:46.580
In other words, this blue and green

14:46.580 --> 14:49.580
At about 1 degree

14:49.580 --> 14:52.580
Or 0.7 degrees or 0.5 degrees

14:52.580 --> 14:55.580
Or 0.7 degrees or 0.5 degrees

14:55.580 --> 14:58.580
So its density will mainly appear at these angles

14:58.580 --> 15:01.580
So its density will mainly appear at these angles

15:01.580 --> 15:04.580
This is very interesting

15:04.580 --> 15:07.580
We first have to ask how the universe's background radiation is produced

15:07.580 --> 15:10.580
The background radiation of the universe is in the very distant early universe

15:10.580 --> 15:13.580
The background radiation of the universe is in the very distant early universe

15:13.580 --> 15:16.580
When these lights are no longer with the very chaotic matter in the universe

15:16.580 --> 15:19.580
When these lights are no longer with the very chaotic matter in the universe

15:19.580 --> 15:22.580
After the Big Bang

15:22.580 --> 15:25.580
It recorded the temperature of that location

15:25.580 --> 15:28.580
What is the temperature

15:28.580 --> 15:31.580
Temperature is the density of the location

15:31.580 --> 15:34.580
Because the higher the density, the greater the pressure

15:34.580 --> 15:37.580
The higher the temperature, the more heat, the more radiation

15:37.580 --> 15:40.580
So we observe the distribution of the CMB map

15:40.580 --> 15:43.580
So we observe the distribution of the CMB map

15:43.580 --> 15:46.580
How is the quality distributed in the universe

15:46.580 --> 15:49.580
How is the quality distributed in the universe

15:49.580 --> 15:52.580
We can find one thing from this

15:52.580 --> 15:55.580
To be so closely distributed

15:55.580 --> 15:58.580
Like you see this spectrum

15:58.580 --> 16:01.580
If only the quality in the universe we see now is not enough

16:01.580 --> 16:04.580
If only the quality in the universe we see now is not enough

16:04.580 --> 16:07.580
We need more quality

16:07.580 --> 16:10.580
They will first be crowded together because of gravity

16:10.580 --> 16:13.580
They will first be crowded together because of gravity

16:13.580 --> 16:16.580
Then their gravity will help lighter matter

16:16.580 --> 16:19.580
Then their gravity will help lighter matter

16:19.580 --> 16:22.580
It's like a right-hand corner map

16:22.580 --> 16:25.580
It's like a right-hand corner map

16:25.580 --> 16:28.580
The story is very similar

16:28.580 --> 16:31.580
If only the matter we see is not heavy enough

16:31.580 --> 16:34.580
To form the CMB map

16:34.580 --> 16:37.580
To form the CMB map

16:37.580 --> 16:40.580
Here we can tell us

16:40.580 --> 16:43.580
There are many observations in the universe

16:43.580 --> 16:46.580
There are many observations in the universe

16:46.580 --> 16:49.580
The observed matter physics is basically particle physics

16:49.580 --> 16:52.580
It's not consistent with gravity

16:52.580 --> 16:55.580
It's not consistent with gravity

16:55.580 --> 16:58.580
A good direction is to think

16:58.580 --> 17:01.580
Some things in our model have mass

17:01.580 --> 17:04.580
Some things in our model have mass

17:04.580 --> 17:07.580
We can explain it

17:07.580 --> 17:10.580
This is dark matter

17:10.580 --> 17:13.580
I will stop here

17:13.580 --> 17:16.580
Do you have any questions?

17:16.580 --> 17:19.580
It will be more technical

17:19.580 --> 17:22.580
It will be more technical

17:22.580 --> 17:25.580
Do you have any questions?

17:25.580 --> 17:28.580
You can ask a difficult question

17:28.580 --> 17:31.580
I want to ask a simple question

17:31.580 --> 17:34.580
I want to ask a simple question

17:34.580 --> 17:37.580
I want to ask a simple question

17:37.580 --> 17:40.580
Do you know about the Fermi Law?

17:40.580 --> 17:43.580
Do you know about the Fermi Law?

17:43.580 --> 17:46.580
Do you know about the Fermi Law?

17:46.580 --> 17:49.580
Want to know about Fermi Law?

17:49.580 --> 17:52.580
Want to know about Fermi Law?

17:52.580 --> 17:55.580
Want to know about Fermi Law?

17:55.580 --> 17:58.580
want to know about Fermi Law?

18:29.580 --> 18:32.580
Questions

18:32.580 --> 18:35.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:35.580 --> 18:38.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:38.580 --> 18:41.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:41.580 --> 18:44.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:44.580 --> 18:47.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:47.580 --> 18:50.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:50.580 --> 18:53.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:53.580 --> 18:56.580
Because some galaxies are large

18:56.580 --> 18:59.580
It's curious, isn't this my job?

18:59.580 --> 19:02.580
Isn't this my job?

19:02.580 --> 19:05.580
Can you hear me?

19:05.580 --> 19:08.580
Let me ask

19:08.580 --> 19:11.580
Regarding the explanation

19:11.580 --> 19:14.580
Because there is dark matter

19:14.580 --> 19:17.580
It has weight but it can't be seen or observed

19:17.580 --> 19:19.580
It's just an explanation

19:19.580 --> 19:21.580
Is there any other explanation?

19:21.580 --> 19:24.580
Try to explain this matter

19:24.580 --> 19:27.580
And I'm very interested

19:27.580 --> 19:30.580
But first, it's hard to do experiments in a short time

19:30.580 --> 19:32.580
So I'm not doing it now

19:32.580 --> 19:34.580
But I've been thinking

19:34.580 --> 19:36.580
I told you that gravity is not wrong

19:36.580 --> 19:38.580
It's just that there are some matters you can't see

19:38.580 --> 19:41.580
The other best explanation is that gravity is wrong

19:41.580 --> 19:44.580
Is this okay?

19:44.580 --> 19:46.580
Yes, gravity is wrong

19:46.580 --> 19:48.580
The answer is this

19:48.580 --> 19:50.580
Why is gravity wrong is interesting

19:50.580 --> 19:52.580
Because we always know

19:52.580 --> 19:54.580
Quantum mechanics works very well

19:54.580 --> 19:57.580
It can explain almost everything we see

19:57.580 --> 19:59.580
Even if it can't explain

19:59.580 --> 20:01.580
It can also be based on quantum mechanics

20:01.580 --> 20:03.580
Give you a good model

20:03.580 --> 20:05.580
Except for one thing, we have no idea

20:05.580 --> 20:07.580
Is gravity

20:07.580 --> 20:09.580
We can't quantize it

20:09.580 --> 20:11.580
Then quantize can normalize

20:11.580 --> 20:13.580
It becomes a good theory

20:13.580 --> 20:15.580
So many people always think

20:15.580 --> 20:17.580
Another good explanation is dark matter

20:17.580 --> 20:19.580
Is a good example

20:20.580 --> 20:22.580
Some very important and we don't know

20:22.580 --> 20:24.580
In these places

20:24.580 --> 20:26.580
It will be with the traditional gravity we know

20:26.580 --> 20:28.580
Or quantum mechanics is incompatible

20:28.580 --> 20:30.580
Of course, there are many ways to explain

20:30.580 --> 20:32.580
We can talk about it later

20:32.580 --> 20:34.580
But basically this is my answer

20:34.580 --> 20:36.580
Gravity may be wrong

20:36.580 --> 20:38.580
This is also a direction

20:38.580 --> 20:40.580
Because I actually

20:40.580 --> 20:42.580
Stay in high school and university physics

20:42.580 --> 20:44.580
Let me feel like

20:44.580 --> 20:46.580
Maybe it sounds like etheric

20:47.580 --> 20:49.580
A little hypothetical

20:49.580 --> 20:51.580
This is just a model

20:51.580 --> 20:53.580
I agree

20:53.580 --> 20:55.580
Thank you

20:59.580 --> 21:01.580
Let's start talking about technical things

21:01.580 --> 21:03.580
First of all, what you see here

21:03.580 --> 21:05.580
Is what we know so far

21:05.580 --> 21:07.580
Dark matter

21:07.580 --> 21:09.580
Should say

21:09.580 --> 21:11.580
On the table

21:11.580 --> 21:13.580
Dark matter model

21:13.580 --> 21:15.580
You see the lightest

21:16.580 --> 21:18.580
That z is 10-

21:18.580 --> 21:20.580
369 12 15

21:20.580 --> 21:22.580
21 24

21:22.580 --> 21:24.580
Small z is 10-24

21:24.580 --> 21:26.580
Square EV

21:26.580 --> 21:28.580
This is the quality unit

21:28.580 --> 21:30.580
If you are not familiar with EV

21:30.580 --> 21:32.580
EV is the weight of the electron

21:32.580 --> 21:34.580
So it's so light

21:34.580 --> 21:36.580
10-24 square electron weight

21:36.580 --> 21:38.580
The heaviest

21:38.580 --> 21:40.580
Can be so heavy

21:40.580 --> 21:42.580
He can't use EV

21:42.580 --> 21:44.580
He is 30 solar weight on the right

21:45.580 --> 21:47.580
But we usually don't talk about

21:47.580 --> 21:49.580
PEV

21:49.580 --> 21:51.580
10-15 square electron weight

21:53.580 --> 21:55.580
Obviously we don't understand this problem

21:55.580 --> 21:57.580
Don't understand

21:57.580 --> 21:59.580
We can build up

21:59.580 --> 22:01.580
If you can imagine

22:01.580 --> 22:03.580
These things in the range

22:03.580 --> 22:05.580
May be a good model

22:05.580 --> 22:07.580
And not ruled out

22:07.580 --> 22:09.580
But the most important thing

22:09.580 --> 22:11.580
You can see that there are two groups

22:11.580 --> 22:13.580
A group on the right

22:13.580 --> 22:15.580
WIMP

22:15.580 --> 22:17.580
Hidden Sector Dark Matter

22:17.580 --> 22:19.580
Hidden Thermal Relic

22:19.580 --> 22:21.580
Asymmetric Dark Matter

22:21.580 --> 22:23.580
Freezing Dark Matter

22:23.580 --> 22:25.580
SIMP

22:25.580 --> 22:27.580
On the left

22:27.580 --> 22:29.580
Exia

22:29.580 --> 22:31.580
Ultralight

22:31.580 --> 22:33.580
What is the main difference

22:33.580 --> 22:35.580
The main difference is

22:35.580 --> 22:37.580
The heavier one

22:37.580 --> 22:39.580
It will calm down

22:39.580 --> 22:41.580
You can imagine

22:41.580 --> 22:43.580
In the process of cooling

22:43.580 --> 22:45.580
It will cool down

22:45.580 --> 22:47.580
Stop at a point

22:47.580 --> 22:49.580
Like a dot

22:49.580 --> 22:51.580
In our galaxy

22:51.580 --> 22:53.580
Like a planet

22:53.580 --> 22:55.580
Rotate like a dust

22:57.580 --> 22:59.580
Ultralight on the right

22:59.580 --> 23:01.580
Is the best name

23:01.580 --> 23:03.580
It's so light

23:03.580 --> 23:05.580
Its material wave is very long

23:05.580 --> 23:07.580
So long

23:07.580 --> 23:09.580
It may be as big as a galaxy

23:09.580 --> 23:11.580
So you can't define

23:11.580 --> 23:13.580
It is a point like

23:13.580 --> 23:15.580
Particle or wave

23:15.580 --> 23:17.580
Or matter wave

23:17.580 --> 23:19.580
So it has a very strong

23:19.580 --> 23:21.580
Coherence interaction

23:21.580 --> 23:23.580
Of course

23:23.580 --> 23:25.580
In other words, it will not cool down

23:25.580 --> 23:27.580
OK

23:27.580 --> 23:29.580
But the point we want to talk about today

23:29.580 --> 23:31.580
Is these particle-like

23:31.580 --> 23:33.580
Instead of wave-like

23:33.580 --> 23:35.580
So we will focus on today

23:35.580 --> 23:37.580
This orange part

23:37.580 --> 23:39.580
This orange part

23:39.580 --> 23:41.580
Is the so-called thermal relic

23:41.580 --> 23:43.580
For thermal relic

23:43.580 --> 23:45.580
Experts don't need me to explain

23:45.580 --> 23:47.580
According to my explanation

23:47.580 --> 23:49.580
In the process of cosmic cooling

23:49.580 --> 23:51.580
It will cool down

23:51.580 --> 23:53.580
Localize

23:53.580 --> 23:55.580
Point-like

23:55.580 --> 23:57.580
Then of course

23:57.580 --> 23:59.580
According to our observations on astronomy

23:59.580 --> 24:01.580
We can have some

24:01.580 --> 24:03.580
Restrictions

24:03.580 --> 24:05.580
These particles can't be less than

24:05.580 --> 24:07.580
Can't be more than

24:07.580 --> 24:09.580
Hundreds of T.E.V.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.580
This is the range

24:11.580 --> 24:13.580
OK

24:13.580 --> 24:15.580
The next page is

24:15.580 --> 24:17.580
How do we measure

24:17.580 --> 24:19.580
What you see here is a

24:19.580 --> 24:21.580
It's like a Feynman diagram

24:21.580 --> 24:23.580
It's not a Feynman diagram

24:23.580 --> 24:25.580
In other words, this chi or this big X

24:25.580 --> 24:27.580
Is the dark matter

24:27.580 --> 24:29.580
Dark matter

24:29.580 --> 24:31.580
Dark matter

24:31.580 --> 24:33.580
If they interact

24:33.580 --> 24:35.580
They can produce two

24:35.580 --> 24:37.580
Standard model

24:37.580 --> 24:39.580
We already know the particle

24:39.580 --> 24:41.580
Then they may shoot out

24:41.580 --> 24:43.580
For example, Neutrino, Gamma ray, X-ray

24:43.580 --> 24:45.580
Or Lepton

24:45.580 --> 24:47.580
Or even proton

24:47.580 --> 24:49.580
Then you can use some

24:49.580 --> 24:51.580
Measurement of cosmic radiation

24:51.580 --> 24:53.580
If something like this happens somewhere in the universe

24:53.580 --> 24:55.580
It may shoot out to the earth

24:55.580 --> 24:57.580
The particle we can measure

24:57.580 --> 24:59.580
For example, Anitta, IceCube, AMS, Fermi

24:59.580 --> 25:01.580
OK

25:01.580 --> 25:03.580
If you look at the top of this picture

25:03.580 --> 25:05.580
Collider is basically the opposite

25:05.580 --> 25:07.580
You take the Standard Model Particle

25:07.580 --> 25:09.580
With another Standard Model Particle

25:09.580 --> 25:11.580
Then put it together

25:11.580 --> 25:13.580
Then hope this one

25:13.580 --> 25:15.580
Matter energy will become

25:15.580 --> 25:17.580
What is that called

25:17.580 --> 25:19.580
Dark matter comes out

25:19.580 --> 25:21.580
Then I put a quotation here

25:21.580 --> 25:23.580
If both come out as dark matter, you're done

25:23.580 --> 25:25.580
You can't see anything

25:25.580 --> 25:27.580
But in Collider, if it comes out as dark matter

25:27.580 --> 25:29.580
The other one is not dark matter

25:29.580 --> 25:31.580
Then you have to go through another behavior

25:31.580 --> 25:33.580
To understand what that part is

25:33.580 --> 25:35.580
Then this is probably what Collider is doing

25:35.580 --> 25:37.580
What is LHC, Bell

25:37.580 --> 25:39.580
Or even there are many experiments

25:39.580 --> 25:41.580
It is Accelerator

25:41.580 --> 25:43.580
It may not be Collider

25:43.580 --> 25:45.580
It may be to take this beam and hit a target

25:45.580 --> 25:47.580
Then hope that target can shoot something

25:47.580 --> 25:49.580
That is also the concept

25:49.580 --> 25:51.580
OK, today our focus is

25:51.580 --> 25:53.580
Direct Detection

25:53.580 --> 25:55.580
Direct Detection is this picture

25:55.580 --> 25:57.580
Look up or look down

25:57.580 --> 25:59.580
What does this mean

25:59.580 --> 26:01.580
That is to say

26:01.580 --> 26:03.580
Standard Model Particle

26:03.580 --> 26:05.580
On the earth

26:05.580 --> 26:07.580
We use it as a detector

26:07.580 --> 26:09.580
Then there is a dark matter

26:09.580 --> 26:11.580
Hit it

26:11.580 --> 26:13.580
Then it bounced away

26:13.580 --> 26:15.580
Then this time it was hit

26:15.580 --> 26:17.580
Proton or Neutron or Electron

26:17.580 --> 26:19.580
We use it as a detector

26:19.580 --> 26:21.580
Will move, basically like this

26:21.580 --> 26:23.580
It moves like a baseball

26:23.580 --> 26:25.580
Then we measure this dynamic

26:25.580 --> 26:27.580
Its concept is basically like this

26:27.580 --> 26:29.580
The more famous one is

26:29.580 --> 26:31.580
Liquid Noble Gas

26:31.580 --> 26:33.580
Liquid Noble

26:33.580 --> 26:35.580
It is a doping element

26:35.580 --> 26:37.580
Turn it into a liquid

26:37.580 --> 26:39.580
Or you can use Solid State

26:39.580 --> 26:41.580
For example, semiconductor, superconductor, etc.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.580
Then there are some people who use Cavity

26:43.580 --> 26:45.580
But Cavity is usually not Thermal

26:45.580 --> 26:47.580
So I won't talk about it today

26:47.580 --> 26:49.580
Next page

26:49.580 --> 26:51.580
Then we will focus on

26:51.580 --> 26:53.580
So what is Direct Detection

26:53.580 --> 26:55.580
You can see the picture on the right

26:55.580 --> 26:57.580
Can I ask a question

26:57.580 --> 26:59.580
You say

26:59.580 --> 27:01.580
So

27:01.580 --> 27:03.580
From the beginning

27:03.580 --> 27:05.580
Everyone speculates that there is dark matter

27:05.580 --> 27:07.580
This matter

27:07.580 --> 27:09.580
It sounds like

27:09.580 --> 27:11.580
Assuming

27:11.580 --> 27:13.580
This gravity is right

27:13.580 --> 27:15.580
Then

27:15.580 --> 27:17.580
So I guess he must have

27:17.580 --> 27:19.580
Some dark matter that I can't observe

27:19.580 --> 27:21.580
So

27:21.580 --> 27:23.580
Is it possible

27:23.580 --> 27:25.580
Uh

27:25.580 --> 27:27.580
In the last page

27:27.580 --> 27:29.580
Those observations

27:29.580 --> 27:31.580
Direct or indirect observation

27:31.580 --> 27:33.580
The way of dark matter

27:33.580 --> 27:35.580
I must

27:35.580 --> 27:37.580
Is

27:37.580 --> 27:39.580
Every way

27:39.580 --> 27:41.580
Must rely on

27:41.580 --> 27:43.580
The relationship above

27:43.580 --> 27:45.580
To speculate the existence of dark matter

27:45.580 --> 27:47.580
Ok

27:47.580 --> 27:49.580
This is what I want to say first

27:49.580 --> 27:51.580
What we are doing

27:51.580 --> 27:53.580
Is hope

27:53.580 --> 27:55.580
Except for this

27:55.580 --> 27:57.580
We can really see

27:57.580 --> 27:59.580
It's like a particle

27:59.580 --> 28:01.580
Interaction

28:01.580 --> 28:03.580
Instead of

28:03.580 --> 28:05.580
Pure gravity

28:05.580 --> 28:07.580
But the answer is

28:07.580 --> 28:09.580
You are right

28:09.580 --> 28:11.580
So far all the phenomena we have seen are

28:11.580 --> 28:13.580
Only gravity

28:13.580 --> 28:15.580
No one else

28:15.580 --> 28:17.580
Why is it important

28:17.580 --> 28:19.580
Other interactions

28:19.580 --> 28:21.580
Understanding or restricting

28:21.580 --> 28:23.580
Uh this model is very important

28:23.580 --> 28:25.580
Important thing

28:25.580 --> 28:27.580
Then I just said something wrong

28:27.580 --> 28:29.580
That

28:29.580 --> 28:31.580
I made a very stupid mistake

28:31.580 --> 28:33.580
That is, the electronic quality is half MEV

28:33.580 --> 28:35.580
Not half EV

28:35.580 --> 28:37.580
Did I say EV?

28:37.580 --> 28:39.580
Anyway, the electronic quality is MEV

28:39.580 --> 28:41.580
Everyone will see

28:41.580 --> 28:43.580
This quality is important

28:43.580 --> 28:45.580
Ok, let's go back to the current projection

28:45.580 --> 28:47.580
I have a question

28:47.580 --> 28:49.580
I want to ask

28:49.580 --> 28:51.580
Does anyone predict

28:51.580 --> 28:53.580
How much is the distribution of dark matter

28:53.580 --> 28:55.580
How is it

28:55.580 --> 28:57.580
It is a

28:57.580 --> 28:59.580
Now is

28:59.580 --> 29:01.580
I can't imagine

29:01.580 --> 29:03.580
It is

29:03.580 --> 29:05.580
Dark matter is a

29:05.580 --> 29:07.580
Particle

29:07.580 --> 29:09.580
Such a thing exists

29:09.580 --> 29:11.580
Then every particle

29:11.580 --> 29:13.580
Has a certain quality

29:13.580 --> 29:15.580
Or say

29:15.580 --> 29:17.580
Any other way

29:17.580 --> 29:19.580
To judge this dark matter

29:19.580 --> 29:21.580
Is a group of things

29:21.580 --> 29:23.580
That group of things

29:23.580 --> 29:25.580
Various groups

29:25.580 --> 29:27.580
A group of groups

29:27.580 --> 29:29.580
Then each group does not necessarily have the same quality

29:29.580 --> 29:31.580
Like this

29:31.580 --> 29:33.580
Because now you look at your spectrum

29:33.580 --> 29:35.580
It looks like a lot less

29:35.580 --> 29:37.580
But it doesn't seem to say

29:37.580 --> 29:39.580
If I have any

29:39.580 --> 29:41.580
Prediction

29:41.580 --> 29:43.580
Then it will be

29:43.580 --> 29:45.580
A group of basic examples

29:45.580 --> 29:47.580
Or is it a

29:47.580 --> 29:49.580
Any group of quality

29:49.580 --> 29:51.580
Any energy

29:51.580 --> 29:53.580
Ok

29:53.580 --> 29:55.580
The answer is we don't know

29:55.580 --> 29:57.580
I can only tell you

29:57.580 --> 29:59.580
Now the general assumption is

29:59.580 --> 30:01.580
We measure the signal

30:01.580 --> 30:03.580
Then we

30:03.580 --> 30:05.580
Convert this signal to

30:05.580 --> 30:07.580
Interaction

30:07.580 --> 30:09.580
When these parameters

30:09.580 --> 30:11.580
You now see the upper right corner

30:11.580 --> 30:13.580
This picture

30:13.580 --> 30:15.580
Dark matter

30:15.580 --> 30:17.580
There is only one dark matter

30:17.580 --> 30:19.580
Then the quality of the particle

30:19.580 --> 30:21.580
That's the quality

30:21.580 --> 30:23.580
This is the assumption

30:23.580 --> 30:25.580
In many models

30:25.580 --> 30:27.580
Dark matter can have more than one

30:27.580 --> 30:29.580
Since there is more than one dark matter

30:29.580 --> 30:31.580
Its quality will not be only one

30:31.580 --> 30:33.580
So how it decays

30:33.580 --> 30:35.580
Or how it interacts

30:35.580 --> 30:37.580
Its scenario

30:37.580 --> 30:39.580
But in order to be able to compare each other

30:39.580 --> 30:41.580
Data

30:41.580 --> 30:43.580
On the same basis

30:43.580 --> 30:45.580
So now we usually assume

30:45.580 --> 30:47.580
Dark matter has only one

30:47.580 --> 30:49.580
Then we don't care what it is

30:49.580 --> 30:51.580
We only care about its quality

30:51.580 --> 30:53.580
Ok

30:53.580 --> 30:55.580
Got it

30:55.580 --> 30:57.580
Ok, let's go back to this page

30:57.580 --> 30:59.580
In fact, I just told you a lot about this page

30:59.580 --> 31:01.580
So how do we do it

31:01.580 --> 31:03.580
In this galaxy

31:03.580 --> 31:05.580
We built a detector on the earth

31:05.580 --> 31:07.580
Then our solar system

31:07.580 --> 31:09.580
Rotates inside

31:09.580 --> 31:11.580
So we keep bumping into this

31:11.580 --> 31:13.580
Our Milky Way

31:13.580 --> 31:15.580
Dark matter

31:15.580 --> 31:17.580
So it keeps changing

31:17.580 --> 31:19.580
In other words, we are on the earth

31:19.580 --> 31:21.580
With us as the coordinate

31:21.580 --> 31:23.580
Is it okay?

31:23.580 --> 31:25.580
This is our

31:25.580 --> 31:27.580
If you are from this

31:27.580 --> 31:29.580
Accelerator

31:29.580 --> 31:31.580
This is our

31:31.580 --> 31:33.580
Ok

31:33.580 --> 31:35.580
You can see that there are three pictures below

31:35.580 --> 31:37.580
Is dark matter

31:37.580 --> 31:39.580
Dark matter

31:39.580 --> 31:41.580
Sorry

31:41.580 --> 31:43.580
With our

31:43.580 --> 31:45.580
Normal matter

31:45.580 --> 31:47.580
Neutron, proton, electron

31:47.580 --> 31:49.580
Then run away like hitting a ball

31:49.580 --> 31:51.580
This is the first

31:51.580 --> 31:53.580
Its momentum transfer

31:53.580 --> 31:55.580
Energy transfer

31:55.580 --> 31:57.580
It's very simple

31:57.580 --> 31:59.580
You just need to know how heavy the two balls are

31:59.580 --> 32:01.580
Energy momentum conservation

32:01.580 --> 32:03.580
The second one is more interesting

32:03.580 --> 32:05.580
The second one is the picture in the middle

32:05.580 --> 32:07.580
How to do it

32:07.580 --> 32:09.580
If today

32:09.580 --> 32:11.580
If there is a

32:11.580 --> 32:13.580
Dark matter

32:13.580 --> 32:15.580
With normal

32:15.580 --> 32:17.580
We already know the matter

32:17.580 --> 32:19.580
They will exchange each other

32:19.580 --> 32:21.580
As long as they can

32:21.580 --> 32:23.580
As long as they can

32:23.580 --> 32:25.580
They have each other

32:25.580 --> 32:27.580
This quantum number

32:27.580 --> 32:29.580
Anyway, as long as they can

32:29.580 --> 32:31.580
Conserve some property

32:31.580 --> 32:33.580
They can walk around

32:33.580 --> 32:35.580
Become another

32:35.580 --> 32:37.580
What is hope

32:37.580 --> 32:39.580
It becomes

32:39.580 --> 32:41.580
Normal matter

32:41.580 --> 32:43.580
Then we can measure it

32:43.580 --> 32:45.580
The example you see below is

32:45.580 --> 32:47.580
If today there is a dark matter like boson

32:47.580 --> 32:49.580
Dark matter

32:49.580 --> 32:51.580
It may have a certain chance to convert

32:51.580 --> 32:53.580
The boson we know

32:53.580 --> 32:55.580
Here is an example

32:55.580 --> 32:57.580
Gamma

32:57.580 --> 32:59.580
Gamma is the same as the electron

32:59.580 --> 33:01.580
We can measure this

33:01.580 --> 33:03.580
Photon out of nowhere

33:03.580 --> 33:05.580
This is a dark matter signal

33:05.580 --> 33:07.580
The third one

33:07.580 --> 33:09.580
If dark matter

33:09.580 --> 33:11.580
Is this A

33:11.580 --> 33:13.580
If it comes in

33:13.580 --> 33:15.580
This dark matter

33:15.580 --> 33:17.580
It will decay itself

33:17.580 --> 33:19.580
Two light

33:19.580 --> 33:21.580
If your model

33:21.580 --> 33:23.580
Usually we will find

33:23.580 --> 33:25.580
You can have a process

33:25.580 --> 33:27.580
If you help it

33:27.580 --> 33:29.580
Supply another light

33:29.580 --> 33:31.580
You see this B

33:31.580 --> 33:33.580
It's usually a very strong magnetic field

33:33.580 --> 33:35.580
You are crazy

33:35.580 --> 33:37.580
Force it

33:37.580 --> 33:39.580
I give you a foot

33:39.580 --> 33:41.580
You go to another foot

33:41.580 --> 33:43.580
So you can supply it

33:43.580 --> 33:45.580
This magnetic field

33:45.580 --> 33:47.580
It came in and measured the light

33:47.580 --> 33:49.580
This is also a way

33:49.580 --> 33:51.580
If you have this

33:51.580 --> 33:53.580
You can do it

33:53.580 --> 33:55.580
We are not a single channel search

33:55.580 --> 33:57.580
We don't decide a channel

33:57.580 --> 33:59.580
How it will decay

34:01.580 --> 34:03.580
We put our detector

34:03.580 --> 34:05.580
Then dark matter

34:05.580 --> 34:07.580
We don't know what it is

34:07.580 --> 34:09.580
But we know it continues to hit our detector

34:09.580 --> 34:11.580
Then we see the signal

34:11.580 --> 34:13.580
We go again

34:13.580 --> 34:15.580
If it is this model

34:15.580 --> 34:17.580
What would it be

34:17.580 --> 34:19.580
So basically we are a bunch of models

34:19.580 --> 34:21.580
Then interpret

34:21.580 --> 34:23.580
What does it mean

34:27.580 --> 34:29.580
What you see now

34:29.580 --> 34:31.580
Is a very typical

34:31.580 --> 34:33.580
Experimental results

34:33.580 --> 34:35.580
That is to say

34:35.580 --> 34:37.580
If I assume today

34:37.580 --> 34:39.580
We want to look at dark matter

34:39.580 --> 34:41.580
Nucleic acid

34:41.580 --> 34:43.580
The contrast

34:43.580 --> 34:45.580
What you see

34:45.580 --> 34:47.580
Is the probability of action

34:47.580 --> 34:49.580
You see down

34:49.580 --> 34:51.580
The probability is getting smaller

34:51.580 --> 34:53.580
What about the horizontal

34:53.580 --> 34:55.580
Is this dark matter

34:55.580 --> 34:57.580
How do I read

34:57.580 --> 34:59.580
You assume a mass

34:59.580 --> 35:01.580
For example, ETEV

35:01.580 --> 35:03.580
Then you look up

35:03.580 --> 35:05.580
Then see a certain line

35:05.580 --> 35:07.580
Means

35:07.580 --> 35:09.580
A conclusion

35:09.580 --> 35:11.580
It's not right above this line

35:11.580 --> 35:13.580
Why

35:13.580 --> 35:15.580
Because if the quality of dark matter

35:15.580 --> 35:17.580
Is this ETEV

35:17.580 --> 35:19.580
Then the probability of action

35:19.580 --> 35:21.580
Will be greater than 10 to the negative 44

35:21.580 --> 35:23.580
Then I should have

35:23.580 --> 35:25.580
In the size of my detector

35:25.580 --> 35:27.580
And measuring time

35:27.580 --> 35:29.580
See a lot of signals

35:29.580 --> 35:31.580
But I didn't see anything

35:31.580 --> 35:33.580
So at the level of confidence

35:33.580 --> 35:35.580
I can say that it will never be greater than this value

35:35.580 --> 35:37.580
Then I can assume that dark matter is a lot of different qualities

35:37.580 --> 35:39.580
I can draw a line

35:39.580 --> 35:41.580
Is the line you see

35:41.580 --> 35:43.580
Is there a problem with this

35:43.580 --> 35:45.580
It's okay

35:45.580 --> 35:47.580
So basically

35:47.580 --> 35:49.580
There are many lines

35:49.580 --> 35:51.580
Each line is a different experiment

35:51.580 --> 35:53.580
But

35:53.580 --> 35:55.580
Every line

35:55.580 --> 35:57.580
The gray dotted line

35:57.580 --> 35:59.580
And then there is a grid

35:59.580 --> 36:01.580
What does that mean

36:01.580 --> 36:03.580
That's the sun

36:03.580 --> 36:05.580
The sun is not always acting on this

36:05.580 --> 36:07.580
This effect

36:07.580 --> 36:09.580
We can't avoid

36:09.580 --> 36:11.580
As long as we look at the sun

36:11.580 --> 36:13.580
This is the sun's

36:13.580 --> 36:15.580
Radiation

36:15.580 --> 36:17.580
That

36:17.580 --> 36:19.580
When your detector

36:19.580 --> 36:21.580
I want to ask a question

36:21.580 --> 36:23.580
That is to say, each line represents

36:23.580 --> 36:25.580
Every experiment

36:25.580 --> 36:27.580
It has a lot of models

36:27.580 --> 36:29.580
Every experiment

36:29.580 --> 36:31.580
It basically covers the model

36:31.580 --> 36:33.580
No, this is usually one experiment

36:33.580 --> 36:35.580
One model

36:35.580 --> 36:37.580
Usually the data from the same experiment

36:37.580 --> 36:39.580
Use different models to interpret

36:39.580 --> 36:41.580
OK

36:41.580 --> 36:43.580
Right

36:43.580 --> 36:45.580
Anyway

36:45.580 --> 36:47.580
Wait a minute

36:47.580 --> 36:49.580
I'll answer the question first

36:49.580 --> 36:51.580
What is the gray line

36:51.580 --> 36:53.580
That gray line is when your experiment

36:53.580 --> 36:55.580
When you get there

36:55.580 --> 36:57.580
You will start to see the sun

36:57.580 --> 36:59.580
Neutrino

36:59.580 --> 37:01.580
And under the gradient

37:01.580 --> 37:03.580
Under the gradient

37:03.580 --> 37:05.580
You can't tell the difference between dark matter and neutrino

37:05.580 --> 37:07.580
So you just

37:07.580 --> 37:09.580
Basically

37:09.580 --> 37:11.580
So that means

37:11.580 --> 37:13.580
In this picture

37:13.580 --> 37:15.580
When you put the rest

37:15.580 --> 37:17.580
No white space

37:17.580 --> 37:19.580
It means we

37:19.580 --> 37:21.580
It's not possible to use

37:21.580 --> 37:23.580
The method to detect

37:23.580 --> 37:25.580
Unless you can distinguish

37:25.580 --> 37:27.580
Neutrino and dark matter

37:27.580 --> 37:29.580
The difference in signal

37:29.580 --> 37:31.580
Otherwise you can't see it anymore

37:31.580 --> 37:33.580
Yeah

37:33.580 --> 37:35.580
OK

37:35.580 --> 37:37.580
Any other questions

37:37.580 --> 37:39.580
I have a question

37:39.580 --> 37:41.580
I just don't understand

37:41.580 --> 37:43.580
Is this line

37:43.580 --> 37:45.580
Why is there a

37:45.580 --> 37:47.580
Optimal

37:47.580 --> 37:49.580
The mass

37:49.580 --> 37:51.580
OK

37:51.580 --> 37:53.580
I'll talk about this

37:53.580 --> 37:55.580
Most of the lines are now

37:55.580 --> 37:57.580
For example

37:57.580 --> 37:59.580
Between 10-2 and 10-1

37:59.580 --> 38:01.580
There is a

38:01.580 --> 38:03.580
The deepest place

38:03.580 --> 38:05.580
Why is it so deep

38:05.580 --> 38:07.580
I'll talk about this later

38:07.580 --> 38:09.580
OK

38:09.580 --> 38:11.580
Sorry

38:11.580 --> 38:13.580
I want to ask this

38:13.580 --> 38:15.580
Is this a model-dependent

38:15.580 --> 38:17.580
Search

38:17.580 --> 38:19.580
Or is it a general search

38:19.580 --> 38:21.580
Is it a model-dependent

38:21.580 --> 38:23.580
Search or general search

38:23.580 --> 38:25.580
Uh

38:25.580 --> 38:27.580
In our field

38:27.580 --> 38:29.580
Usually this picture

38:29.580 --> 38:31.580
Model-independent

38:31.580 --> 38:33.580
Search

38:33.580 --> 38:35.580
Dark matter

38:35.580 --> 38:37.580
With your nucleon

38:37.580 --> 38:39.580
Elastic scattering

38:39.580 --> 38:41.580
But

38:41.580 --> 38:43.580
Literally

38:43.580 --> 38:45.580
You still have some models

38:45.580 --> 38:47.580
With nucleon

38:47.580 --> 38:49.580
Elastic scattering

38:49.580 --> 38:51.580
But

38:51.580 --> 38:53.580
But this

38:53.580 --> 38:55.580
So this picture is

38:55.580 --> 38:57.580
Elastic scattering

38:57.580 --> 38:59.580
And he has to assume one more thing

38:59.580 --> 39:01.580
Dark matter has nothing to do with spin

39:01.580 --> 39:03.580
If it has something to do with spin

39:03.580 --> 39:05.580
You have to reduce the number of neutrons and neutrons

39:05.580 --> 39:07.580
Because they will cancel

39:07.580 --> 39:09.580
So that's a model

39:09.580 --> 39:11.580
So to some extent this is not

39:11.580 --> 39:13.580
Model-independent in text

39:13.580 --> 39:15.580
But this thing is called model-independent

39:15.580 --> 39:17.580
Because it is the widest

39:17.580 --> 39:19.580
You can cover a lot of models

39:19.580 --> 39:21.580
OK

39:21.580 --> 39:23.580
Next page

39:23.580 --> 39:25.580
If you put this here

39:25.580 --> 39:27.580
This one is called limit plot

39:27.580 --> 39:29.580
This range, take a look at it

39:29.580 --> 39:31.580
What quality range

39:31.580 --> 39:33.580
Throw it back to the model I just saw

39:33.580 --> 39:35.580
You see it only digs that one

39:35.580 --> 39:37.580
Little piece is called classical

39:37.580 --> 39:39.580
WIMP

39:39.580 --> 39:41.580
If you are doing high-performance, you will know

39:41.580 --> 39:43.580
These things are all dug in

39:43.580 --> 39:45.580
Weak scale

39:45.580 --> 39:47.580
10 hundred times of weak scale

39:47.580 --> 39:49.580
What is it

39:49.580 --> 39:51.580
100

39:51.580 --> 39:53.580
100 GeV to a few GeV

39:53.580 --> 39:55.580
But this range

39:55.580 --> 39:57.580
It's very wide

39:57.580 --> 39:59.580
All these experiments are dug here

40:01.580 --> 40:03.580
Sorry

40:03.580 --> 40:05.580
What we want to do is ask a question

40:05.580 --> 40:07.580
What about the other parts

40:07.580 --> 40:09.580
What do we do

40:09.580 --> 40:11.580
OK

40:11.580 --> 40:13.580
So if you see this page now

40:13.580 --> 40:15.580
I reduced the whole picture

40:15.580 --> 40:17.580
Reduced to

40:17.580 --> 40:19.580
This picture you see

40:19.580 --> 40:21.580
Only the right side of this small piece

40:21.580 --> 40:23.580
The gray part is where they are now

40:23.580 --> 40:25.580
Digged

40:25.580 --> 40:27.580
Then

40:27.580 --> 40:29.580
The whole white one next to it

40:29.580 --> 40:31.580
I didn't dig it all

40:31.580 --> 40:33.580
Then I drew a lot on it

40:33.580 --> 40:35.580
Various models

40:35.580 --> 40:37.580
You can see it right away

40:37.580 --> 40:39.580
The experiment they are digging

40:39.580 --> 40:41.580
It's about 10 GeV to a few TeV

40:41.580 --> 40:43.580
Basically they are very

40:43.580 --> 40:45.580
Focus on this

40:45.580 --> 40:47.580
Supersymmetric theory

40:47.580 --> 40:49.580
MSSM

40:49.580 --> 40:51.580
MSSM

40:51.580 --> 40:53.580
Then according to different adjustments

40:53.580 --> 40:55.580
Its parameters

40:55.580 --> 40:57.580
It can slightly adjust its range

40:57.580 --> 40:59.580
But basically they are all digging

40:59.580 --> 41:01.580
These things

41:01.580 --> 41:03.580
But in fact, there are a lot of dark matter models

41:03.580 --> 41:05.580
You can see

41:05.580 --> 41:07.580
For example

41:07.580 --> 41:09.580
10 to 5 GeV

41:09.580 --> 41:11.580
There are still very good models here

41:11.580 --> 41:13.580
And it should

41:13.580 --> 41:15.580
So it should be Thermorelic

41:15.580 --> 41:17.580
What we want to ask is

41:17.580 --> 41:19.580
What about these models

41:19.580 --> 41:21.580
You can see it now

41:21.580 --> 41:23.580
I showed it

41:23.580 --> 41:25.580
That is

41:25.580 --> 41:27.580
What you see now

41:27.580 --> 41:29.580
I zoom in to these

41:29.580 --> 41:31.580
Places that have not been dug

41:31.580 --> 41:33.580
The actual line is already dug

41:33.580 --> 41:35.580
The actual line you can see

41:35.580 --> 41:37.580
It's all CDMS

41:37.580 --> 41:39.580
So I said CDMS is Low Mass Dark Matter Search

41:39.580 --> 41:41.580
Very important and

41:41.580 --> 41:43.580
It's basically a world-leading sensitivity

41:43.580 --> 41:45.580
Experiment

41:45.580 --> 41:47.580
If you see the long

41:47.580 --> 41:49.580
This virtual line

41:49.580 --> 41:51.580
Is already doing

41:51.580 --> 41:53.580
Then probably in a few years

41:53.580 --> 41:55.580
The result will come out

41:55.580 --> 41:57.580
Simulation expected results

41:57.580 --> 41:59.580
The best thing to see

41:59.580 --> 42:01.580
It should still be SNOLAB

42:01.580 --> 42:03.580
Except for this NewsG

42:03.580 --> 42:05.580
NewsG is quite above

42:05.580 --> 42:07.580
But its MassReach can reach

42:07.580 --> 42:09.580
Is 100 MeV

42:09.580 --> 42:11.580
Then if you see that dot line

42:11.580 --> 42:13.580
Dot line is that everyone has some concepts

42:13.580 --> 42:15.580
Then they use some

42:15.580 --> 42:17.580
Basic physical way

42:17.580 --> 42:19.580
To estimate the reach of these concepts

42:19.580 --> 42:21.580
So there are actually a lot of people

42:21.580 --> 42:23.580
Thinking about this

42:23.580 --> 42:25.580
But this thing is also

42:25.580 --> 42:27.580
WIMP Search

42:27.580 --> 42:29.580
Continuous

42:29.580 --> 42:31.580
LHC

42:31.580 --> 42:33.580
Effective machine

42:33.580 --> 42:35.580
This community

42:35.580 --> 42:37.580
This high-performance community is thinking

42:37.580 --> 42:39.580
If not WIMP

42:39.580 --> 42:41.580
Not SUSY

42:41.580 --> 42:43.580
How to do

42:43.580 --> 42:45.580
I will talk about

42:45.580 --> 42:47.580
How did these lines come

42:49.580 --> 42:51.580
I will be very fast

42:51.580 --> 42:53.580
Skip a big part

42:53.580 --> 42:55.580
Because I talked about it for a long time

42:55.580 --> 42:57.580
Recap

42:57.580 --> 42:59.580
So what is Elastic Scattering

42:59.580 --> 43:01.580
Basically what you see now

43:01.580 --> 43:03.580
Dark Matter comes in and hits your detector

43:03.580 --> 43:05.580
Then you can measure Recoil Energy

43:05.580 --> 43:07.580
Next is to answer

43:07.580 --> 43:09.580
The question just asked

43:09.580 --> 43:11.580
What is Elastic Scattering

43:11.580 --> 43:13.580
It is basically a momentum transfer

43:13.580 --> 43:15.580
You learned it when you were at PuWu

43:15.580 --> 43:17.580
How much energy has passed

43:17.580 --> 43:19.580
It's four times the energy

43:19.580 --> 43:21.580
Then multiply

43:21.580 --> 43:23.580
This two

43:23.580 --> 43:25.580
Hit and hit

43:25.580 --> 43:27.580
The quality of these two particles is not even

43:27.580 --> 43:29.580
If one is very heavy, one is very light

43:29.580 --> 43:31.580
Hit down

43:31.580 --> 43:33.580
The quality and energy will not pass

43:33.580 --> 43:35.580
When will it pass the most

43:35.580 --> 43:37.580
In these two hits and hits

43:37.580 --> 43:39.580
When their quality is the same

43:39.580 --> 43:41.580
100% will pass

43:41.580 --> 43:43.580
This also answers the question

43:43.580 --> 43:45.580
Why everyone digs

43:45.580 --> 43:47.580
Optimal point

43:47.580 --> 43:49.580
Because it is used to build

43:49.580 --> 43:51.580
The particle of the detector

43:51.580 --> 43:53.580
It's almost in that position

43:53.580 --> 43:55.580
It's so heavy

43:55.580 --> 43:57.580
It is the most sensitive

43:57.580 --> 43:59.580
Is this okay

43:59.580 --> 44:01.580
Everyone can see

44:01.580 --> 44:03.580
If my model today

44:03.580 --> 44:05.580
My particle is probably GEV

44:05.580 --> 44:07.580
Nucleon

44:07.580 --> 44:09.580
These boxes are probably GEV

44:09.580 --> 44:11.580
More than 900

44:11.580 --> 44:13.580
About 1000

44:13.580 --> 44:15.580
In the position of the earth

44:15.580 --> 44:17.580
Gravity

44:17.580 --> 44:19.580
The speed of rotation of all particles

44:19.580 --> 44:21.580
About 300 km per second

44:21.580 --> 44:23.580
Put the number in

44:23.580 --> 44:25.580
You will see the energy

44:25.580 --> 44:27.580
Probably

44:27.580 --> 44:29.580
An X-ray energy

44:29.580 --> 44:31.580
Just a few tens of keV

44:31.580 --> 44:33.580
But if

44:33.580 --> 44:35.580
Today you put your

44:35.580 --> 44:37.580
Model from this box

44:37.580 --> 44:39.580
Change to electronic

44:39.580 --> 44:41.580
It's very, very light

44:41.580 --> 44:43.580
At this time

44:43.580 --> 44:45.580
You get the maximum

44:45.580 --> 44:47.580
Momentum transfer

44:47.580 --> 44:49.580
Will come from

44:49.580 --> 44:51.580
A very light particle

44:51.580 --> 44:53.580
Let's imagine today

44:53.580 --> 44:55.580
The quality of the electronic is probably MEV scale

44:55.580 --> 44:57.580
Half MEV scale

44:57.580 --> 44:59.580
If you hit your particle at this time

44:59.580 --> 45:01.580
It's also half MEV or MEV

45:01.580 --> 45:03.580
At this time you put the number in

45:03.580 --> 45:05.580
Your maximum energy detection

45:05.580 --> 45:07.580
It can be from about 0.1 to

45:07.580 --> 45:09.580
100 EV so much energy

45:09.580 --> 45:11.580
It's probably less than sub keV

45:13.580 --> 45:15.580
Then even

45:15.580 --> 45:17.580
You have the mismatch of the mass

45:17.580 --> 45:19.580
The dark matter you came in is

45:19.580 --> 45:21.580
100 MEV

45:21.580 --> 45:23.580
Sorry

45:25.580 --> 45:27.580
Compare this energy

45:27.580 --> 45:29.580
If you today

45:29.580 --> 45:31.580
There is a 100 MEV

45:31.580 --> 45:33.580
Mass

45:33.580 --> 45:35.580
The dark matter hit your nuclear

45:35.580 --> 45:37.580
It's GEV

45:37.580 --> 45:39.580
You can probably see

45:39.580 --> 45:41.580
Sub to 1 keV

45:41.580 --> 45:43.580
This kind of energy

45:43.580 --> 45:45.580
So if we can use

45:45.580 --> 45:47.580
This method and then measure such a small energy

45:47.580 --> 45:49.580
We can start to measure very light particles

45:51.580 --> 45:53.580
But if we go back to that page

45:53.580 --> 45:55.580
If you have a dark matter as heavy as electronic

45:55.580 --> 45:57.580
To hit your nuclear

45:57.580 --> 45:59.580
It will leave us one thousandth of the energy

45:59.580 --> 46:01.580
It's basically very difficult to measure

46:03.580 --> 46:05.580
What do you mean by Coherent?

46:05.580 --> 46:07.580
What do you mean by Coherent?

46:09.580 --> 46:11.580
First of all, I want to explain what Coherent is

46:11.580 --> 46:13.580
Coherent is

46:13.580 --> 46:15.580
If you have dark matter today

46:15.580 --> 46:17.580
The size of its wave packet

46:17.580 --> 46:19.580
Probably

46:19.580 --> 46:21.580
It's not the size of a nuclear

46:21.580 --> 46:23.580
But the size of your entire atomic nucleus

46:23.580 --> 46:25.580
The energy it hits

46:25.580 --> 46:27.580
Coherent is smaller than

46:27.580 --> 46:29.580
Nuclear binding energy scale

46:29.580 --> 46:31.580
It's more like hitting the entire atomic nucleus

46:33.580 --> 46:35.580
It's a hit on the entire atomic nucleus

46:35.580 --> 46:37.580
All the nuclei

46:37.580 --> 46:39.580
So the rate of this hit

46:39.580 --> 46:41.580
You pick up this signal

46:41.580 --> 46:43.580
The chance is with

46:43.580 --> 46:45.580
How many atomic nuclei

46:45.580 --> 46:47.580
The nucleus becomes positive

46:47.580 --> 46:49.580
The wave amplitude becomes positive

46:49.580 --> 46:51.580
So the probability is positive square

46:51.580 --> 46:53.580
So the hit event rate

46:53.580 --> 46:55.580
How many atomic nuclei

46:55.580 --> 46:57.580
How many nuclei become positive square

46:57.580 --> 46:59.580
But if it's electronic today

46:59.580 --> 47:01.580
Because

47:01.580 --> 47:03.580
Unless you can have an electronic

47:03.580 --> 47:05.580
Bound state

47:05.580 --> 47:07.580
Otherwise free electron

47:07.580 --> 47:09.580
Or bound to

47:09.580 --> 47:11.580
These electrons are far away

47:11.580 --> 47:13.580
So you basically only hit one at a time

47:13.580 --> 47:15.580
So there is no Coherent

47:15.580 --> 47:17.580
Addition effect

47:19.580 --> 47:21.580
OK?

47:21.580 --> 47:23.580
Continue

47:23.580 --> 47:25.580
As I said

47:25.580 --> 47:27.580
If dark matter becomes photon

47:27.580 --> 47:29.580
It will be absorbed by charged particles

47:29.580 --> 47:31.580
So how much energy it absorbs

47:31.580 --> 47:33.580
How much total energy

47:35.580 --> 47:37.580
So recap

47:37.580 --> 47:39.580
Low mass search

47:39.580 --> 47:41.580
Basically called a few GeV

47:41.580 --> 47:43.580
Or lighter

47:43.580 --> 47:45.580
Basically you want to see very little energy

47:45.580 --> 47:47.580
So you want your

47:47.580 --> 47:49.580
Detector

47:49.580 --> 47:51.580
Energy threshold

47:51.580 --> 47:53.580
Very low

47:53.580 --> 47:55.580
You can start to see very little energy

47:55.580 --> 47:57.580
If you just go back to the picture

47:57.580 --> 47:59.580
It has a deepest place

47:59.580 --> 48:01.580
That place is usually marked

48:01.580 --> 48:03.580
Its maximum energy transfer

48:03.580 --> 48:05.580
But

48:05.580 --> 48:07.580
Towards a smaller energy or lighter mass

48:07.580 --> 48:09.580
Sensitivity

48:09.580 --> 48:11.580
Suddenly shot very high and then there is no line

48:11.580 --> 48:13.580
Because their energy threshold

48:13.580 --> 48:15.580
Detector's trigger threshold is there

48:15.580 --> 48:17.580
They can't shoot any smaller

48:17.580 --> 48:19.580
So there is a very important idea

48:19.580 --> 48:21.580
You have to have a very low

48:21.580 --> 48:23.580
Threshold to measure very light particles

48:23.580 --> 48:25.580
OK

48:25.580 --> 48:27.580
Of course I just told you

48:27.580 --> 48:29.580
There are a lot of new models

48:29.580 --> 48:31.580
Dark sector, Asymmetric DM, Freezing DM

48:31.580 --> 48:33.580
Blah blah blah

48:33.580 --> 48:35.580
But how do we do this

48:35.580 --> 48:37.580
Detector

48:37.580 --> 48:39.580
Let me recap

48:39.580 --> 48:41.580
We want to maximize

48:41.580 --> 48:43.580
Momentum transfer

48:43.580 --> 48:45.580
So if you want to measure light particles

48:45.580 --> 48:47.580
The picture here

48:47.580 --> 48:49.580
Asymmetric

48:49.580 --> 48:51.580
Dark matter

48:51.580 --> 48:53.580
Sorry

48:53.580 --> 48:55.580
Blah blah blah

48:55.580 --> 48:57.580
Dark matter mass

48:57.580 --> 48:59.580
Asymmetric

48:59.580 --> 49:01.580
Energy transfer, Momentum transfer

49:01.580 --> 49:03.580
You see all kinds of different elements

49:03.580 --> 49:05.580
Its peak

49:05.580 --> 49:07.580
Different places

49:07.580 --> 49:09.580
The lighter the element, the peak

49:09.580 --> 49:11.580
You can probe lighter mass

49:11.580 --> 49:13.580
Does this make sense

49:13.580 --> 49:15.580
Electron recoil

49:15.580 --> 49:17.580
It's the lightest

49:17.580 --> 49:19.580
OK

49:19.580 --> 49:21.580
Of course, in addition to this

49:21.580 --> 49:23.580
You have to maximize energy transfer

49:23.580 --> 49:25.580
You have to have very low noise

49:25.580 --> 49:27.580
You have to have a very high signal-to-noise ratio

49:27.580 --> 49:29.580
To be able to measure such a small energy

49:29.580 --> 49:31.580
So you have to have sub-KEV sensitivity

49:31.580 --> 49:33.580
Then if you want

49:33.580 --> 49:35.580
Can measure

49:35.580 --> 49:37.580
You have to have very, very good ability to

49:37.580 --> 49:39.580
Shoot limit or you have to be able to see

49:39.580 --> 49:41.580
Interaction probability

49:41.580 --> 49:43.580
Or cross-section is very small

49:43.580 --> 49:45.580
Then your

49:45.580 --> 49:47.580
Fake event background event rate

49:47.580 --> 49:49.580
Very, very low

49:49.580 --> 49:51.580
OK, here I will quickly

49:51.580 --> 49:53.580
Skip because I actually want to talk about the third part

49:53.580 --> 49:55.580
Super CDMS

49:55.580 --> 49:57.580
So what are we doing now

49:57.580 --> 49:59.580
Sorry

49:59.580 --> 50:01.580
I'll go back to that side

50:01.580 --> 50:03.580
Is there a problem

50:05.580 --> 50:07.580
No problem

50:07.580 --> 50:09.580
Can you hear me

50:09.580 --> 50:11.580
You said

50:11.580 --> 50:13.580
In fact, my physics is probably only high school physics

50:13.580 --> 50:15.580
But it sounds like

50:15.580 --> 50:17.580
You assume

50:17.580 --> 50:19.580
Dark matter particles

50:19.580 --> 50:21.580
With normal matter particles

50:21.580 --> 50:23.580
There are all kinds of different models

50:23.580 --> 50:25.580
Then energy will be generated

50:25.580 --> 50:27.580
So you measure this energy

50:27.580 --> 50:29.580
Then learn that this

50:29.580 --> 50:31.580
Dark matter

50:31.580 --> 50:33.580
How much is the mass

50:33.580 --> 50:35.580
Is that right

50:35.580 --> 50:37.580
In this case

50:37.580 --> 50:39.580
Suppose you do the experiment today

50:39.580 --> 50:41.580
Then measured the energy

50:41.580 --> 50:43.580
But this does not mean

50:43.580 --> 50:45.580
That your assumption model is correct

50:49.580 --> 50:51.580
Yes, you are right

50:51.580 --> 50:53.580
So this situation

50:53.580 --> 50:55.580
But this situation

50:55.580 --> 50:57.580
Should still be able to get at least

50:57.580 --> 50:59.580
Conclusion that dark matter does exist

50:59.580 --> 51:01.580
So this experiment

51:01.580 --> 51:03.580
The point is

51:03.580 --> 51:05.580
Is to prove the existence of dark matter

51:05.580 --> 51:07.580
Is this

51:07.580 --> 51:09.580
I

51:09.580 --> 51:11.580
The first is to prove the existence of dark matter

51:11.580 --> 51:13.580
This is the most important

51:13.580 --> 51:15.580
The second is basically

51:15.580 --> 51:17.580
Under the same logic

51:17.580 --> 51:19.580
What we are doing now

51:19.580 --> 51:21.580
Basically no one sees dark matter

51:21.580 --> 51:23.580
So we can keep

51:23.580 --> 51:25.580
Some models propose

51:25.580 --> 51:27.580
You should see dark matter here

51:27.580 --> 51:29.580
You should see this sensitivity

51:29.580 --> 51:31.580
You can't see it, we can remove them all

51:31.580 --> 51:33.580
So we are actually

51:33.580 --> 51:35.580
Narrow down the possible parameter space

51:37.580 --> 51:39.580
Oh

51:39.580 --> 51:41.580
Now the logic is basically like this

51:41.580 --> 51:43.580
But you are absolutely right

51:43.580 --> 51:45.580
If one day everyone starts

51:45.580 --> 51:47.580
A certain cross-section

51:47.580 --> 51:49.580
Then in a certain mass

51:49.580 --> 51:51.580
Start to see the event

51:51.580 --> 51:53.580
When dark matter is here

51:53.580 --> 51:55.580
Think about it

51:55.580 --> 51:57.580
How to measure these signals

51:57.580 --> 51:59.580
To understand what it is

51:59.580 --> 52:01.580
Ok

52:01.580 --> 52:03.580
Thank you

52:03.580 --> 52:05.580
What are we doing now

52:05.580 --> 52:07.580
We are doing a time called cryogenic dark matter search

52:07.580 --> 52:09.580
Cryogenic means super low temperature

52:09.580 --> 52:11.580
What we are doing is like this

52:11.580 --> 52:13.580
What you see now is this right side

52:13.580 --> 52:15.580
It's a super thin or fold

52:15.580 --> 52:17.580
Group of germanium

52:17.580 --> 52:19.580
Its size

52:19.580 --> 52:21.580
It's about 10 centimeters

52:21.580 --> 52:23.580
Its thickness is 3.3 centimeters

52:23.580 --> 52:25.580
Not kilometers, it's centimeters

52:25.580 --> 52:27.580
So this is one you've never seen

52:27.580 --> 52:29.580
Super big piece of germanium

52:29.580 --> 52:31.580
Or silicon

52:31.580 --> 52:33.580
You go out and buy wafer

52:33.580 --> 52:35.580
It will never help you cut such a thick piece

52:35.580 --> 52:37.580
But our detector looks like this

52:37.580 --> 52:39.580
If you look at the left

52:39.580 --> 52:41.580
This white line is dark matter

52:41.580 --> 52:43.580
Knock on the atomic box and run out

52:43.580 --> 52:45.580
Then see this blue one

52:45.580 --> 52:47.580
It will dissipate heat

52:47.580 --> 52:49.580
Then this heat dissipation

52:49.580 --> 52:51.580
Because it is very, very low energy

52:51.580 --> 52:53.580
It is very localized

52:53.580 --> 52:55.580
Then at the same time

52:55.580 --> 52:57.580
The electrons in your material

52:57.580 --> 52:59.580
And this electric team

52:59.580 --> 53:01.580
So it will shoot this red

53:01.580 --> 53:03.580
Ok, this is the electronic electric team

53:03.580 --> 53:05.580
So what are we measuring

53:05.580 --> 53:07.580
We are measuring these electronic electric teams

53:07.580 --> 53:09.580
At the same time we are also measuring phonon

53:09.580 --> 53:11.580
We measured this phonon

53:11.580 --> 53:13.580
And this electric team

53:13.580 --> 53:15.580
We can see very, very small signals

53:15.580 --> 53:17.580
Ok, the next page is talking about

53:19.580 --> 53:21.580
Why do we have to measure at the same time

53:21.580 --> 53:23.580
Electronic electric team

53:23.580 --> 53:25.580
To measure phonon

53:25.580 --> 53:27.580
If today

53:27.580 --> 53:29.580
Particle is hit

53:29.580 --> 53:31.580
That atomic box

53:31.580 --> 53:33.580
It will be about 1 in 3

53:33.580 --> 53:35.580
Its phonon energy

53:35.580 --> 53:37.580
With ionization

53:37.580 --> 53:39.580
Is the electric team

53:39.580 --> 53:41.580
Energy ratio is about 1 to 3

53:41.580 --> 53:43.580
Phonon is about 3 times

53:43.580 --> 53:45.580
But if it hits today

53:45.580 --> 53:47.580
Is that electron

53:47.580 --> 53:49.580
100% electron

53:49.580 --> 53:51.580
Its ionization energy

53:51.580 --> 53:53.580
Is 100%

53:53.580 --> 53:55.580
So there is a difference of 1 to 3

53:55.580 --> 53:57.580
So if you see this picture next to it today

53:57.580 --> 53:59.580
There will be a very obvious difference

53:59.580 --> 54:01.580
So we can immediately identify

54:01.580 --> 54:03.580
It is hit

54:03.580 --> 54:05.580
Why is this important

54:07.580 --> 54:09.580
Because if today

54:09.580 --> 54:11.580
Is very heavy

54:11.580 --> 54:13.580
It will not leave energy

54:13.580 --> 54:15.580
It will leave energy

54:15.580 --> 54:17.580
So you want to vary

54:17.580 --> 54:19.580
This is a lot of energy

54:19.580 --> 54:21.580
To hit the atomic box

54:21.580 --> 54:23.580
Or we know

54:23.580 --> 54:25.580
To hit the electron

54:25.580 --> 54:27.580
So we have this ability

54:29.580 --> 54:31.580
I want to skip this

54:31.580 --> 54:33.580
So we are based on this ability

54:33.580 --> 54:35.580
We made a detector

54:35.580 --> 54:37.580
You see this big piece of crystal

54:37.580 --> 54:39.580
There are a lot of small things on the surface

54:39.580 --> 54:41.580
It is a super conductor

54:41.580 --> 54:43.580
When it picks up energy

54:43.580 --> 54:45.580
It will immediately from the superconductor

54:45.580 --> 54:47.580
Turn into a normal conductor

54:47.580 --> 54:49.580
In this fast

54:49.580 --> 54:51.580
In the process of transformation

54:51.580 --> 54:53.580
Its sensitivity is very large

54:53.580 --> 54:55.580
A little bit of energy

54:55.580 --> 54:57.580
Its electron will change a lot

54:57.580 --> 54:59.580
So we can use this thing to do very, very precise measurements

54:59.580 --> 55:01.580
At the same time, we also designed a very good

55:01.580 --> 55:03.580
This

55:03.580 --> 55:05.580
The distribution of electrons

55:05.580 --> 55:07.580
In the lower right corner of this picture

55:07.580 --> 55:09.580
If it is on the surface

55:09.580 --> 55:11.580
Hit

55:11.580 --> 55:13.580
Electrons and electrons will run to the same side

55:13.580 --> 55:15.580
If you hit it in the middle

55:15.580 --> 55:17.580
Electrons and electrons will be pulled to one side

55:19.580 --> 55:21.580
Why is this important

55:21.580 --> 55:23.580
Because most of the particles we already know

55:23.580 --> 55:25.580
Relative to dark matter

55:25.580 --> 55:27.580
It's easier to be blocked on the surface than in the middle

55:27.580 --> 55:29.580
Because dark matter is the hardest to block

55:29.580 --> 55:31.580
It will go to the middle

55:31.580 --> 55:33.580
So the more to the middle, the more like dark matter

55:33.580 --> 55:35.580
So we can do this

55:35.580 --> 55:37.580
I don't want to talk about this at all

55:37.580 --> 55:39.580
I just want to conclude

55:39.580 --> 55:41.580
About this kind

55:41.580 --> 55:43.580
Hit the nucleus or hit the electron

55:43.580 --> 55:45.580
This kind of detector

55:45.580 --> 55:47.580
In our expected detection time

55:47.580 --> 55:49.580
We have 100% confidence

55:49.580 --> 55:51.580
We can distinguish

55:51.580 --> 55:53.580
Nuclear recoil or

55:53.580 --> 55:55.580
Electron recoil

55:55.580 --> 55:57.580
We can do a good job

55:57.580 --> 55:59.580
Find dark matter

55:59.580 --> 56:01.580
This kind of style

56:01.580 --> 56:03.580
Dark matter search

56:03.580 --> 56:05.580
In addition to this

56:05.580 --> 56:07.580
We have another thing to use

56:07.580 --> 56:09.580
This thing is called

56:09.580 --> 56:11.580
HV detector

56:11.580 --> 56:13.580
HV means high voltage

56:13.580 --> 56:15.580
We are on this

56:15.580 --> 56:17.580
Detector

56:17.580 --> 56:19.580
Add a very large

56:19.580 --> 56:21.580
This power plant

56:21.580 --> 56:23.580
If it is released

56:23.580 --> 56:25.580
Any free electronic electric team

56:25.580 --> 56:27.580
It will be very fast

56:27.580 --> 56:29.580
Speed ​​up

56:29.580 --> 56:31.580
It's in this crystal

56:31.580 --> 56:33.580
Middle speed

56:33.580 --> 56:35.580
But the reason is that it can't exceed

56:35.580 --> 56:37.580
So as long as it exceeds the middle speed

56:37.580 --> 56:39.580
It is called heat dissipation

56:39.580 --> 56:41.580
The meaning of heat dissipation

56:41.580 --> 56:43.580
Is to create additional

56:43.580 --> 56:45.580
Secondary phonon emission

56:45.580 --> 56:47.580
So you add a big power plant to it

56:47.580 --> 56:49.580
As long as you

56:49.580 --> 56:51.580
Activate a free

56:51.580 --> 56:53.580
Electronic electric team

56:53.580 --> 56:55.580
You will get a lot of phonon energy

56:55.580 --> 56:57.580
So

56:57.580 --> 56:59.580
We can put very small

56:59.580 --> 57:01.580
Enlarge to very large

57:01.580 --> 57:03.580
So at this time

57:03.580 --> 57:05.580
If your

57:05.580 --> 57:07.580
Threshold is from your electronic

57:07.580 --> 57:09.580
Noise

57:09.580 --> 57:11.580
Our signal will be far greater than the noise

57:11.580 --> 57:13.580
So we

57:13.580 --> 57:15.580
Equivalent trigger

57:15.580 --> 57:17.580
Trigger on specific recoil energy

57:17.580 --> 57:19.580
Our threshold will be very, very low

57:19.580 --> 57:21.580
We can lower the threshold by 100 times

57:21.580 --> 57:23.580
If you give it 100 volts

57:23.580 --> 57:25.580
This drift

57:25.580 --> 57:27.580
The voltage

57:27.580 --> 57:29.580
But what is his problem

57:29.580 --> 57:31.580
Basically you are now

57:31.580 --> 57:33.580
Electron recoil or nuclear recoil

57:33.580 --> 57:35.580
You have completely lost the distortion

57:35.580 --> 57:37.580
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil

57:37.580 --> 57:39.580
But we can see very small energy

57:39.580 --> 57:41.580
I don't want to talk about this

57:41.580 --> 57:43.580
Basically just want to say

57:43.580 --> 57:45.580
We have to build a big experiment

57:45.580 --> 57:47.580
And then get it to very, very low temperature

57:47.580 --> 57:49.580
Otherwise thermal agitation

57:49.580 --> 57:51.580
Will keep creating thermal phonon

57:51.580 --> 57:53.580
Ok

57:53.580 --> 57:55.580
I jumped directly to the last page

57:55.580 --> 57:57.580
Now everyone sees

57:57.580 --> 57:59.580
There is a lot of radioactivity

57:59.580 --> 58:01.580
What kind of money

58:01.580 --> 58:03.580
What is this

58:03.580 --> 58:05.580
Uranium

58:05.580 --> 58:07.580
These things are all in our experimental environment

58:07.580 --> 58:09.580
Then they will be radioactive

58:09.580 --> 58:11.580
Is to shoot all kinds of particles

58:11.580 --> 58:13.580
We want to make sure

58:13.580 --> 58:15.580
All these elements are very, very

58:15.580 --> 58:17.580
In our experiment

58:17.580 --> 58:19.580
We can see

58:19.580 --> 58:21.580
Just make sure that if there is really a signal today

58:21.580 --> 58:23.580
I saw we have a lot of confidence

58:23.580 --> 58:25.580
It will never be these impurities

58:25.580 --> 58:27.580
Radioactivity

58:27.580 --> 58:29.580
I don't want to skip this

58:29.580 --> 58:31.580
This is basically to say

58:31.580 --> 58:33.580
So we put all these

58:33.580 --> 58:35.580
Background radioactivity

58:35.580 --> 58:37.580
Then there is just said

58:37.580 --> 58:39.580
IZ and HV detector

58:39.580 --> 58:41.580
Germanium and silicon

58:41.580 --> 58:43.580
Then put it on

58:43.580 --> 58:45.580
You will see that in the end we can

58:45.580 --> 58:47.580
Dig this piece

58:47.580 --> 58:49.580
We haven't yet

58:49.580 --> 58:51.580
This 2020 will start

58:51.580 --> 58:53.580
It is expected to run for five years

58:53.580 --> 58:55.580
You can dig this piece

58:55.580 --> 58:57.580
Here is very sloppy

58:57.580 --> 58:59.580
Is there a problem

59:01.580 --> 59:03.580
Is this pink

59:03.580 --> 59:05.580
This orange pink piece

59:15.580 --> 59:17.580
Hey you say that again

59:17.580 --> 59:19.580
Did you just detect all the detect functions?

59:19.580 --> 59:21.580
Can you explain this place again?

59:21.580 --> 59:23.580
Can you explain this place again?

59:23.580 --> 59:25.580
Forget it

59:25.580 --> 59:27.580
Let's talk about it at the end

59:27.580 --> 59:29.580
It feels like it will be a long time

59:29.580 --> 59:31.580
Actually, it's okay

59:31.580 --> 59:33.580
This thing is what you think

59:33.580 --> 59:35.580
Is

59:35.580 --> 59:37.580
If you are today

59:37.580 --> 59:39.580
I just didn't say if your dark matter

59:39.580 --> 59:41.580
Hit the atomic box

59:41.580 --> 59:43.580
There will be one-third of the ionization

59:43.580 --> 59:45.580
One-third of the energy

59:45.580 --> 59:47.580
Will also become a double pair

59:47.580 --> 59:49.580
But if today your dark matter

59:49.580 --> 59:51.580
It's 100%

59:51.580 --> 59:53.580
If it's enough

59:53.580 --> 59:55.580
Then these two scenarios

59:55.580 --> 59:57.580
Will produce an electron and a double pair

59:57.580 --> 59:59.580
That produces an electron and a double pair

59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.580
Then I give it a high pressure

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.580
This high pressure will pull this electron

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.580
Accelerate to very fast

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.580
Accelerate to exceed its terminal speed

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.580
But when it exceeds the terminal speed

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.580
It must decelerate

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.580
Its principle is basically like this

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.580
It decelerates

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.580
It has to release energy

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.580
So basically

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.580
I don't care if I want to look at nuclear recoil

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.580
Or electron recoil

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.580
I'm starting to look at phonon now

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.580
What about the phonon I see

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.580
If today is nuclear recoil

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:31.580
It primary

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.580
There will be phonon

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.580
Then the ionization it creates at the same time

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.580
Pulled like this

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.580
There will also be secondary phonon

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.580
I look at nuclear recoil, I look at these two phonons

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.580
Phonon signal

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.580
But if today is electron recoil

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.580
I basically look at these electrons

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.580
After all were ionized

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.580
How many secondary phonons did they create

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.580
Probably like this

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.580
Is it clear to me?

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580
Ok, keep going, thank you

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.580
Ok

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580
This page

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.580
I want to skip

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.580
Ok, I'll just talk about this page

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.580
I'm starting to talk now

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.580
Sorry, I'm starting to talk now

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.580
So how do all these things integrate into the future

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.580
That is to say

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.580
We found one thing

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.580
I've been talking about it all the time

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.580
Today

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.580
If there is nuclear recoil

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.580
About one-third of the energy

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.580
You can still see one-third of the energy in ionization

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.580
Compared to your phonon energy

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.580
This thing

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.580
Probably right

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.580
Our best model now is called Linhardt

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.580
This is actually a half century old model

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.580
He explains

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.580
That is

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.580
The effect of electronic shielding on the atomic

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.580
Then you can see

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.580
One-third of this

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.580
I just talked about one-third of it

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.580
There is a blue line

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.580
This is the model

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.580
If you hit the energy

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.580
What is above 10 keV

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.580
It's all right

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.580
But below 10 keV

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.580
It's getting worse

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.580
But no one knows

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.580
Because no one could measure such a small energy

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.580
But now everyone can measure such a small energy

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.580
You have to measure very small energy

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.580
You can start detecting very small

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.580
Very light dark matter

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.580
So this thing becomes very important

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.580
So this is a very important direction

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.580
We are going to start studying

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.580
What is this ratio

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.580
This thing is very

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.580
Go hand in hand with low-threshold detector

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.580
Because you can't

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.580
You have to be able to measure such a small energy

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.580
Then you can start constraining this ratio

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.580
This ratio is currently

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.580
If you want to measure nuclear recoil

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.580
This is the highest level of certainty in your analysis

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.580
Then skip this page

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.580
The second one is

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.580
We can put this kind of high-voltage

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.580
How good is this kind of high-voltage detector

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.580
How good is this kind of high-voltage detector

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.580
What about a recent paper

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.580
Stanford has a group

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.580
They made this little chip

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.580
This little chip is about 1 cm x 1 cm

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.580
This is 1 cm x 1 cm

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.580
Just as big as a thumb

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.580
Then its thickness is 1 cm

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.580
1 cm or half a centimeter

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.580
Anyway, it's a

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.580
It's a gram-scale small detector

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.580
It's a gram-scale small detector

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.580
So it can block the dark matter

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.580
The rate is very low

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.580
But it is super optimized

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.580
This high-voltage

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.580
Look at the design of the phonon detector

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.580
Then what do you see now

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.580
Is to see the picture on the right

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.580
There is a single peak

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.580
It's 0, 1, 2, 3

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.580
These peaks are all separated

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.580
What is this

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.580
There is a signal in this crystal

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.580
Created a single electron hole pair

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.580
Double, triple electron hole pair

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.580
It can see the quantized electron hole pair

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.580
It can see the quantized electron hole pair

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.580
It can see the quantized electron hole pair

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.580
So this is

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.580
You have to test

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.580
To use HV detector

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.580
Optimal sensitivity

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.580
You can start counting

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.580
Single electron hole pair

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.580
Created by detecting phonon

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.580
So you can see here

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.580
Its energy threshold is super low

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.580
Its energy threshold is super low

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.580
It is 0.33eV

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.580
It can shoot

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.580
It only operates for one day

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.580
It only operates for one day

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.580
Within one day on surface

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.580
And it doesn't even have to go underground

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.580
To cover up those radioactivity

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.580
To cover up those radioactivity

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.580
This is the one I'm going to talk about

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.580
This is the one I'm going to talk about

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.580
This is the one I'm going to talk about

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.580
You can see

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.580
If I can use this

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.580
If I can use this

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.580
Now everyone wants to use this

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.580
Now everyone wants to use this

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.580
High voltage detector

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.580
In order to increase

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.580
It is offered tentest

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.580
It is offered tentest

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.580
It is offered tentest

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.580
It is offered tentest

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:51.580
It is offered tentest

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.580
You see the dots

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.580
You see the dots

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.580
You see the dots

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.580
Now there is a test called Sensai

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.580
Now there is a test called Sensai

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.580
It can do this

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.580
We think that Super CDMX can do

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.580
We think that Super CDMX can do

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.580
It can do

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.580
Lower than EMUV sensitivity

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.580
If we can optimize

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.580
If we can optimize

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.580
It is the nature of HV detector

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.580
It is the nature of HV detector

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.580
I want to skip this page

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.580
I want to skip this page

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.580
Next is that we can optimize

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.580
As I said, the phonon is a super conductor

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.580
As I said, the phonon is a super conductor

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.580
If, It is very sensitive

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.580
As long as it picks up a bit of energy

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.580
It accumulates from the super conductor

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.580
It accumulates from the super conductor

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.580
So we can measure a great change in electrons

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.580
So we can measure a great change in electrons

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.580
And here

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.580
When the plusion picks up the energy

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:49.580
When the plusion picks up the energy

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.580
It is the resistance of the virtual conductor

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.580
It is the resistance of the virtual conductor

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.580
Now if the vector is a super conductor

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.580
Now if the vector is a super conductor

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.580
If we connect it to the capacitor

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.580
It becomes a thermostat

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.580
So if the grand thermostat changes

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:07.580
It turns into the resonant freq

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.580
So if a as you can see on the map

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.580
So if a as you can see on the map

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.580
Today if the cuper pair gets broken

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.580
If the cuper pair gets broken

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.580
and the impedance changes

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.580
The resonant frequency will be different

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.580
The resonant frequency will be different

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.580
The interesting part is that every detector is small

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.580
So I can see the next page

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.580
So I can see the next page

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.580
This is super cdms snowlab detector

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.580
If you look at the bottom left

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.580
If you look at the bottom left

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.580
It has to connect a lot of small dds

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.580
It has to connect a lot of small dds

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.580
It has to connect a lot of small dds

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.580
It has to change the capacitor

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.580
It can make 12 pixels

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.580
Because even if the capacitor is 0

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.580
Because even if the capacitor is 0

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.580
It is still small

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.580
So you have to connect a lot of dds

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.580
So you can see the signal

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.580
So it can only make 12 pixels

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.580
But if you look at the right picture

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.580
This is what we are doing in the lab

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.580
We use the way of super cdms

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.580
We use the way of super cdms

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.580
We can make every small square

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.580
We can make every small square

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.580
So basically we are doing 80,100,200 pixels

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.580
So basically we are doing 80,100,200 pixels

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.580
So this technology has been demonstrated

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.580
So this technology has been demonstrated

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.580
The energy resolution is the same as the TX

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.580
The energy resolution is the same as the TX

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.580
It's very easy to do

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.580
It can save a lot of money

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.580
It can save a lot of money

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.580
It can save a lot of money

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.580
OK that is what we want to do now

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.580
OK that is what we want to do now

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.580
There is also another aspect

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.580
What we kept talking about

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.580
What we kept talking about

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.580
We want to use it as a target

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.580
For dark matter

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.580
For dark matter

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.580
We can measure smaller energy

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.580
We can measure smaller energy

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.580
It's not exactly right

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.580
In fact, we want to do

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.580
We want to do

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.580
We want to do

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.580
First, the primary target

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.580
We want to do

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.580
We want to do

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.580
We want to do

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.580
But second

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.580
It picks up the energy it wants to measure

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.580
It picks up the energy it wants to measure

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.580
It must have an excited state to jump on

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:17.580
That's what we're looking at right now

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.580
That's what we're looking at right now

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.580
Half brain

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:27.580
Except, there are more

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.580
For example, like

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.580
For example, like

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.580
But the temperature will drift

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.580
But the temperature will drift

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.580
But the temperature will drift

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.580
Or like diamonds

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.580
Or like diamonds

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.580
These semiconductors have different bandgaps

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.580
Now a lot of people are thinking

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.580
Can we pick up more fancy materials

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.580
For example, gallium arsenide

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.580
These materials

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.580
To optimize the bandgap

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.580
We can pick up less energy

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.580
We can pick up less energy

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.580
Another interesting thing is

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.580
Germanium silicon is a pure material

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.580
It has no polarization

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.580
But if there is gallium arsenide today

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.580
It will have a very strong dipole

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.580
So it will produce

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.580
I need to supply

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.580
I need to supply

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.580
I just said at the beginning

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.580
If I can supply a single particle

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.580
I can force it to keep running

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.580
There will be a very strong coupling

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.580
So materials like gallium arsenide

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.580
So materials like gallium arsenide

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.580
Axion-like particles or photon coupling

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.580
Axion-like particles or photon coupling

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.580
This is the first

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.580
But I can go further

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.580
Can I find

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.580
Smaller materials

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.580
For example, superconductor

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.580
For example, superconductor

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.580
Or superfluid helium

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.580
Now the bandgap is directly from

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.580
EV to mini-EV

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.580
You can measure very small energy

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.580
This is far future

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.580
This is far future

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.580
If you look at the picture in the lower right corner

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.580
If you look at the picture in the lower right corner

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.580
If you use scattering

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.580
Or EM absorption

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.580
Or EM absorption

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.580
What we are doing now

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.580
What we are doing now

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.580
If you see the semiconductor in the middle

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.580
If you see the semiconductor in the middle

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.580
Or scintillator

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.580
Basically ionization

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.580
Basically ionization

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.580
Traditionally the only thing that can be dug into WIMP

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.580
Traditionally the only thing that can be dug into WIMP

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.580
But in the future

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.580
Many people are thinking to use superfluid

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.580
Many people are thinking to use superfluid

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580
Or superconductor as a target

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.580
This is also a direction

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.580
This is also a direction

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.580
What did I say today?

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.580
Let me summarize

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:43.580
In the dark matter community

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.580
In the dark matter community

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.580
There is a paradigm shift

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.580
From classical WIMP

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.580
Everyone started to pay more attention to low mass dark matter

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.580
Everyone started to pay more attention to low mass dark matter

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.580
For example, in the EV scale

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.580
There may be Daryl, Neutrino

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.580
Or in the MEV, Dark Sector

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.580
There are many models that can be done

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.580
Traditionally, when doing WIMP search in dark matter

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.580
Everyone only cares about nuclear recoil

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.580
Because it's very heavy in that scale

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.580
You just want to hit the nuclear

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.580
You won't have a signal when you hit the electron

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.580
But now everyone is starting to pay attention

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.580
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.580
Electron recoil and nuclear recoil

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.580
It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.580
It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:23.580
It requires substantial improvement in low threshold detector technology

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.580
About this

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.580
I think it's fair to say

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.580
Super CDMX is the best

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.580
Basically, we have iZip

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.580
Can do ERNR discriminating

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.580
Tagging search

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.580
Or I can do

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.580
Ultra low threshold, ultra small energy search

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.580
Ultra low threshold, ultra small energy search

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.580
Future

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.580
I want to be able to measure

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.580
More technology

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.580
Can measure smaller recoil

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.580
I want to have better calibration

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.580
To understand

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.580
How much ratio it has in NR

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.580
You can see ionization

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.580
What we can do now

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.580
Ionization quantum counting detector

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.580
Ionization quantum counting detector

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.580
I just introduced

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.580
In addition to measuring the change of electrons

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.580
Ultrasound sensor

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.580
Can also be used to measure the change of electrons

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.580
It has many benefits

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.580
The most important thing is

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.580
Eventually we want to measure

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.580
Thermorelic lower bound

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.580
Thermorelic lower bound

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.580
Probably KEV

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.580
If I remember correctly

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.580
KEV

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.580
ER

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.580
Electron

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.580
Because I want to have a very light target

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.580
I can maximize my energy

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.580
Thank you

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.580
Um, do you have any questions?

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.580
What is this clip?

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.580
Oh, this is a very good question

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.580
Oh, this is a very good question

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.580
Um

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.580
What is this

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.580
Um, I'm back

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.580
Is this a toy?

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580
Yes, this is a toy

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.580
Look at the bottom right corner of this video

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.580
Look at the bottom right corner of this video

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.580
There is a called the particle zoo

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.580
If you google the particle zoo

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.580
It is a company

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.580
It has a lot of dolls

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.580
All we know

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.580
Hypothetical

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.580
Or all kinds of particles

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.580
Are made into toys

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.580
The black square is dark matter

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.580
All other people

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.580
It's all cotton

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.580
Only dark matter is sand

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.580
Because it is very heavy

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.580
That's probably the concept

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:51.580
But that's because it was a model

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:53.580
I think it can start to sand cotton

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.580
I think it can start to sand cotton

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.580
OK

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:01.580
Is this a business statement?

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.580
No, it's not

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.580
Should not be a business statement

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.580
It's a

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.580
I don't know if it's still running

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.580
It seems to have become a bit like a non-profit

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.580
It's a company that accepts people's donations

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.580
Because business is not good

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.580
It's cool to open a website

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.580
Sorry

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.580
Any other questions?

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.580
Someone asked first

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.580
Then I'll ask first

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.580
Zhang Youning

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.580
Everyone has their own opinion

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.580
What to measure

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.580
Different methods

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.580
Eliminate

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.580
Improving the ratio of information

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.580
Then your

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.580
Talk will talk about it

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.580
Do you have a

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.580
Value or a definition

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.580
Theoretical scientist

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.580
He said

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.580
If we measure something

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.580
Or when we get to a certain value

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.580
We call it measured

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.580
Or

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.580
Prove that there is a dark matter value

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.580
Up to 99.97

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.580
Have

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.580
Basically your question is

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.580
How do I define

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.580
Correct

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.580
The answer is

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.580
The answer is

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:35.580
There are two ways

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.580
You actually don't know

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.580
Your background

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580
What should it look like

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.580
What is the probability

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.580
If so

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.580
Is to put your background

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.580
This rate

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.580
Keep erasing

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.580
It's in you

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.580
It's in you

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.580
Your experiment

01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.580
Then according to your

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.580
The size of the experiment

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.580
Theoretically it should not appear

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.580
Any

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.580
OK

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.580
That

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.580
If it should not appear

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.580
Then today you measured it once

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.580
Then

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.580
I can tell you

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.580
What is the probability of it

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.580
But you measured 30

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.580
Then ask

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.580
How much confidence do you have

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.580
This is from another source

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.580
This is a very common statistic

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.580
Right

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.580
But the key to this whole thing is

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.580
You have to put your background

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.580
You can't see it at all

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.580
You will know when you see it

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.580
The second one

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:43.580
That is

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.580
If you have a background

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.580
Appearance frequency

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.580
Or for a certain parameter

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.580
Parameter you can measure

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.580
There is a certain understanding

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.580
OK

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.580
Then you have a curve

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.580
You can see what you see

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.580
In this parameter you can measure

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.580
Distribution above

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.580
OK

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.580
Then if there is

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.580
A big one

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.580
Beyond your model

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.580
You can't see it

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.580
You will have enough confidence to say

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.580
How much confidence it is

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.580
Is with

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.580
This distribution is not consistent

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.580
Do you understand

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.580
Did I explain

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.580
Um

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.580
I understand

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.580
Just

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.580
You just mentioned

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.580
How much

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.580
My understanding is probably like this

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.580
Um

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.580
Hey i think

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.580
After the noise

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.580
The rest is the signal

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.580
Then the signal is that I have measured

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.580
I'm just curious

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.580
Can you recognize the cup or

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:53.580
Uh

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.580
Things like

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.580
Hey

01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.580
Uh

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.580
I think

01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.580
I think this is the case

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.580
No one should know where it will be measured

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.580
But

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.580
Uh

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.580
What to do now is that you can measure

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.580
A pile of signals

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.580
Then these signals give you enough

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.580
Confidence level

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.580
This is definitely not

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.580
What we expect to see

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.580
Then this is the cup

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.580
Oh

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.580
This is the conclusion, this means that it is a new thing

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.580
By definition it is dark matter

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.580
Right

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.580
Because we don't know

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.580
Super cdms threshold

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.580
5 sigma

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.580
Uh super cdms

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.580
Threshold you mean

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.580
Uh you mean

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.580
Detection or you mean

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.580
Detector itself

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.580
Signal to noise ratio

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.580
Uh i mean you measured the signal

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.580
With the cup

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.580
Oh yeah yeah

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.580
If we are

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.580
Eventually we want to send

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.580
Uh we

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.580
Want to send

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.580
If we want to claim detection

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.580
5 sigma

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.580
But um

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.580
The problem now is

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.580
If we are today

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.580
Not so good

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.580
Or we are

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.580
Select material

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.580
Not so good

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.580
Not very clean

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.580
Eventually

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.580
What is it

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.580
4 events

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.580
You can claim

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.580
I saw an event nearby

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.580
But the confidence level is very low

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.580
Or you can say

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.580
Uh this thing will degrade my limit

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.580
But I assume that I made a mistake

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.580
Uh i don't think

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.580
In the future we will

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.580
Like we used to do

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:49.580
Is that we will say

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.580
Hey we see

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.580
Signal and then we are

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.580
Draw a contour on the limit plot

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.580
But this contour is 90% confidence

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.580
I don't think we will do this in the future

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.580
We used to do this

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:03.580
But we

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.580
Should be quite clear in the future

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.580
We will only say at least 25

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.580
Because 25 is your zero background

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.580
If you are plus on fluctuation

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.580
You should be square root

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.580
At least 25

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.580
We might say uh we claim

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.580
See something

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.580
Uh

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.580
Correct

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.580
Any questions

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.580
Uh i'm curious

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.580
Is you

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.580
After this device is designed

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.580
What kind of experiment is it

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.580
To do validation

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.580
Is to confirm this instrument

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:43.580
Indeed doing what you want

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.580
Want to do

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.580
Just do validation

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.580
Uh i don't know

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.580
How to say

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.580
Um ok

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.580
I think this can go back to the page I just skipped

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.580
Very very messy

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.580
That page

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.580
I thought it might be

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.580
High-performance experiment

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.580
Detector people will be more interested

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.580
So i skipped

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.580
Ok ok what do you see now

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.580
What you see now is

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:15.580
Uh let's just say

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.580
Let's take a look

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.580
Let's just talk about the picture on the right

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.580
The picture on the right

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.580
You see a lot of different colors

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.580
Dot

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.580
This is horizontal

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.580
What you see is

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.580
I'm on the front

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.580
And the opposite side

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.580
Electricity

01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.580
The difference in energy

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.580
Ok so it's

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.580
It's a normalization

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.580
Ok

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.580
That is to say

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.580
The difference in ionization

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.580
Then what you see is

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.580
Phonon and ionization

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.580
The ratio is the one I just said

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.580
One third is nr

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.580
Ok so you see a lot of different colors

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.580
This color is actually added later

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.580
Then you see me now

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.580
Circle up there

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.580
There is a thing called california cf252

01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.580
This is a radiative element

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.580
It will always shoot out the middle finger

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.580
We basically put a middle finger

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.580
Radiator

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.580
Put it on our detector

01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.580
That middle finger keeps hitting

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.580
We think this should be the signal we want to see

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:21.580
It should look like

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.580
Because if today is

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.580
Anything else

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.580
It will act as a battery interaction

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.580
Whether it's gamma ray

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.580
Whether it's IR photon

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.580
Or electron

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.580
Its

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.580
It will be immediately

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.580
Will act as a battery

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.580
Block down

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.580
What you see at this time

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.580
It's not like your dark matter

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:47.580
Dark matter won't do this

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.580
So basically

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.580
What we are looking for is neutral particle

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.580
Then a very strong neutral particle

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.580
Will hit the atomic box

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.580
Then we think this signal

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.580
It's like we can see

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.580
Dark matter

01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.580
So you see this california cf252

01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:05.580
Is neutral source

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.580
So in other words, we can tag it next to it

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.580
It's background

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.580
This comes from a very strong

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.580
EM interaction source

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.580
That's led 210

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.580
So we're the same

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.580
Put led 210 on our detector

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.580
Then see these signals

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.580
Then find out

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:25.580
As we expected

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.580
Where the background should go

01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.580
We basically do this

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:33.580
Does this answer your question?

01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:35.580
Yes

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.580
Then I have another one

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:39.580
A more extensive question is

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.580
If I understand

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:43.580
You guys have been following up

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.580
Able to measure

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:47.580
Because it can measure lighter

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.580
Mass

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:51.580
But if you only use a single

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.580
It's usually neutral

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.580
Then its mass is

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.580
I don't know much about physics

01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.580
But in my impression, it should be

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.580
So you can't confirm

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.580
Your instrument can measure

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.580
Mass

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.580
That's right

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.580
I have to say

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.580
Unless we have a dark matter source

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.580
Can calibrate our detector

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:15.580
Otherwise we will never know

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.580
What it looks like

01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.580
But if we can do that

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.580
We don't have to measure anymore

01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.580
So you're totally right

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.580
So there are some assumptions here

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:27.580
The assumption here is

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.580
We take our neutral to hit it

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:31.580
The energy it leaves

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.580
Energy is energy

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.580
It's not because it's from

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.580
Neutron to hit

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.580
There is a difference

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.580
So what we measured today

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.580
How much energy does it leave

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.580
Then based on this energy

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.580
Say OK

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:49.580
So the response I see in this energy

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.580
Is it the response I expect to see in this energy?

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.580
So basically

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.580
I don't care if it's neutral

01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.580
But this assumption is like this

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.580
If you leave

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.580
For example, 1 keV

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.580
But this 1 keV comes from dark matter or neutron

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.580
In the end, your detector will have a different response

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.580
Then this will be different

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.580
This is a systematic

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.580
But this is the best we can do

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.580
Because we don't have a dark matter source

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.580
I think I understand

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.580
Thank you

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.580
I want to ask a question

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:29.580
That picture can be

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.580
There is a picture of Sigma vs Max

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:33.580
It's behind

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.580
Drawing a lot of different experiments

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.580
This

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.580
I just want to ask

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.580
Just assume

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.580
We want to do a new experiment now

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.580
Or maybe

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.580
Or improve other experiments

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.580
Do you have any suggestions

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.580
For example, because these lines

01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.580
It's probably

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.580
For example, its peak is probably

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.580
It's around 10

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.580
So if we want to do something else later

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.580
For example, further

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.580
Or do other experiments

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.580
You will feel

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.580
For example, we want to prove

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.580
Of course, the further to the left

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:17.580
Or basically

01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.580
For example, the part above the xenon

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.580
Is also the direction we can do

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.580
That is, if

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.580
If you want to do other experiments

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.580
This picture is basically like this

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.580
There are two directions you can go

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.580
Because this is a 2D picture

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.580
So there are two directions you can go

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.580
One is horizontal and one is vertical

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.580
Let's talk about what it means

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.580
It means

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.580
If you go horizontally

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.580
Basically you are in the probe

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.580
Different dark matter mass

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:51.580
If you go down

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.580
It's the same mass in the probe

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.580
But smaller

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:57.580
Smaller

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.580
Interaction cross action

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:01.580
No problem

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.580
But why do these pictures show

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.580
A straight line down

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:09.580
Then diagonally up a straight line

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.580
Triangle

01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.580
This is probably the principle

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.580
Detector has its own noise

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.580
Below this noise

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.580
Then you are completely

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.580
Always noise

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.580
So you can't measure

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.580
You can only be above this line

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.580
That is Trigger Threshold

01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.580
So that Trigger Threshold defines

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.580
The energy you can measure

01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:35.580
In other words, it basically defines

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:37.580
You can measure the smallest particle mass

01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.580
So this is the left one

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.580
Very sharp straight line

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.580
The right side is diagonally up

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.580
This is a log-log picture

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.580
So it's a log-log straight line

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.580
This basically means

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.580
You assume

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.580
The larger the particle mass

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.580
The less you see

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.580
So

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.580
Without seeing or seeing the same rate

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.580
The situation you can set

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.580
The weaker the limit

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.580
Because this principle is very simple

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.580
Because you know we are here

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.580
Is this dark matter

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:11.580
How much is the mass density of Halo

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:13.580
But mass density must be converted

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.580
To number density

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.580
To the mass

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.580
So the heavier the particle

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.580
The less

01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.580
So hit your rate

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.580
Is 1 over m less

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.580
Do you understand

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.580
So the line on the right is probably

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.580
This means

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.580
First, I don't think

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:37.580
Different experiments

01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.580
It should be said that the same experimental technology

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.580
Basically it is set

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:43.580
Where is its Threshold

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.580
So the super straight line on the right

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.580
It's hard to move

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.580
So if you want to change the line on the right

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.580
Basically you have to change

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.580
New technology

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.580
Not to say

01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:59.580
How to get it

01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:01.580
It can run left and right

01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.580
It can only run up and down

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:05.580
Basically these lines can only run up and down

01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:07.580
OK

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.580
Is it 1 over F?

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.580
No no no

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.580
Because this is the mass

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.580
This is the cross section

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.580
So that line basically means

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.580
Your Threshold is there

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:21.580
The gray line on the left

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.580
The line in the area is not

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.580
Which one

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.580
The picture on the right

01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.580
The picture on the left

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.580
Is this

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.580
Yes

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.580
It should not be written on it

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.580
You can follow

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.580
I'll explain that later

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.580
OK

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:43.580
So I don't think

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.580
Use existing technology

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.580
It should not be said that I don't think

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.580
This is a recognition

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.580
Use the same technology

01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:53.580
The bigger you can build

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.580
The more you use

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:57.580
The conclusion is

01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:59.580
In the same time

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.580
In theory, you can block more

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.580
So if you don't block

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.580
You can set a stronger limit

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.580
But basically can't run left and right

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.580
Run left and right

01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.580
Is to use different technology

01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.580
So different technology

01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.580
What is this technology

01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.580
Is to reduce your Threshold

01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.580
So basically what you can find

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.580
Is to find a way to reduce Threshold

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.580
OK

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.580
So in this picture you can see

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.580
The most obvious Threshold

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:29.580
The lowest is the light green

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.580
I point to this place

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.580
Why

01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.580
I think the answer is different from others

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.580
If you go to track

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.580
The label

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:41.580
You will see

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.580
Aluminum SC

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.580
10mEV

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:47.580
What is that

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:49.580
Aluminum superconductor

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:51.580
Its bandgap is 10mEV

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.580
In fact, it is less than 10mEV

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.580
But its order of magnitude is 10mEV

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.580
It can slide over there

01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.580
That

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:01.580
The rest you see

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.580
The light blue, dark blue

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.580
Dark green

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.580
What are these things

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.580
These are all semiconductors

01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.580
So it actually has a label

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.580
What is silicon

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.580
Garlium arsenide

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.580
Silicon

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.580
They just take silicon

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:21.580
In a different way

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.580
Readout or readout or assembly

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.580
They are all over there

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.580
Then it actually has a label

01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:29.580
Its Threshold

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.580
Let me see

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.580
Semiconductor Threshold is 10mEV

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:37.580
10mEV

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:39.580
I personally think

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.580
Go to a smaller Threshold

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.580
And the order of magnitude difference

01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:45.580
Is to change the material

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.580
Now CEMS

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:49.580
I think we are already

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:51.580
Master

01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:53.580
Semiconductor

01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:55.580
Technology

01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:57.580
Yes

01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:59.580
So there may be

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.580
In short, it is

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:03.580
It depends on the signal to noise

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.580
The threshold of noise

01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.580
So basically

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.580
Unless you change the material

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.580
It is unlikely to move

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.580
I think long term is to change the material

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.580
But is it possible to move

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.580
Yes, you can understand

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.580
What is your noise

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:21.580
You can understand what your noise is

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.580
Maybe you can reduce it

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.580
Eventually you can assume

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:27.580
If you are noise-free

01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.580
Probably still around that

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.580
Can you reduce noise

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:33.580
Just in this group

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.580
Semiconductor experiment

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:37.580
Can you be better

01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.580
That's about it

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:41.580
OK

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.580
You can ask

01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.580
It doesn't matter

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.580
You continue

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.580
I just thought

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.580
Dark Matter Halo

01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.580
Because you just said

01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.580
It rotates in the universe

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.580
Then we can accept it

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:03.580
Does it have a number

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.580
For example, like Collider

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.580
Will it be here

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:09.580
It is with the earth

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:11.580
Our detector

01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:13.580
Relative to this

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:15.580
Dark Matter Halo

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.580
How much is the luminosity

01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.580
There is this number

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.580
This can be calculated

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.580
Let me explain

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.580
OK

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.580
What this picture draws

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.580
The solar system is here

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.580
Right

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.580
We know

01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.580
The sun revolves around the Milky Way

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.580
How fast

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:43.580
Right

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:45.580
We also know

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.580
We observe

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.580
Our track

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.580
The quality of the package

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.580
How much is the quality of pulling us

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:55.580
Right

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.580
So we immediately know

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:01.580
How much is there

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.580
Missing mass

01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:05.580
Can it be

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:07.580
But this is total mass

01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:09.580
But if I do

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.580
The same thing

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.580
But I started from the middle of the reactor

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.580
Can I just make

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.580
How to say

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.580
Delta R

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.580
How much is it

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.580
Do I know

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:25.580
Every radius

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.580
Dark Matter Density

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.580
How much

01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.580
Right

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.580
How much

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.580
How much

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.580
How fast

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.580
I know

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.580
How much

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:43.580
How much

01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:45.580
The only difference is

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.580
I don't know how heavy this particle is

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:49.580
So number density

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.580
You have to assume a mass

01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:53.580
So number density

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.580
Basically depends on your model

01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.580
But we actually know

01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.580
What is this

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.580
Mass density

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.580
That's it

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:05.580
So that's model

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.580
Independent

01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.580
But basically

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.580
But basically when we draw

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.580
Is to draw all the mass

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:15.580
A point becomes a line

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.580
I don't know how much this mass is

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:19.580
Every mass I draw

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.580
It becomes a line

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:23.580
OK

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.580
it is good

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.580
OK

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:31.580
OK

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:33.580
That should be the same

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:35.580
Thank you

01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:37.580
OK

01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.580
Time is almost up today

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:43.580
Do you have any questions

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:45.580
I have some questions

01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.580
Can I ask

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.580
I have a little suggestion

01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.580
I'm totally OK

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.580
Stay and ask questions

01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.580
But because California is almost 9 o'clock

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:01.580
If the host wants to go home

01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:03.580
Can go home

01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.580
I don't know where you are now

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.580
Anyway

01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.580
If you want to download it, you can download it

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.580
Anyway, the recording is over

01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.580
Then we can continue to discuss

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.580
I am actually

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:19.580
I have one or two questions

01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:21.580
but

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:23.580
I don't know if everyone has

01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.580
That's it

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.580
Let's continue

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.580
I have a personal article

01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.580
OK

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.580
OK

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.580
OK

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.580
Then I will stop the recording first

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.580
OK
