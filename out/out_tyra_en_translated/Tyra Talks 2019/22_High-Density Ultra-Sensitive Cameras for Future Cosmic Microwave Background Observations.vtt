00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the last Tera Talk this year.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We are honored to have Dr. He Shuai-Pu at Princeton University.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
He is going to talk about Large Millimeter Volumetric Array for CMB Observation.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Let me introduce Dr. He first.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
He got his Ph.D. in Physics at Princeton in 2017.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
He is now working as a postdoc at Princeton.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
His main focus is Experimental Cosmology.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
His main work is Detector and Readout Development.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
He has participated in several flagship CMB experiments.

00:50.000 --> 01:02.000
Such as ABS-Atacama BMO Search, ACT-POL, Advanced ACT, Simons Observatory, and CMBS-POL.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Before I start, I'd like to say that

01:08.000 --> 01:20.000
our goal is to share our progress with Taiwanese students around the world.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
We hope to increase the opportunities for cooperation and exchange.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
If you are interested in participating in our project,

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
we hope you can sign up for our talk next year.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
You can sign up for our talk on our Facebook page.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. He.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Hello, everyone.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm going to talk about Large Millimeter Volumetric Array for CMB Observation.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
The topics I'm going to cover are mainly two experiments.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
You can see ACT-POL on the right side of the page.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
There are some collaborations.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
They are mainly founded by NSF and Chile Conocet.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
The other one is Simons Observatory.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
You can see that the collaboration has become larger.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
It's mainly founded by Simons Foundation.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Okay, let's move on.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
There is a beautiful starry sky with our telescope.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
You may be familiar with this picture.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
On the left is the starting point, Big Ben.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Of course, there is an argument.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
There is no Big Ben.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
As time goes by, it becomes where we are now.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
I mainly study cosmic background radiation, CMB.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
It is the first light we can see.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
It originated about 400,000 years ago.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Or 380,000 years ago.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
What can we learn from this study?

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
When we look at CMB,

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
the first thing we look at is its intensity.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
This is Planck's intensity map.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
There are hot spots and cold spots.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It is a full sky observation.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
In addition to intensity,

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
there is a weak signal, polarization.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
It is mainly from electrons and photons.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
There is Thomson scattering,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
which causes linear polarization.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
When we observe this polarization directly,

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
you will see a cross mark on the left.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
There is a 45-degree cross mark on the right.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
This is called Q and U.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
This is the map we can observe most directly.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
This means that we have observed polarization.

04:47.000 --> 04:56.000
We usually convert it into E mode and B mode.

04:56.000 --> 05:15.000
You can see that E mode has symmetry and B mode does not.

05:16.000 --> 05:26.000
This is the map we can observe most directly.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
We usually convert it into E mode and B mode.

05:29.000 --> 05:47.000
You can see that the temperature of the power spectrum is 10³µKv².

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
It is actually a very weak signal.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
But the signal of polarization is smaller,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
about one tenth or less.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
So we can measure the temperature very precisely.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
But when you want to measure polarization,

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
you need a more sensitive instrument to detect it more accurately.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
This is a theory model.

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
And this is the data obtained from recent experiments.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
This is a map of the universe.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
If we look at the CMB directly,

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
we can know how old the universe is.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Although we know that the universe is more than 400,000 years old,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
we want to know more precisely.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
The shape of the universe and its structural formation.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
But we also have more secondary anisotropy to understand.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
Because light passes through so many things in the middle and reaches our eyes.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
We can know some secondary effects from it.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
For example, gravitational lensing or SZ effect.

07:29.000 --> 07:42.000
We can also know that there are some stars or galaxies in the middle of the universe.

07:42.000 --> 07:52.000
So why is it difficult to measure CMB?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
As I said earlier,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
just look at the temperature and anisotropy,

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
the temperature signal is about 10 to the 3 microKelvin squared.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
You can see that there is a Cyan line here.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
But in between CMB and our eyes,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
there are many other things in the middle.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
The main components of CMB are dust and synchrotron.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
The red band and the green line.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
When you see the polarization signal is weaker,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
you can see that the impact of dust and synchrotron is deeper.

08:39.000 --> 08:47.000
This means that we need a way to decompose the different components.

08:47.000 --> 08:58.000
To understand the character of dust and synchrotron at different frequencies.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Then you can remove it to get pure CMB.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
Therefore, when we develop instruments,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
we need to have different frequency bands.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
The more cover, the more frequency band.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
The more cover, the more sky.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
In this way, we can remove these extra signals to get pure CMB.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
From the beginning,

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
of course, there are so many dust and synchrotron in the outer space.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
You don't want to interfere with your observations from other sources.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
So, the cleanest way is to transfer everything to outer space.

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
There is COBE satellite, WMAP, and Planck.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
You can see that the sensitivity is getting higher and higher.

10:01.000 --> 10:10.000
But sending everything to outer space is a very expensive thing.

10:11.000 --> 10:21.000
Another way is to build a telescope on the earth.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
But that requires a longer period of time.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
And your instrument needs to be more sensitive.

10:31.000 --> 10:40.000
So, there are two main places where we build telescopes to observe CMB.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
One is Atacama Desert, Chile.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
The other is Antarctica.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
In Atacama Desert and Chile,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
there are ACT, Polar Bear, and Klaus.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
They are mainly focused on CMB observation.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
In Antarctica, there are mainly SPT, BICEP, and Keck Array.

10:59.000 --> 11:10.000
So, in the five ground-based experiments we just talked about,

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
the technology we use is called Transition Edge Sensor, or TES.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
TES is a barometer.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
When the photon comes in,

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
the barometer has a weak thermal path to the T bath.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
When the photon comes in,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
the temperature of TES will rise.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
TES is a very sharp transition.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
When the temperature of TES rises,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
the resistance of TES also rises.

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
The dual power of TES will decrease.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
TES is in a stable state.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
How do you read the signal of TES?

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
We use a coupler to an inductor.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
The inductor is coupled to the screen to amplify the signal.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
This is a simple way to read the signal.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
What does TES look like?

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
This is a typical TES design.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
You can see that TES is in the middle.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
The temperature of TES depends on its material.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
The temperature of TES depends on its material.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
We have just mentioned the two cases.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
We have just mentioned the two cases.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
We want to maintain a certain temperature,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
we want to maintain a certain temperature,.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.880
The primary weak point of TES material is its thinness of silicon nitride leg.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.880
This is why we call it TES Island,

13:17.880 --> 13:23.880
because it is made up of four supporting legs,

13:23.880 --> 13:27.880
and the fabrication is very delicate.

13:27.880 --> 13:33.880
C stands for Thermal Conductance or Thermal Conductivity,

13:33.880 --> 13:37.880
and Platinum Gold.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.880
C stands for Heat Capacity.

13:41.880 --> 13:49.880
We control the amount of Platinum Gold in the TES Island

13:49.880 --> 13:53.880
to determine its heat capacity.

13:53.880 --> 14:01.880
The width of the TES is 280 microns,

14:01.880 --> 14:05.880
and the length is twice that,

14:05.880 --> 14:09.880
560 or 600 microns.

14:09.880 --> 14:13.880
It is a very tiny component.

14:13.880 --> 14:19.880
We use TES to measure the CMB signal.

14:19.880 --> 14:29.880
The main CMB observations are measured by TES.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.880
Since 2009,

14:33.880 --> 14:37.880
we have been building these experiments.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.880
As time goes by,

14:41.880 --> 14:49.880
there are more and more detectors on the telescope.

14:49.880 --> 14:57.880
This is because our TES technology has reached a limit.

14:57.880 --> 15:03.880
This means that the current TES is already in good condition.

15:03.880 --> 15:09.880
How do you enhance the sensitivity of the telescope?

15:09.880 --> 15:13.880
The more detectors on the telescope, the better.

15:13.880 --> 15:25.880
We have used up to 3,000 or 3,000,000 detectors.

15:25.880 --> 15:43.880
This is a map of Atacama Desert, Chile.

15:43.880 --> 15:49.880
It is a very desolate area.

15:49.880 --> 15:57.880
The sky is very clean,

15:57.880 --> 16:05.880
and there is little dust.

16:05.880 --> 16:15.880
We live in a 2,500-meter-high desert.

16:15.880 --> 16:23.880
The act, polar bear, and Klaus are on top of the mountain.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.880
The act is on the left,

16:27.880 --> 16:31.880
the polar bear is on the top, and Klaus is on the bottom.

16:31.880 --> 16:35.880
This mountain is about 5,200 meters high.

16:35.880 --> 16:39.880
This is our act telescope.

16:39.880 --> 16:45.880
The main component of this telescope is that we have a ground screen outside,

16:45.880 --> 16:49.880
which is about 12 meters high.

16:49.880 --> 16:55.880
We want to reduce silo or pick up from the ground.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.880
We built a ground screen outside our telescope.

16:59.880 --> 17:03.880
We have a primary mirror and a secondary mirror.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.880
The primary mirror is about 6 meters in diameter.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.880
The secondary mirror is about 2 meters in diameter.

17:11.880 --> 17:17.880
The resolution of the entire telescope is 1.4 seconds.

17:17.880 --> 17:27.880
The receiver is at the tip of the arrow.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.880
The field of view is 1 degree.

17:31.880 --> 17:37.880
We use a dilution refrigerator,

17:37.880 --> 17:41.880
which allows continuous operation of 100 millikelvin,

17:41.880 --> 17:49.880
which is very important for sensitive detector functionality.

17:49.880 --> 17:57.880
This is one of the tubes.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.880
There are three tubes in the receiver.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.880
From 300K, which is room temperature,

18:05.880 --> 18:09.880
all the way down to 100 millikelvin.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.880
My main job is to focus on the array module of 100 millikelvin.

18:13.880 --> 18:19.880
The picture shown above is the act camera of different generations.

18:19.880 --> 18:27.880
What did we put in the act?

18:27.880 --> 18:35.880
In 2013, the camera in the act was called M-Vac.

18:35.880 --> 18:41.880
I was involved in the act since 2013.

18:41.880 --> 18:49.880
I was involved in the act since 2013.

18:49.880 --> 18:55.880
I was involved in the act since 2013.

18:55.880 --> 19:01.880
The central frequency of the detector is 150 GHz,

19:01.880 --> 19:07.880
or 90 to 150 GHz.

19:07.880 --> 19:11.880
These are all polarimeters,

19:11.880 --> 19:15.880
which can observe two polarizations at the same time.

19:15.880 --> 19:21.880
These are all polarimeters,

19:21.880 --> 19:27.880
which can observe two polarizations at the same time.

19:27.880 --> 19:33.880
M-Vac can only observe intensity.

19:33.880 --> 19:39.880
Since the beginning of PA3,

19:39.880 --> 19:45.880
we can observe two polarizations at the same time.

19:45.880 --> 19:51.880
We can observe two polarizations at the same time.

19:51.880 --> 19:59.880
We can observe two polarizations at the same time.

19:59.880 --> 20:05.880
We can use the same pixel to double the detector count.

20:05.880 --> 20:11.880
We can use the same pixel to double the detector count.

20:11.880 --> 20:17.880
Since 2016, we have upgraded to Advanced Act.

20:17.880 --> 20:23.880
Since 2016, we have upgraded to Advanced Act.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.600
Interactions

20:26.600 --> 20:32.600
Interactions

20:32.600 --> 20:36.600
Synchronous Congistion

20:36.600 --> 20:40.600
Synchronous Congistion

20:40.600 --> 20:44.600
Synchronous Congistion

20:44.600 --> 20:48.600
Synchronous Congistion

20:48.600 --> 20:52.600
Yama is the logo of AQPoL

20:52.600 --> 20:56.600
Miss Katya is the logo of AQPoL

20:56.600 --> 21:00.600
Miss Katya is a cute mouse

21:00.600 --> 21:02.600
I have a question

21:02.600 --> 21:06.600
I think your logo is super cute

21:06.600 --> 21:10.600
My question is

21:10.600 --> 21:14.600
If you have different bands

21:14.600 --> 21:16.600
You can observe them

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
You can keep averaging

21:18.600 --> 21:20.600
And the noise will get lower and lower

21:20.600 --> 21:22.600
If you have multi-band

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
Can you keep reducing the noise

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
And increase the sensitivity?

21:26.600 --> 21:30.600
Or will it be limited by dust?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.600
Or will it be limited by dust?

21:32.600 --> 21:40.600
I think it's limited by technology

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
That's what CMBS4 wants to do

21:42.600 --> 21:46.600
We want to put more than

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
What I'm showing now

21:48.600 --> 21:50.600
More than two-digit

21:50.600 --> 21:52.600
More than two-digit

21:52.600 --> 21:54.600
Detector count

21:54.600 --> 21:58.600
They want to observe for five to ten years

21:58.600 --> 22:00.600
They want to observe for five to ten years

22:00.600 --> 22:02.600
The length to be observed

22:02.600 --> 22:04.600
Has something to do with your funding source

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
Has something to do with your funding source

22:06.600 --> 22:10.600
We haven't reached that limit yet

22:10.600 --> 22:12.600
We haven't reached that limit yet

22:12.600 --> 22:14.600
So at least

22:14.600 --> 22:16.600
From this chart

22:16.600 --> 22:18.600
Let's start from mid-2016

22:18.600 --> 22:20.600
Because the Advanced AQPoL

22:20.600 --> 22:22.600
At least it's not cut off

22:22.600 --> 22:24.600
It's extended to the outside

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
So at least in the years after 2020

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
As long as you continue to observe

22:28.600 --> 22:30.600
The sensitivity can keep going down

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
Upward

22:32.600 --> 22:34.600
That's what it means

22:34.600 --> 22:36.600
Thank you

22:36.600 --> 22:38.600
But in 2021

22:38.600 --> 22:40.600
It's supposed to be decommissioned

22:46.600 --> 22:48.600
Now

22:48.600 --> 22:50.600
Let's move on to

22:50.600 --> 22:52.600
Let's move on to

22:52.600 --> 22:54.600
The left side of the chart

22:54.600 --> 22:56.600
The left side of the chart

22:56.600 --> 22:58.600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

22:58.600 --> 23:00.600
There's a little square

23:00.600 --> 23:02.600
That's our so-called pixel

23:02.600 --> 23:04.600
That's our so-called pixel

23:04.600 --> 23:06.600
What's the component in this pixel?

23:06.600 --> 23:08.600
You can see the TS I just showed

23:08.600 --> 23:10.600
You can see the TS I just showed

23:10.600 --> 23:12.600
The left side is called yts and xts

23:12.600 --> 23:14.600
The left side is called yts and xts

23:14.600 --> 23:16.600
They are measured in different polarizations

23:16.600 --> 23:18.600
They are measured in different polarizations

23:18.600 --> 23:20.600
How does it know

23:20.600 --> 23:22.600
What is the accepted polarization

23:22.600 --> 23:24.600
We use the one in the middle called

23:24.600 --> 23:26.600
Orthomode transducer

23:26.600 --> 23:28.600
Like a arrow

23:28.600 --> 23:30.600
Like a arrow

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
Light hits

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
Light hits

23:34.600 --> 23:36.600
And they go up and down

23:36.600 --> 23:38.600
And they go up and down

23:38.600 --> 23:40.600
And one go to the left and right direction

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
And they go to the left and right direction

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
Then there are some on-trip filters

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
Then there are some on-trip filters

23:58.600 --> 24:00.600
And  sink to TS

24:00.600 --> 24:02.600
And sink to TS

24:02.600 --> 24:04.600
The bottoms are the channel on-trip filter

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
The bottoms are the channel on-trip filter

24:22.600 --> 24:24.600
You can separate by 2 pixel

24:24.600 --> 24:26.600
You can separate by 2 pixel

24:26.600 --> 24:28.600
Let 2 ff

24:28.600 --> 24:30.600
Let 2 ff

24:30.600 --> 24:32.600
The number left 4tx

24:32.600 --> 24:34.600
The number left 2tx

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
The number left 4tx

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
The number left 4tx

24:38.600 --> 24:40.600
The number left 150 Ghz

24:40.600 --> 24:42.600
The number left 90 GHz

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
The number left 90 Ghz

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
The number left 90 Ghz

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
The number left Google Sachan

24:50.600 --> 24:54.600
The numbers on the right

24:54.600 --> 24:56.600
The numbers on the left

24:56.600 --> 25:00.600
Size is different

25:00.600 --> 25:02.600
I have a question

25:02.600 --> 25:04.600
Usually your bandwidth is how many?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.600
I think it's

25:12.600 --> 25:14.600
False 20

25:20.600 --> 25:22.600
Yes, so it's the bandwidth

25:22.600 --> 25:26.600
We will design the bandwidth

25:26.600 --> 25:30.600
Don't go to 0.2 line or 0.2 line

25:30.600 --> 25:34.600
That's what we want to avoid

25:34.600 --> 25:38.600
We can control our bandwidth

25:40.600 --> 25:44.600
2.30 is on a 0.2 line

25:46.600 --> 25:50.600
Yes, but we didn't avoid it

25:50.600 --> 25:52.600
Our design is 2.20

25:52.600 --> 25:54.600
So the bandwidth is super narrow

25:54.600 --> 25:58.600
20 is 1.50 or 1.90

25:58.600 --> 26:00.600
They might have more error

26:04.600 --> 26:06.600
So on-chip filter

26:06.600 --> 26:08.600
I will talk about it later

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
On-chip filter is important

26:10.600 --> 26:18.600
Because it controls the most precise bandwidth

26:18.600 --> 26:20.600
Like our VHORN

26:20.600 --> 26:22.600
And some optics

26:22.600 --> 26:24.600
To control other bands

26:24.600 --> 26:28.600
So after the optical design

26:28.600 --> 26:30.600
We will make sure it doesn't cross

26:30.600 --> 26:32.600
The side region we don't want

26:38.600 --> 26:40.600
Here you can see

26:40.600 --> 26:42.600
The right one

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
The OMT size is only 1.3

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
And the left one

26:46.600 --> 26:48.600
The OMT size is 2mm

26:48.600 --> 26:50.600
So you might think

26:50.600 --> 26:52.600
What does it matter

26:52.600 --> 26:54.600
Well

26:54.600 --> 26:56.600
OMT is a film

26:56.600 --> 26:58.600
A film

26:58.600 --> 27:00.600
The circle part

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
Is transparent

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
It's a very thin film

27:04.600 --> 27:06.600
And this film

27:06.600 --> 27:08.600
Is like a metal

27:08.600 --> 27:10.600
On the film

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
So you need to control

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
The film

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
On 1.3mm

27:16.600 --> 27:18.600
You can imagine

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
How hard it is

27:20.600 --> 27:22.600
To grow the film

27:22.600 --> 27:24.600
On a 6-inch wafer

27:24.600 --> 27:26.600
Or 4-inch wafer

27:26.600 --> 27:28.600
It's not easy

27:32.600 --> 27:34.600
The left one

27:34.600 --> 27:36.600
Is the first generation

27:36.600 --> 27:38.600
Pixel

27:38.600 --> 27:40.600
And the second generation

27:40.600 --> 27:42.600
On the wafer

27:44.600 --> 27:46.600
Our wafer

27:46.600 --> 27:48.600
Is 3-inch

27:48.600 --> 27:50.600
75mm

27:50.600 --> 27:52.600
Now we move the technique

27:52.600 --> 27:54.600
To 6-inch

27:54.600 --> 27:56.600
Wafer

27:56.600 --> 27:58.600
We want to

27:58.600 --> 28:00.600
Closely packed

28:00.600 --> 28:02.600
Pixels on the wafer

28:02.600 --> 28:04.600
So you can see

28:04.600 --> 28:06.600
Instead of a square packed

28:06.600 --> 28:08.600
Square design

28:08.600 --> 28:10.600
We have a

28:10.600 --> 28:12.600
Rhombus

28:12.600 --> 28:14.600
Rhombus

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
Pixel design

28:16.600 --> 28:18.600
So we can put more

28:18.600 --> 28:20.600
Detectors on it

28:20.600 --> 28:22.600
And

28:22.600 --> 28:24.600
The left one

28:24.600 --> 28:26.600
3-inch

28:26.600 --> 28:28.600
Wafer

28:28.600 --> 28:30.600
We can only put

28:30.600 --> 28:32.600
244 channels

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
But the 150mm

28:34.600 --> 28:36.600
6-inch wafer

28:36.600 --> 28:38.600
We can read out

28:38.600 --> 28:40.600
More than 2000 channels

28:40.600 --> 28:42.600
One channel is one TES

28:42.600 --> 28:44.600
So you can see

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
Double the size

28:46.600 --> 28:48.600
We want to

28:48.600 --> 28:50.600
Push the sensitivity

28:50.600 --> 28:52.600
So we have to

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
Put more detectors

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
On the fixed focal plane

28:56.600 --> 28:58.600
This is what I just said

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
Detectors

29:00.600 --> 29:02.600
In addition to on-chip filter

29:02.600 --> 29:04.600
The OMT

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
OMT is

29:06.600 --> 29:08.600
Under the right image

29:08.600 --> 29:10.600
OMT couple detector

29:10.600 --> 29:12.600
It couple to

29:12.600 --> 29:14.600
Feehorn

29:14.600 --> 29:16.600
Feehorn

29:16.600 --> 29:18.600
It's a cone-shaped

29:18.600 --> 29:20.600
It can control

29:20.600 --> 29:22.600
Your light path

29:22.600 --> 29:24.600
From the top

29:24.600 --> 29:26.600
To the OMT

29:26.600 --> 29:28.600
You don't want

29:28.600 --> 29:30.600
The light go through the OMT

29:30.600 --> 29:32.600
You want to

29:32.600 --> 29:34.600
Make best use of

29:34.600 --> 29:36.600
The light source

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
So you have to put a

29:38.600 --> 29:40.600
Facture

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
Like a cover

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
To make sure

29:44.600 --> 29:46.600
The light will not

29:46.600 --> 29:48.600
Go through the OMT

29:48.600 --> 29:50.600
And make extra noise

29:50.600 --> 29:52.600
To your signal

29:52.600 --> 29:54.600
All of these

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
Are made out of

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
Silicon

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
The horn array

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
We take

30:02.600 --> 30:04.600
500 microns

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
Wafers

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
And we use

30:08.600 --> 30:10.600
Three

30:10.600 --> 30:12.600
Three edges

30:12.600 --> 30:14.600
To make a circle

30:14.600 --> 30:16.600
And

30:16.600 --> 30:18.600
Each layer

30:18.600 --> 30:20.600
Has a circle size

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
We call it silicon horn array

30:22.600 --> 30:24.600
The main reason

30:24.600 --> 30:26.600
To use silicon

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
Is to make a thermal match

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
With the detector wafer

30:30.600 --> 30:32.600
We want to make sure

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
There won't be any thermal

30:34.600 --> 30:36.600
Contraction issue

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
And make the detector break

30:38.600 --> 30:40.600
So

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
This picture is

30:44.600 --> 30:46.600
To show

30:46.600 --> 30:48.600
How to read out

30:48.600 --> 30:50.600
With detector array

30:50.600 --> 30:52.600
And

30:52.600 --> 30:54.600
It's not

30:54.600 --> 30:56.600
About reading out

30:56.600 --> 30:58.600
But

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
About

31:00.600 --> 31:02.600
How cumbersome

31:02.600 --> 31:04.600
The assembly is

31:08.600 --> 31:10.600
So we have a detector wafer

31:10.600 --> 31:12.600
And we put it

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
On a base

31:14.600 --> 31:16.600
And we need to

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
Do a lot of

31:18.600 --> 31:20.600
Wire bond

31:20.600 --> 31:22.600
To make a connection

31:22.600 --> 31:24.600
To

31:24.600 --> 31:26.600
Silicon component

31:26.600 --> 31:28.600
So we can connect it

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
To

31:30.600 --> 31:32.600
100mC stage

31:32.600 --> 31:34.600
So we need to

31:34.600 --> 31:36.600
Push it layer by layer

31:36.600 --> 31:38.600
To 1k, 4k, 40k

31:38.600 --> 31:40.600
And

31:40.600 --> 31:42.600
Eventually to room temperature

31:42.600 --> 31:44.600
So

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
It usually

31:46.600 --> 31:48.600
Takes about

31:48.600 --> 31:50.600
A year

31:50.600 --> 31:52.600
To make an array

31:52.600 --> 31:54.600
On the left

31:54.600 --> 31:56.600
Is the array

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
And on the right

31:58.600 --> 32:00.600
Is the advanced array

32:00.600 --> 32:02.600
And

32:02.600 --> 32:04.600
For Ack

32:04.600 --> 32:06.600
The average time

32:06.600 --> 32:08.600
To make an array

32:08.600 --> 32:10.600
Is about a year

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
Usually

32:12.600 --> 32:14.600
You will

32:14.600 --> 32:16.600
Start the next

32:16.600 --> 32:18.600
Array assembly

32:18.600 --> 32:20.600
And

32:20.600 --> 32:22.600
At the same time

32:22.600 --> 32:24.600
You can put it

32:24.600 --> 32:26.600
On the base

32:26.600 --> 32:28.600
So

32:28.600 --> 32:30.600
In summary

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
We have

32:32.600 --> 32:34.600
PA1 and PA2

32:34.600 --> 32:36.600
We have

32:36.600 --> 32:38.600
1000 TS detector

32:38.600 --> 32:40.600
PA3 has 1000 TS detector

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
But

32:44.600 --> 32:46.600
PA1 and

32:46.600 --> 32:48.600
PA2 have 1000 TS detector

32:48.600 --> 32:50.600
PA3 has 1000 TS detector

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
And

32:52.600 --> 32:54.600
For EO

32:54.600 --> 32:56.600
The more you know

32:56.600 --> 32:58.600
The more time you spend

32:58.600 --> 33:00.600
And the more you learn

33:00.600 --> 33:02.600
So it's bad at first

33:02.600 --> 33:04.600
But it gets better

33:04.600 --> 33:06.600
50%, 70%, 80%

33:06.600 --> 33:08.600
And

33:08.600 --> 33:10.600
For

33:10.600 --> 33:12.600
Advanced Ack

33:12.600 --> 33:14.600
PA4

33:14.600 --> 33:16.600
HF array

33:16.600 --> 33:18.600
HF array is

33:18.600 --> 33:20.600
220GHz and

33:20.600 --> 33:22.600
150GHz

33:22.600 --> 33:24.600
And

33:24.600 --> 33:26.600
HF array

33:26.600 --> 33:28.600
Has 2000 TS

33:28.600 --> 33:30.600
And

33:30.600 --> 33:32.600
MF array

33:32.600 --> 33:34.600
Has 90GHz and

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
150GHz

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
And

33:38.600 --> 33:40.600
MF array

33:40.600 --> 33:42.600
Has 1700 TS

33:42.600 --> 33:44.600
And

33:44.600 --> 33:46.600
It's

33:46.600 --> 33:48.600
Improved

33:48.600 --> 33:50.600
For EO

33:50.600 --> 33:52.600
The same result

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
For PA4

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
70%

33:56.600 --> 33:58.600
For PA6

33:58.600 --> 34:00.600
90%

34:00.600 --> 34:02.600
And

34:02.600 --> 34:04.600
For EO

34:04.600 --> 34:06.600
For TS

34:06.600 --> 34:08.600
Sensitivity

34:08.600 --> 34:10.600
If the array

34:10.600 --> 34:12.600
Is only 50%

34:12.600 --> 34:14.600
You have to

34:14.600 --> 34:16.600
Observe

34:16.600 --> 34:18.600
The device

34:18.600 --> 34:20.600
Or

34:20.600 --> 34:22.600
Put the same array

34:22.600 --> 34:24.600
To get the same sensitivity

34:24.600 --> 34:26.600
So we want to

34:26.600 --> 34:28.600
Achieve 100% EO

34:28.600 --> 34:30.600
But for CMB

34:30.600 --> 34:32.600
Camera

34:32.600 --> 34:34.600
This is

34:34.600 --> 34:36.600
The best

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
I haven't heard of

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
95%

34:40.600 --> 34:42.600
I have a question

34:42.600 --> 34:44.600
What is

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
The main problem

34:46.600 --> 34:48.600
For EO

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
Wirebond?

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
Mainly for wirebond

34:52.600 --> 34:54.600
And

34:54.600 --> 34:56.600
Readout

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
Readout component

34:58.600 --> 35:00.600
It's hard to fabricate

35:00.600 --> 35:02.600
It needs

35:02.600 --> 35:04.600
Many steps

35:04.600 --> 35:06.600
So usually

35:06.600 --> 35:08.600
For EO

35:08.600 --> 35:10.600
And

35:10.600 --> 35:12.600
For readout

35:12.600 --> 35:14.600
It's a problem

35:14.600 --> 35:16.600
You can see

35:16.600 --> 35:18.600
Interconnect

35:18.600 --> 35:20.600
Flexible cables

35:20.600 --> 35:22.600
And

35:22.600 --> 35:24.600
Usually

35:24.600 --> 35:26.600
Wirebond

35:26.600 --> 35:28.600
To

35:28.600 --> 35:30.600
Detector

35:30.600 --> 35:32.600
Or readout

35:32.600 --> 35:34.600
The failure

35:34.600 --> 35:36.600
Contribute

35:36.600 --> 35:38.600
Thank you

35:38.600 --> 35:40.600
So

35:40.600 --> 35:42.600
Your squid

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
Is made by NIST?

35:44.600 --> 35:46.600
Our squid is made by NIST

35:46.600 --> 35:48.600
I see, thank you

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
I haven't mentioned

35:50.600 --> 35:52.600
Readout

35:52.600 --> 35:54.600
It's another in our talk

35:54.600 --> 35:56.600
But our app

35:56.600 --> 35:58.600
Mainly uses TDM

35:58.600 --> 36:00.600
Time domain multiplexing

36:00.600 --> 36:02.600
I haven't mentioned multiplexing

36:02.600 --> 36:04.600
But

36:04.600 --> 36:06.600
With so many detectors

36:06.600 --> 36:08.600
It's impossible to readout

36:08.600 --> 36:10.600
So we need to do multiplexing

36:10.600 --> 36:12.600
You need to group

36:12.600 --> 36:14.600
Some detectors

36:14.600 --> 36:16.600
And readout

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
To

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
Speed up

36:20.600 --> 36:22.600
Data speed

36:22.600 --> 36:24.600
The last

36:24.600 --> 36:26.600
LF array

36:26.600 --> 36:28.600
Will be released in January

36:28.600 --> 36:30.600
This array

36:30.600 --> 36:32.600
Is challenging

36:32.600 --> 36:34.600
You can see

36:34.600 --> 36:36.600
The same wave

36:36.600 --> 36:38.600
But not many pixels

36:38.600 --> 36:40.600
And each

36:40.600 --> 36:42.600
OMT

36:42.600 --> 36:44.600
Let me see

36:44.600 --> 36:46.600
Every OMT

36:46.600 --> 36:48.600
Is much bigger

36:48.600 --> 36:50.600
Compared with

36:50.600 --> 36:52.600
MF and HF

36:52.600 --> 36:54.600
About 1 cm

36:54.600 --> 36:56.600
As i said

36:56.600 --> 36:58.600
The transparent part

36:58.600 --> 37:00.600
Is membrane

37:00.600 --> 37:02.600
This membrane

37:02.600 --> 37:04.600
Distress

37:04.600 --> 37:06.600
And metal

37:06.600 --> 37:08.600
It's a

37:08.600 --> 37:10.600
Difficult technology

37:10.600 --> 37:12.600
So

37:12.600 --> 37:14.600
It's challenging

37:14.600 --> 37:16.600
In R&D

37:16.600 --> 37:18.600
But we made it

37:18.600 --> 37:20.600
And

37:20.600 --> 37:22.600
Initial testing result

37:22.600 --> 37:24.600
Is reasonable

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
We will release it in January

37:26.600 --> 37:28.600
Hopefully

37:28.600 --> 37:30.600
I see some light

37:32.600 --> 37:34.600
The next one

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
Is Simon's Observatory

37:36.600 --> 37:38.600
I was talking about

37:38.600 --> 37:40.600
Act

37:40.600 --> 37:42.600
Our new plan

37:42.600 --> 37:44.600
Is to build

37:44.600 --> 37:46.600
A new observatory

37:46.600 --> 37:48.600
Next to Act

37:50.600 --> 37:52.600
This observatory

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
Is mainly

37:54.600 --> 37:56.600
Composed by

37:56.600 --> 37:58.600
On the right

37:58.600 --> 38:00.600
We call it

38:00.600 --> 38:02.600
Large Aperture Telescope

38:02.600 --> 38:04.600
L-A-T

38:04.600 --> 38:06.600
It's a 6m cross-dragon

38:06.600 --> 38:08.600
Telescope

38:10.600 --> 38:12.600
L-A-T

38:12.600 --> 38:14.600
Let us see

38:14.600 --> 38:16.600
Small-scale signal

38:16.600 --> 38:18.600
Act is sensitive

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
To the power spectrum

38:20.600 --> 38:22.600
L is greater than 200

38:22.600 --> 38:24.600
To

38:24.600 --> 38:26.600
Above

38:26.600 --> 38:28.600
The power spectrum

38:28.600 --> 38:30.600
So

38:30.600 --> 38:32.600
Usually

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
You want to build it bigger and bigger

38:34.600 --> 38:36.600
So

38:36.600 --> 38:38.600
So

38:38.600 --> 38:40.600
And

38:40.600 --> 38:42.600
It's limited by technology

38:42.600 --> 38:44.600
So

38:44.600 --> 38:46.600
This telescope

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
Is designed

38:48.600 --> 38:50.600
13 optics tubes

38:50.600 --> 38:52.600
But

38:52.600 --> 38:54.600
We will only put

38:54.600 --> 38:56.600
7 tubes

38:56.600 --> 38:58.600
And each tube

38:58.600 --> 39:00.600
Will have 3

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
6-inch detector

39:02.600 --> 39:04.600
Array

39:04.600 --> 39:06.600
So

39:06.600 --> 39:08.600
The receiver

39:08.600 --> 39:10.600
Will have 21 detector array

39:10.600 --> 39:12.600
Compare to Act

39:12.600 --> 39:14.600
Act has 3, L has 21

39:14.600 --> 39:16.600
This

39:16.600 --> 39:18.600
Observatory

39:18.600 --> 39:20.600
Is a giant

39:20.600 --> 39:22.600
2.8m

39:22.600 --> 39:24.600
In length

39:24.600 --> 39:26.600
The whole

39:26.600 --> 39:28.600
Platform

39:28.600 --> 39:30.600
Has

39:30.600 --> 39:32.600
About 15m

39:32.600 --> 39:34.600
Height

39:34.600 --> 39:36.600
Another small aperture telescope

39:36.600 --> 39:38.600
We call it S-A-T

39:38.600 --> 39:40.600
Sensitive to L below 200

39:40.600 --> 39:42.600
Like

39:42.600 --> 39:44.600
Bicep

39:44.600 --> 39:46.600
Polar bear array

39:46.600 --> 39:48.600
Mainly

39:48.600 --> 39:50.600
Focusing on

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
Primordial BMO

39:52.600 --> 39:54.600
The mirror is

39:54.600 --> 39:56.600
0.5m

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
And

39:58.600 --> 40:00.600
Baseline is

40:00.600 --> 40:02.600
3 S-A-T

40:02.600 --> 40:04.600
Each S-A-T

40:04.600 --> 40:06.600
Can have 7 array

40:06.600 --> 40:08.600
So

40:08.600 --> 40:10.600
About 21

40:10.600 --> 40:12.600
Detector

40:12.600 --> 40:14.600
With funding

40:14.600 --> 40:16.600
4 S-A-T

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
28 detector

40:18.600 --> 40:20.600
So

40:22.600 --> 40:24.600
The total

40:24.600 --> 40:26.600
Detector count

40:26.600 --> 40:28.600
We have

40:28.600 --> 40:30.600
2 technologies

40:30.600 --> 40:32.600
And we will

40:32.600 --> 40:34.600
Deploy

40:34.600 --> 40:36.600
The first

40:36.600 --> 40:38.600
NIST

40:38.600 --> 40:40.600
NIST

40:40.600 --> 40:42.600
MF

40:42.600 --> 40:44.600
UHF

40:44.600 --> 40:46.600
And

40:46.600 --> 40:48.600
220 and 270 GHz

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
So

40:50.600 --> 40:52.600
NIST will focus on

40:52.600 --> 40:54.600
These two

40:54.600 --> 40:56.600
Detector type

40:56.600 --> 40:58.600
Another

40:58.600 --> 41:00.600
Berkeley

41:00.600 --> 41:02.600
They will

41:02.600 --> 41:04.600
Do another array

41:04.600 --> 41:06.600
Their

41:06.600 --> 41:08.600
Central frequency sensitive to

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
30 to 40 GHz

41:10.600 --> 41:12.600
This is another technology

41:12.600 --> 41:14.600
The same

41:14.600 --> 41:16.600
TS technology

41:16.600 --> 41:18.600
In total

41:18.600 --> 41:20.600
It will have

41:20.600 --> 41:22.600
60,000 TS

41:22.600 --> 41:24.600
Barometer

41:24.600 --> 41:26.600
When we deploy

41:26.600 --> 41:28.600
60,000 TS

41:28.600 --> 41:30.600
Barometer

41:30.600 --> 41:32.600
So

41:32.600 --> 41:34.600
Magnitude

41:34.600 --> 41:36.600
More than

41:36.600 --> 41:38.600
At

41:38.600 --> 41:40.600
So

41:40.600 --> 41:42.600
This is

41:42.600 --> 41:44.600
Summary

41:44.600 --> 41:46.600
Assignment of

41:46.600 --> 41:48.600
Plan

41:48.600 --> 41:50.600
Supposedly

41:50.600 --> 41:52.600
We want to deploy S-A-T

41:52.600 --> 41:54.600
Next year

41:54.600 --> 41:56.600
Sometime

41:56.600 --> 41:58.600
Then

41:58.600 --> 42:00.600
Then

42:00.600 --> 42:02.600
Deploy

42:02.600 --> 42:04.600
The rest

42:04.600 --> 42:06.600
S-A-T

42:06.600 --> 42:08.600
And

42:08.600 --> 42:10.600
Populate

42:10.600 --> 42:12.600
S-A-T optics

42:12.600 --> 42:14.600
So

42:14.600 --> 42:16.600
This is

42:16.600 --> 42:18.600
My role in assignment

42:18.600 --> 42:20.600
Mainly

42:20.600 --> 42:22.600
Scheduling

42:22.600 --> 42:24.600
Besides

42:24.600 --> 42:26.600
The detector and readout

42:26.600 --> 42:28.600
Plan

42:28.600 --> 42:30.600
So

42:30.600 --> 42:32.600
Today's talk

42:32.600 --> 42:34.600
Ends here

42:34.600 --> 42:36.600
Thank you

42:36.600 --> 42:38.600
Yama

42:40.600 --> 42:42.600
Any questions?

42:42.600 --> 42:44.600
Let's

42:44.600 --> 42:46.600
Turn on the mic

42:46.600 --> 42:48.600
So the speaker can hear

42:48.600 --> 42:50.600
Applause

42:50.600 --> 42:52.600
Thank you

42:52.600 --> 42:54.600
For the wonderful talk

42:54.600 --> 42:56.600
Then

42:56.600 --> 42:58.600
Before Q&A

42:58.600 --> 43:00.600
I want to say

43:00.600 --> 43:02.600
This is so cute

43:02.600 --> 43:04.600
There is no such cute logo in the lab

43:04.600 --> 43:06.600
And this

43:06.600 --> 43:08.600
OK

43:08.600 --> 43:10.600
Any questions?

43:12.600 --> 43:14.600
I have a question

43:14.600 --> 43:16.600
That

43:16.600 --> 43:18.600
The new array

43:18.600 --> 43:20.600
It is

43:20.600 --> 43:22.600
Work independently

43:22.600 --> 43:24.600
Interferometry

43:24.600 --> 43:26.600
It is

43:26.600 --> 43:28.600
Uh

43:28.600 --> 43:30.600
In

43:30.600 --> 43:32.600
Uh

43:32.600 --> 43:34.600
Uh

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
Our array does not work independently

43:36.600 --> 43:38.600
They are

43:38.600 --> 43:40.600
Scanned at the same time

43:40.600 --> 43:42.600
Yes

43:42.600 --> 43:44.600
Will you do

43:44.600 --> 43:46.600
Interferometry

43:46.600 --> 43:48.600
There are three telescopes

43:48.600 --> 43:50.600
Coordinate observation

43:50.600 --> 43:52.600
But

43:52.600 --> 43:54.600
They can cross-check

43:54.600 --> 43:56.600
We will cross-check

43:56.600 --> 43:58.600
You

43:58.600 --> 44:00.600
If they see the same sky

44:00.600 --> 44:02.600
Then

44:02.600 --> 44:04.600
We will cross-check

44:04.600 --> 44:06.600
Make sure

44:06.600 --> 44:08.600
No systematics

44:08.600 --> 44:10.600
We build

44:10.600 --> 44:12.600
So many small

44:12.600 --> 44:14.600
At the same time

44:14.600 --> 44:16.600
Not a bigger

44:16.600 --> 44:18.600
Or something

44:18.600 --> 44:20.600
You can

44:20.600 --> 44:22.600
Remove the systematics

44:22.600 --> 44:24.600
Which is really big

44:24.600 --> 44:26.600
Telescope

44:26.600 --> 44:28.600
So

44:28.600 --> 44:30.600
There is no way to make it

44:30.600 --> 44:32.600
Like a

44:32.600 --> 44:34.600
Baseline

44:34.600 --> 44:36.600
Baseline

44:36.600 --> 44:38.600
There should be two baselines

44:38.600 --> 44:40.600
At least you can

44:40.600 --> 44:42.600
I don't know if resolution is important to you

44:46.600 --> 44:48.600
I think you can use some techniques

44:48.600 --> 44:50.600
But I think

44:50.600 --> 44:52.600
Idea should be different from interferometry

44:52.600 --> 44:54.600
OK

44:54.600 --> 44:56.600
Every time

44:56.600 --> 44:58.600
What time scale

44:58.600 --> 45:00.600
Time

45:00.600 --> 45:02.600
Uh

45:02.600 --> 45:04.600
Every integration

45:04.600 --> 45:06.600
How long

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
Very fast

45:08.600 --> 45:10.600
I forgot

45:10.600 --> 45:12.600
Anyway, it's fast

45:12.600 --> 45:14.600
There may be no way to do this

45:14.600 --> 45:16.600
You

45:16.600 --> 45:18.600
You usually don't see time

45:18.600 --> 45:20.600
Interference

45:20.600 --> 45:22.600
There may be some interference

45:22.600 --> 45:24.600
OK

45:26.600 --> 45:28.600
Then

45:28.600 --> 45:30.600
This picture

45:30.600 --> 45:32.600
The reason why it's so far

45:32.600 --> 45:34.600
And every thing has a show

45:34.600 --> 45:36.600
Don't want to be affected by others

45:36.600 --> 45:38.600
Because

45:38.600 --> 45:40.600
If you hit this

45:40.600 --> 45:42.600
Then hit another panel

45:42.600 --> 45:44.600
Um

45:46.600 --> 45:48.600
Then I ask another question

45:48.600 --> 45:50.600
OK

45:50.600 --> 45:52.600
Is

45:52.600 --> 45:54.600
In the end

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
These things need

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
Because generally speaking

45:58.600 --> 46:00.600
In traditional astronomical observation

46:00.600 --> 46:02.600
You want better reflectivity

46:02.600 --> 46:04.600
Make the mirror bigger

46:04.600 --> 46:06.600
Then make the detector bigger

46:06.600 --> 46:08.600
There is a bigger field of view

46:08.600 --> 46:10.600
But I see you

46:10.600 --> 46:12.600
Still a few meters

46:12.600 --> 46:14.600
That is

46:14.600 --> 46:16.600
What is the reason

46:16.600 --> 46:18.600
Because now

46:18.600 --> 46:20.600
It's easy to do

46:20.600 --> 46:22.600
12 meters or even 20 meters

46:22.600 --> 46:24.600
There should be no problem

46:24.600 --> 46:26.600
That

46:26.600 --> 46:28.600
Detector size can't follow

46:28.600 --> 46:30.600
What is the reason

46:30.600 --> 46:32.600
Go up

46:32.600 --> 46:34.600
Bigger

46:34.600 --> 46:36.600
We are

46:36.600 --> 46:38.600
I want to be smaller

46:38.600 --> 46:40.600
But the area

46:40.600 --> 46:42.600
No, the area should be bigger

46:42.600 --> 46:44.600
Should not say detector

46:44.600 --> 46:46.600
The field of view is mainly

46:46.600 --> 46:48.600
The size of the focal plane

46:48.600 --> 46:50.600
The focal plane is the population

46:50.600 --> 46:52.600
You have a focal plane

46:52.600 --> 46:54.600
How many detectors are there

46:54.600 --> 46:56.600
Yes

46:56.600 --> 46:58.600
You should be talking about

46:58.600 --> 47:00.600
The bigger the focal plane

47:00.600 --> 47:02.600
How many inside

47:02.600 --> 47:04.600
The bigger you do

47:04.600 --> 47:06.600
The more detectors inside

47:06.600 --> 47:08.600
Increase the field of view

47:08.600 --> 47:10.600
But

47:10.600 --> 47:12.600
We are mainly limited by

47:12.600 --> 47:14.600
We just want to do this

47:14.600 --> 47:16.600
2.8 meters long

47:16.600 --> 47:18.600
Receiver

47:18.600 --> 47:20.600
It's already big

47:20.600 --> 47:22.600
Every stage is already big

47:22.600 --> 47:24.600
Because we have to cool down

47:24.600 --> 47:26.600
To 100 millikelvin

47:26.600 --> 47:28.600
Cryogenic technology is very strong

47:28.600 --> 47:30.600
Then you

47:30.600 --> 47:32.600
We need a lot of pulse tube

47:32.600 --> 47:34.600
And dilution fridge

47:36.600 --> 47:38.600
Our pump

47:38.600 --> 47:40.600
May need more

47:40.600 --> 47:42.600
And just imagine

47:42.600 --> 47:44.600
You this

47:44.600 --> 47:46.600
300k

47:46.600 --> 47:48.600
Window

47:48.600 --> 47:50.600
At first we thought

47:50.600 --> 47:52.600
Can we find such a big window

47:52.600 --> 47:54.600
Or every individual

47:54.600 --> 47:56.600
Optics tube

47:56.600 --> 47:58.600
Have your own shape

47:58.600 --> 48:00.600
That material

48:00.600 --> 48:02.600
It's hard to control

48:02.600 --> 48:04.600
Hard to go

48:04.600 --> 48:06.600
And every stage

48:06.600 --> 48:08.600
We have filters

48:08.600 --> 48:10.600
Define the low pass band

48:10.600 --> 48:12.600
That filter

48:12.600 --> 48:14.600
Size is also a problem

48:14.600 --> 48:16.600
I don't think

48:16.600 --> 48:18.600
We are not

48:18.600 --> 48:20.600
Current ground base

48:20.600 --> 48:22.600
The biggest mirror is SPT

48:22.600 --> 48:24.600
They did 10 meters

48:24.600 --> 48:26.600
Yes

48:26.600 --> 48:28.600
But consider

48:28.600 --> 48:30.600
All kinds of technology

48:30.600 --> 48:32.600
And efficiency

48:32.600 --> 48:34.600
The final decision is

48:34.600 --> 48:36.600
Choose 6 meters

48:36.600 --> 48:38.600
Then

48:42.600 --> 48:44.600
Any questions?

48:44.600 --> 48:46.600
I have two questions

48:46.600 --> 48:48.600
The first question is

48:48.600 --> 48:50.600
Your wafer

48:50.600 --> 48:52.600
Back short

48:52.600 --> 48:54.600
You said it's silicon

48:54.600 --> 48:56.600
Is it pure silicon?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.600
Or you have etched

48:58.600 --> 49:00.600
My question is

49:00.600 --> 49:02.600
Back short

49:02.600 --> 49:04.600
The top

49:04.600 --> 49:06.600
It's a flat surface

49:06.600 --> 49:08.600
It's a

49:08.600 --> 49:10.600
Pure silicon

49:10.600 --> 49:12.600
There is a

49:12.600 --> 49:14.600
Back short cavity

49:14.600 --> 49:16.600
You can see

49:16.600 --> 49:18.600
It's magnified

49:18.600 --> 49:20.600
It has a groove

49:20.600 --> 49:22.600
It has

49:22.600 --> 49:24.600
It has

49:24.600 --> 49:26.600
Feature

49:26.600 --> 49:28.600
It covers

49:28.600 --> 49:30.600
TS

49:30.600 --> 49:32.600
It won't see

49:32.600 --> 49:34.600
Light leak

49:34.600 --> 49:36.600
From other TS

49:36.600 --> 49:38.600
It covers TS

49:38.600 --> 49:40.600
It has

49:40.600 --> 49:42.600
Some design

49:42.600 --> 49:44.600
Determine

49:44.600 --> 49:46.600
We can

49:46.600 --> 49:48.600
Obtain all light

49:48.600 --> 49:50.600
But won't let TS

49:50.600 --> 49:52.600
Contaminated

49:52.600 --> 49:54.600
No cross talk

49:54.600 --> 49:56.600
I see

49:56.600 --> 49:58.600
It's like

49:58.600 --> 50:00.600
Blocking

50:00.600 --> 50:02.600
We'll

50:02.600 --> 50:04.600
Back it

50:04.600 --> 50:06.600
We'll use

50:06.600 --> 50:08.600
Sidecast

50:08.600 --> 50:10.600
Ok

50:10.600 --> 50:12.600
I see

50:12.600 --> 50:14.600
So

50:14.600 --> 50:16.600
It's purpose

50:16.600 --> 50:18.600
You're a barometer

50:18.600 --> 50:20.600
You want

50:20.600 --> 50:22.600
Reflection

50:22.600 --> 50:24.600
Collect energy

50:24.600 --> 50:26.600
Is it?

50:26.600 --> 50:28.600
Yes

50:28.600 --> 50:30.600
I see

50:30.600 --> 50:32.600
Ok

50:32.600 --> 50:34.600
I have another question

50:34.600 --> 50:36.600
I think

50:36.600 --> 50:38.600
We should wait

50:38.600 --> 50:40.600
So

50:40.600 --> 50:42.600
Any other questions?

50:42.600 --> 50:44.600
I have a question

50:44.600 --> 50:46.600
Please

50:46.600 --> 50:48.600
You

50:48.600 --> 50:50.600
Observe data for CMB

50:50.600 --> 50:52.600
And

50:52.600 --> 50:54.600
Other groups

50:54.600 --> 50:56.600
Do other science?

50:56.600 --> 50:58.600
Yes

50:58.600 --> 51:00.600
A big part

51:00.600 --> 51:02.600
Analysis people

51:02.600 --> 51:04.600
They do

51:04.600 --> 51:06.600
Secondary

51:06.600 --> 51:08.600
They often

51:08.600 --> 51:10.600
With DS

51:10.600 --> 51:12.600
Or

51:12.600 --> 51:14.600
LST

51:14.600 --> 51:16.600
Combine

51:16.600 --> 51:18.600
Act

51:18.600 --> 51:20.600
Some people

51:20.600 --> 51:22.600
With Subaru

51:22.600 --> 51:24.600
Many

51:24.600 --> 51:26.600
Collaboration

51:26.600 --> 51:28.600
Many useful data

51:28.600 --> 51:30.600
Can be applied

51:30.600 --> 51:32.600
Not only

51:32.600 --> 51:34.600
Pure CMB

51:34.600 --> 51:36.600
Act is doing well

51:36.600 --> 51:38.600
All data

51:38.600 --> 51:40.600
Released publicly

51:40.600 --> 51:42.600
Everyone can

51:42.600 --> 51:44.600
Reproduce

51:44.600 --> 51:46.600
And

51:46.600 --> 51:48.600
We welcome

51:48.600 --> 51:50.600
And SO

51:50.600 --> 51:52.600
To that direction

51:52.600 --> 51:54.600
But no data

51:56.600 --> 51:58.600
Do you want to collaborate?

52:02.600 --> 52:04.600
This skill is different from mine

52:08.600 --> 52:10.600
In a few years

52:12.600 --> 52:14.600
Ok

52:14.600 --> 52:16.600
Any other questions?

52:16.600 --> 52:18.600
Time is up

52:18.600 --> 52:20.600
Let's applaud

52:20.600 --> 52:22.600
Thank you

52:22.600 --> 52:24.600
For your wonderful speech

52:26.600 --> 52:28.600
That's all

52:28.600 --> 52:30.600
Thank you
