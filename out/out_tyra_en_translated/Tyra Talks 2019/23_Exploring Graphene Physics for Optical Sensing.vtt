00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello everyone, welcome to the 7th of March, this week's Tara Talk.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
We are very honored to invite Dr. Jason Hong to tell us about his research.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
The topic he is going to talk about today is Exploring Graphic Physics for Optical Sensing.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
He said that this is his work when he was studying for his doctorate degree at UC Berkeley.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Let me introduce Dr. Jason Hong.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
He graduated from the Department of Physics in Taiwan.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
He later studied for his doctorate degree at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
After his doctorate degree, he is now working as a doctor in Michigan.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
His field of expertise is super-fast light in physical and physical applications.

00:43.000 --> 00:58.000
His main field of expertise is optical sensing, two-dimensional semiconductor exciton and cavity exciton polariton.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
He is going to talk about his work in his doctorate degree, Graphic Optical Sensing.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
We are going to give him a round of applause.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
But we need to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear our applause.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Let's welcome Dr. Jason Hong to give us a speech.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
I am going to focus on optical sensing in graphic physics.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
I won't talk too much about super-fast light.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
If you want to know more about super-fast light, you can go to my previous talk at TerraTalk.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Hello, everyone. I am Jason Hong.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
This is today's outline.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
First of all, I am going to talk about motivation.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
I am going to tell you why we need to use graphene or, more broadly, two-dimensional materials to make optical sensors.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
What are the advantages of using them?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
What are the side effects of using them?

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
I am going to give you two examples of what I am doing.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
One is to use graphene to observe electrochemistry.

02:19.000 --> 02:33.000
Electrochemistry is the chemical reaction that occurs between a solid state and a liquid state.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
We can use graphene as an optical sensor to observe these electrochemistry reactions.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
This is because we developed a method called Diffrational Vibrational Spectroscopy.

02:50.000 --> 03:00.000
We can see the signals of the small molecules on the graphene.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
Another example is that we want to observe neurotransmitters on graphene.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Neurotransmitters produce electrical signals.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
These electrical signals are the methods of transmitting information in our brain.

03:18.000 --> 03:28.000
We put neurotransmitters on graphene and use graphene to observe these neurotransmitters.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
This is because we developed a method called Waveguide-Based Imaging.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
We will introduce this method in detail later.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Let's start with Motivation.

03:41.000 --> 03:50.000
Before talking about Motivation, let's learn about what is a two-dimensional material.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Can you see the figure on the left?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Can you see my mouse?

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
Yes, I can see it.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
This is graphite.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
The structure of graphite is a layer of carbon atoms.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
When a layer of graphite is separated, it is called graphene.

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
When a layer of graphite is rolled up, it is called carbon nanotube.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
When a layer of graphite is rolled up, it is called fullerene.

04:40.000 --> 04:58.000
Historically, we first discovered the structure of carbon nanotube.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
We have never discovered the structure of graphene.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Of course, we know that graphene exists in the structure of graphite.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
But we have never seen the existence of graphene alone.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
What is the reason?

05:14.000 --> 05:27.000
In order to calculate the properties of graphene, nanotube, and fullerene,

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
the theorists already know the properties of graphene.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
The properties of electricity and light are already known.

05:41.000 --> 05:53.000
Before the discovery of graphene, there was a theory.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
When the two materials of graphene exist separately, they are thermodynamically unstable.

06:02.000 --> 06:14.000
The thermodynamic effect causes ripples on the surface of the two materials.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
In the end, the two materials will stick together and become a bunch of wrinkles.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
Therefore, the previous theorists thought that the two materials alone could not exist.

06:27.000 --> 06:37.000
In 2004, the two Nobel Prize winners, Andrew Gamm and Novoselov,

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
discovered that they could use a very simple method.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
They put graphene on a tape and peeled it off layer by layer.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Finally, they put it on the silicon wafer.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
They observed that a single layer of graphene could exist.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
The main reason is that it is not an isolated 2D material.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
It also has some ripples.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
But because there is a substrate underneath,

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
you can put the two materials on the substrate to make them exist in the world.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
At that time, many people were trying similar things.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
There are many strange methods.

07:32.000 --> 07:41.000
In the end, they found that the most effective way was to use tape.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
In fact, there are many interesting stories.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
We can share them later.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
After the discovery of graphene,

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
we know that the two-dimensional material can exist alone on the substrate.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Later, a series of two-dimensional materials were developed.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
Today, we focus on two-dimensional materials related to light.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
In fact, there are many different materials,

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
such as two-dimensional superconductors or two-dimensional magnetic materials.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
For light, the most important thing is the bandgap of this material.

08:28.000 --> 08:38.000
You can see that there is no bandgap between graphene and molybdenum and molybdenum disulfide.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Graphene is a semi-metal,

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
and there is basically no bandgap.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
Molybdenum and molybdenum disulfide are two-dimensional superconductors,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
and there is a bandgap.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Graphene is an insulator,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
and there is a very large bandgap.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
We have all kinds of two-dimensional materials,

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
which can cover the entire spectrum of light.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
In fact, in each spectrum,

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
in each region from microwave to visible,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
people use two-dimensional materials to do something.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
The interesting thing is that two-dimensional materials give you a lot of new degrees of freedom.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
For example, you can change the number of layers,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
you can change the doping of electrons in the two-dimensional material,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
and usually the two-dimensional material is a hexagonal structure,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
so it has two different values.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
There are two minima on the bandstructure.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
And these two-dimensional materials are very easy to integrate.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
What we can do now is that

09:57.000 --> 10:07.000
we can use some methods to pick up these two-dimensional materials,

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
and then we can stack them layer by layer to the place we want.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
The important thing is that

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
you have to match the lattice.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
For example, in the past, the structure was used to grow.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
The way to grow is to make sure that

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
the lattice of the base and the thing you want to grow is the same.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
Otherwise, you will have a lot of strain.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
It will lead to a lot of constraints for these devices.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But the two-dimensional material does not have this problem.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
You can put it wherever you want.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
So we can do a lot of things that we couldn't do before.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
These two-dimensional materials have a very strong effect on light.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
We will see these effects later.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
When you have this two-dimensional material toolbox,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
and there are so many new degrees of freedom,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
we can do a lot of different things.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
For example, someone is studying how to use two-dimensional materials to make photodetectors and modulators.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
There are LEDs and lasers for light.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
There are also people doing nonlinear optics or single photon emission.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
In short, I think this field is quite developed.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
And there are a lot of new ideas that need to be tried.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
And none of them have been tried.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
So we don't know what will happen.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Why do I choose graphene as a light sensor?

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
What are the advantages of graphene sensors?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
From the perspective of two-dimensional materials,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
the first is that it has very good sensitivity.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
The second advantage is that because it is a two-dimensional material,

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
we can easily change its electron doping.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
From the perspective of optics,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
when you want to make a sensor,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
you need to pay attention to the light.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
If you use light to detect or compare to other methods,

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
such as electromagnetic or other hardware,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
the advantage of light is that it is non-invasive.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
And you can penetrate the lower part.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
So when the light hits your sample,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
you will not cause damage to the sample.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
And the more interesting thing is that light can do spectroscopy.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
So you can get a lot of extra information.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And it can do imaging.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Sometimes it's what you really want.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
For example, we want to do the structure of neural cells.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
How do we imagine it?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
This is a very important thing.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Sorry, can I interrupt you?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
No problem.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
OK, I want to ask.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Because we are also doing 2D material.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
You said that it is easy to do doping on 2D.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
But I want to know your strategy.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Because we encountered a big problem.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
In fact, we found that it was not so simple.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Or doping is actually unstable.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
The doping I'm talking about here is mainly electrical doping.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
We add an electrode.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
Then inject the electron directly with the method of electrolysis.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's actually gate control.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Yes, it's gate control.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
OK, so I misunderstood.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
OK, thank you.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
I think you want to talk about chemical doping.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Similar.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
It should be called twin Fermi level.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Later, when I talk about examples.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
You will see how we tune the Fermi level.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I think this degree of freedom is very important.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And it's a new degree of freedom.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
So I think it's quite useful.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
Graphene is the first two-dimensional material to be discovered.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It is a one-layer atomic layer.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
Everyone says it has very good electrical, optical, chemical and mechanical properties.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Electrical has very high mobility.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Optical has a very strong light response.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Interestingly, a single layer of graphene can absorb 2% of light.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
This is actually quite interesting.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
You can imagine that a single layer of atomic layer can absorb 2% of light.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Another interesting thing is that you can directly see graphene with the naked eye.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
This is also something that people may not have thought of before 2004.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Chemical properties.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
Graphene is actually a structure of many hexagonal carbons.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
So it has a very strong pi-pi reaction.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
Many people use this pi-pi reaction to functionalize graphene.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Then you can do different things.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Mechanically, graphene has a very strong elasticity.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So it is very flexible.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
I think the most important thing is that graphene is a single atomic layer.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
So all the material is on its surface.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
This material is very sensitive to its environment.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
If there is a little movement outside, graphene will react.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
I think this is the most important thing for the optical sensor.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I have a question.

16:39.000 --> 16:47.000
Is there a selection rule for the interaction between graphene and light?

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
What is the interaction between graphene and light?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Is its mechanism a dipole?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Yes, it is a dipole.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Graphene is a Dirac cone structure.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
You can imagine that it is a band-to-band interaction.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
From the bottom valence band to the top conduction band.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Because the bottom is filled with electrons and the top is empty.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
So this transition is allowed.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
That transition is the 2% assumption I mentioned.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
There are also intra-band transitions.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
There is also acetone in higher energy.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
This is the band structure of graphene.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Brinois zone is hexagonal.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
There are Dirac cones at the edge of the Brinois zone.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
Its energy and momentum dispersion are linear.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
General semiconductors are parabolic.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
If you calculate like this, the density of state is also linear.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
You can see that the density of state is equal to the Fermi energy.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
When the Fermi energy is zero, the density of state is very small.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
What does it mean?

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
When there is some external influence,

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
which causes some doping in the graphene,

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
the Fermi energy will move very fast.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.000
If it moves fast, it means that it is easy to change the optical transition.

19:02.000 --> 19:14.000
This causes that the external influence of graphene is very large.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
One of the effects is that the electrical energy is also very large.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
What I show here is a field effect device.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Basically, graphene is on silicon dioxide.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Silicon dioxide is an insulator.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Silicon is a conductor.

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
Graphene and silicon form an electrolyte.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
When you add a voltage, the graphene will be electrically doped.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
The electrons will go to the graphene.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Or you can extract the electrons in the graphene.

19:55.000 --> 20:03.000
The graph on the right shows that when you change the gate voltage,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
that is, when you change the number of electrons in the graphene,

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
its resistance will increase and decrease.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
This is a very important phenomenon of graphene.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
The external voltage can change the resistance of graphene.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
The change is very drastic.

20:26.000 --> 20:36.000
Many people use this principle to make graphene's electrical sensor.

20:37.000 --> 20:47.000
Another advantage of graphene is that it is flexible.

20:47.000 --> 20:58.000
This means that it can be compatible with biological materials.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
It can make all kinds of flexible devices.

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
It can also do chemical binding.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
For example, you can add DNA or protein to it.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
In this way, you will have some chemical selectivity.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
Next, I will talk about two examples I made.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Let's start with the first example.

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
The first example is to use graphene to look at the chemistry near the electrode.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Do you have any other questions before I talk about it?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Okay, no.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Then I will continue.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
There is a very important problem.

21:56.000 --> 22:04.000
In fact, we often use graphene as an electrode in our daily life.

22:04.000 --> 22:13.000
For example, your home's carbonate battery is also used as an electrode.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
You know that the battery has to produce chemical reactions.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
These chemical reactions are actually produced on these deliberate cross-sections.

22:23.000 --> 22:32.000
How to understand these chemical processes is a very important thing.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
We developed a method.

22:35.000 --> 22:47.000
We use IR light to detect the molecules near the graphene.

22:47.000 --> 23:01.000
This is the main mechanism of IR infrared vibrational spectroscopy.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
These molecules have different vibration modes.

23:05.000 --> 23:17.000
These vibration modes have different frequency.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
When you put a IR light on these molecules,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
it will excite these vibrations.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Then the IR light will be absorbed.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
Because the IR light will only be absorbed at that frequency,

23:34.000 --> 23:41.000
you can see what kind of vibration structure these molecules have.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Of course, different molecules also have different vibration structures.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
So you can tell which molecule you are hitting now.

23:48.000 --> 23:57.000
In fact, you can know the arrangement and appearance of these molecules in more detail.

23:57.000 --> 24:11.000
For example, you can see that EXO's spectrum is light energy.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
This is about three microns of light.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
These peaks represent several different vibration modes.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
There is a problem.

24:26.000 --> 24:38.000
Because the chemical reactions on the surface are very rare.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Very few molecules are involved in the reaction.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Because usually only one or two layers are enough.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
How to see this one or two-layer molecule structure is a big problem.

24:48.000 --> 24:56.000
In general, the absorption of one-layer molecules is about 10 to the power of 3 to 10 to the power of 4.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
You have to spend a lot of time to integrate the signal to see it.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
We developed a method called diffractional spectroscopy.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
In general, people do IR spectroscopy.

25:13.000 --> 25:20.000
When you hit the light of the IR, you can see its reflection.

25:20.000 --> 25:30.000
At this time, the electric field can be imagined as the electric field from the substrate.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
The electric field from the substrate and the electric field from the molecule are quite close.

25:36.000 --> 25:50.000
The difference in intensity is the electric field square.

25:50.000 --> 26:03.000
When you expand this, you will find that it is two times one from the molecule divided by one from the substrate.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
This is about 0.2%, which is about 10 to the power of 4.

26:09.000 --> 26:22.000
The method we use is to make graphene into a periodic grating shape.

26:22.000 --> 26:33.000
Only on the surface of the graphene will there be these molecules.

26:33.000 --> 26:40.000
You can imagine that these things are grating, so they will produce one-layer reflection or two-layer reflection.

26:40.000 --> 26:47.000
Of course, we only look at one-layer reflection.

26:47.000 --> 26:55.000
Because the interface between the substrate and the solution is actually non-periodic,

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
it does not participate in the diffraction.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
Only graphene and these molecules can participate in the diffraction.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
At this time, the electric field from the substrate and the electric field from the molecule are close.

27:11.000 --> 27:30.000
As mentioned earlier, the absorption of graphene is about 2%, which means that its electric field is about 1%.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
The electric field from the substrate is about 10 to the power of 3.

27:34.000 --> 27:43.000
When you do the calculation like this, you will find that it is the electric field from the molecule and the electric field from the graphene.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
This thing is obviously much bigger, and now it becomes 20%.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
In theory, it can suddenly increase the sensitivity by 100 times.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
This thing is likely to allow you to detect single-layer molecules.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Can I ask a question?

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Does the original reflection affect the mechanism just now?

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Will it affect the signal that you finally gradient?

28:20.000 --> 28:28.000
The original reflection will be at the angle of the reflection.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
But at this time, we can choose to only look at the angle of the diffraction.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Oh, I see.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Then we look at this angle and there will be a very strong signal.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Thank you.

28:43.000 --> 28:49.000
Then we make the graphene into the shape of the grating.

28:49.000 --> 29:01.000
On the other side of the graphene, there is a platinum electrode with a voltage.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
This is basically a battery structure.

29:05.000 --> 29:14.000
When the light hits it, of course you will have a reflected signal.

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
But there will also be a diffraction signal from the periodic structure of the graphene.

29:20.000 --> 29:29.000
We can basically use the method of light to select that we only need to look at the diffraction.

29:30.000 --> 29:39.000
Basically, what we see is the intensity of the diffraction.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
You don't have to look at the red line first, just look at the black line.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
The dots are experimental.

29:52.000 --> 30:00.000
You can see that the charge control point is basically the graphene at Fermi energy equals zero.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
There will be some diffraction.

30:03.000 --> 30:12.000
When you increase the electron in the graphene, the intensity of the diffraction will decrease.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
When you add more, it will increase again.

30:16.000 --> 30:28.000
The first thing we need to understand is how the diffraction occurs in the graphene.

30:28.000 --> 30:36.000
We can understand that there are two kinds of transitions in the graphene.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
One is the interband transition.

30:38.000 --> 30:46.000
The graphene balance band is full of electrons.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
The graphene conduction band has no electrons.

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
When the light comes in, it can go from an electron state to a state without electrons.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
This is the transition allowed.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
The light will be 2% absorption.

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
When you change your Fermi energy,

31:12.000 --> 31:21.000
For example, the low-energy light has some electrons in its conduction band.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
These electrons can't go up.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
This transition is called forbidden.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
It can't produce this transition.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
These lights will be transmitted.

31:32.000 --> 31:43.000
Basically, we can see that when the light is 2EF,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
there will be an onset.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
It can be absorbed above 2EF.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
It can't be absorbed below 2EF.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
When you change the Fermi energy,

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
the onset will be changed.

32:03.000 --> 32:18.000
Another kind of absorption is called free carrier response.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
It is called the interband transition.

32:23.000 --> 32:32.000
The graphene electrons jump from the balance band to the balance band.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
This is not possible in light theory.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
Light has a very small momentum.

32:40.000 --> 32:52.000
This is the scattering caused by the phonon or defect in the graphene.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
When the free carrier increases,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
when the doping increases,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
it also increases.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
Doping is a Drude behavior.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
It is a Lorentzian type of behavior.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
When you add these two things together,

33:15.000 --> 33:21.000
you will find that we can calculate the optical conductivity of graphene.

33:21.000 --> 33:28.000
The optical conductivity is basically equal to the diffraction intensity.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
You can see the graph on the right.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
For example, let's look at 0.13EV.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
When the Fermi energy is 130mEV,

33:43.000 --> 33:51.000
on the right is the interband transition.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
There are some absorption here.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
There is an onset here.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
This is 2EF.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
The area of 3000 is 2EF.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
The upper part is the interband transition.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The lower part is blocked.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
The bulging part is the interband transition.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
When the EF increases,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
the interband transition increases.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
The onset of the interband transition is shifted to the right.

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
Our experiment is done at about 3000EV,

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
which is about 3.3uEV.

34:32.000 --> 34:39.000
You can see that when the Fermi energy is very small,

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
it is mainly an interband transition.

34:42.000 --> 34:49.000
This causes a large diffraction intensity at the CMP.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
However, when the doping occurs,

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
the interband transition is gradually blocked.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
The intensity starts to drop,

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
which is about 0.8 to 0.4.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
Finally, when you continue to increase the doping,

35:10.000 --> 35:16.000
the interband transition will start to participate in the absorption.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
You will see a strong diffraction intensity.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
We can understand the diffraction of graphene in this way.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
Next, we will do a demonstration.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
We put a molecule called Ctab.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
It is a long-chain structure.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
These long-chain structures like to run on the electrode of graphene.

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
We use IR spectroscopy to look at these Ctab molecules.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
They are on the channel of diffraction.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
We see that the spectrum is similar to this.

36:16.000 --> 36:23.000
Basically, the diffraction is the interference of the electric field of graphene

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
and the electric field of the molecule.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
The diffraction intensity you see is also like this.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
It has a background.

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
This background is from graphene, which is about 0.85.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
In addition, these peaks are from these molecules.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
There are many CH2 and CH3 in this long-chain molecule.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
We can compare these with the database.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
We can know which vibration mode each peak represents.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
For example, this peak may be symmetric CH2.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
This peak may be anti-symmetric CH2.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
This peak may be CH3 vibration.

37:10.000 --> 37:19.000
This spectrum is taken in 0.1 seconds.

37:19.000 --> 37:29.000
We can compare the contrast with the detection you do directly with reflection.

37:29.000 --> 37:35.000
The contrast has increased by 50 times, which is about 100 times as we expected.

37:35.000 --> 37:46.000
The density of this molecule is actually only 0.16 monolayer.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
It is actually a very small density in graphene.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
We can already see it.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
This means that this method can enhance our sensitivity.

37:57.000 --> 38:05.000
We can see 0.16 monolayer changes in 0.1 seconds.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
Excuse me, can I ask?

38:08.000 --> 38:18.000
Is the size of this molecule and the size of this graphene similar to what you show on the picture?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Or is it not different at all?

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
The size of the molecule?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
What do you mean?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Do you mean the picture on the left?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Yes.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
This picture is a memory map.

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
So the CTAP is much smaller than the graphene.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
I'm just a little curious.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
So what is the width of the graphene?

38:51.000 --> 38:56.000
Because I didn't see it when you showed the picture.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
I forgot.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
It should be around 1 to 2 microns.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
Because you can imagine that our light goes in three microns.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
So if you want to separate the first order and the first order, it's probably in that order.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
I see. Thank you.

39:24.000 --> 39:34.000
Next, we will demonstrate that we can directly observe the chemical reaction on the graphene.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And it's timely.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
Because we can see 0.16 monolayers in 0.1 seconds.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
So you can actually see these reactions very quickly.

39:45.000 --> 39:56.000
Basically, CTAP and graphene will produce a reaction when your gating is large enough.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
They will produce a reaction like this.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
CTAP will throw an electron and produce these reactions.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
You can see the picture we just showed before the reaction.

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
After the reaction, the spectrum has changed.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
And the first thing is that the background has changed.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
The background means that the graphene was originally 0.85.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
The intensity is about 0.85.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Now it's more than 2.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
This means that the graphene has been doped.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
And the Fermi energy of the graphene has changed.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
So the intensity of the background has changed.

40:36.000 --> 40:46.000
Another thing you can see is that you can see the anti-symmetric CH2 and CH3.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
The anti-symmetric CH2 is still there.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
But the CH3 peak is significantly redshifted.

40:55.000 --> 41:01.000
This means that when these molecules are on the graphene,

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
Because the packing is tight, the vibration of CH3 is redshifted.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
This means that the chemical reaction has occurred.

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
So we can see these small spectrum changes.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
This is a demonstration.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
We can observe these chemical reactions near the graphene in an in-situ way.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
We can use the diffraction method.

41:29.000 --> 41:39.000
In this experiment, we developed the diffraction spectroscopy method.

41:39.000 --> 41:46.000
This method can improve the detection sensitivity and surface specificity.

41:46.000 --> 41:59.000
We think that this method can be applied to electrolyte and electrode.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
Because it is very easy to make the shape of the graphene into a grating.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
So I think this is a very general method.

42:08.000 --> 42:22.000
I think it can be used as a reference for those who do chemical engineering.

42:22.000 --> 42:28.000
Next, I will talk about how to use graphene for biosensing.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
The main thing we need to measure is bioelectricity.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
It is the electrical signal of nerve cells or heart cells.

42:35.000 --> 42:43.000
The electrical signal of nerve cells is a very hot topic.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
Although it has been a long time, people do not know much about it.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
We know how a single nerve cell transmits electrical signals.

42:54.000 --> 43:03.000
But we do not know what the electrical signals mean on a network of nerve cells.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
What does it mean that I am happy or sad?

43:08.000 --> 43:16.000
How is the information stored and processed in the human brain?

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
This is actually a very interesting question.

43:22.000 --> 43:30.000
But we do not have good tools to study this issue.

43:30.000 --> 43:38.000
Currently, there are two ways to detect the action potential on the market.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
The action potential is actually the electrical signal of these nerves.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
One method is the multi-electrode array.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
There are many small electrodes.

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
When the nerve cells are placed on the electrode,

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
the electrodes detect the electrical signals.

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
The other method is the voltage-sensitive array.

44:03.000 --> 44:10.000
The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.

44:10.000 --> 44:21.000
The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.

44:21.000 --> 44:28.000
The voltage-sensitive array detects the electrical signals of the nerve cells.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
But two things are important.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
The first thing is that we do not want the nerve cells to have labels.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
It is very troublesome to label the nerve cells one by one.

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
The advantage of the multi-electrode array is that it does not need to label.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
But the trouble is that it is not parallel.

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
Parallel means that you have to connect a line to each electrode.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
Then use an amplifier to enhance the electrical signal.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
So you have to use an amplifier for each electrode.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
This is very difficult and expensive.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
The advantage of the multi-sensitive array is that it is very parallel.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
Because you use light to detect the signal.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
So you just take a camera and keep taking pictures.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
This thing is very easy.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
But the other thing is that you have to display each cell.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
So you need to label the cell.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
When you label, you will have a lot of problems.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
Some voltage-sensitive arrays are toxic.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
It will cause the nerve cells not to respond.

45:41.000 --> 45:46.000
Some are said to cause abnormalities in the nerve cells.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Even though it is emitting a signal,

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
If it is an abnormal cell,

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
There is no point in studying it.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
Labeling causes the reaction of the nerve cells to be different.

46:01.000 --> 46:09.000
So we want to find a method that is both label-free and parallel.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
The detection scheme we want is

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
Sensitivity is about 200 microvolts.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Spatial resolution is about 10 microns.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
10 microns is the size of a nerve cell.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
We want to have real-time detection.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
The duration is about 1 millisecond.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
We are a optical detector.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
So we want to have total internal reflection.

46:42.000 --> 46:49.000
Because we want to remove the scattering of nerve cells.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
Then we start to consider.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
The first thing to consider is whether your signal-to-noise is enough.

46:56.000 --> 47:03.000
Can graphene detect electrical signals from nerve cells?

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
If we use the general method of transmission.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
When you shine a light,

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
You can imagine that the electrode is a nerve cell.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
When you add an electrical signal to the electrode,

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
Will the absorption of graphene be changed?

47:22.000 --> 47:31.000
We can estimate that the change is about 10 to the power of 4 to 10 to the power of 5.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
If we want to do this detection,

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
The detection limit is 2 millivolts.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
This is actually a very bad sensitivity.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
Because the electrical signals that nerve cells can generate

47:47.000 --> 47:53.000
It's usually between tens of microvolts to hundreds of microvolts.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
This is actually very, very bad.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
So our question is whether we can increase the modulation depth.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
The method we use is to put graphene on a planar waveguide.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
In this picture,

48:13.000 --> 48:20.000
Basically, this tantalum pentoxide has a relatively high refractive index.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
It is our planar waveguide.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
The light will spread inside.

48:24.000 --> 48:32.000
The graphene is placed on the planar waveguide.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
When the light passes through the graphene,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
The light will be absorbed.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
The absorption of light will be changed.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
The graphene will be changed by the electrical signal.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
The absorption of light will be changed.

48:48.000 --> 48:56.000
The silicon dioxide layer and solution have a relatively low refractive index.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
The light inside is evanescent.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
So it will be confined to the planar waveguide.

49:04.000 --> 49:10.000
One of the concepts we use is called critical coupling.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
Basically, it looks like this.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
We put graphene on the planar waveguide.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
You can imagine that when the light comes in,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
Because this is an evanescent wave,

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
The coupling of R1 will go into the waveguide.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
When it reflects back,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Some light will be absorbed by the graphene.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
So we write it as 1-α.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
α is the absorption of graphene.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
So its reflection is R2.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
It is 1 minus the absorption of graphene.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
When you consider these multiple interferences,

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
Basically, you can write the electric field in this form.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
It is the square root of R1-R2 divided by the square root of R1-R2.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
If you are doing photonics,

50:05.000 --> 50:11.000
You will find that this is exactly the same as the ring resonator.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
Basically, you have a beam of light coming in.

50:16.000 --> 50:22.000
The ring resonator has a coefficient of T1 that will go into the waveguide.

50:22.000 --> 50:28.000
Here, we have a coefficient of R1 that will go into the waveguide.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
Here, we have a coefficient of R1 that will go into the waveguide.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
It goes through an α-absorption.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Here is also an α-absorption.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
It goes back to the ring resonator.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
If you are familiar with the ring resonator,

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
You will know that this thing has a critical coupling.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
The meaning of critical coupling is

50:51.000 --> 51:01.000
Because the R-absorption of the waveguide can be changed,

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
We set R1 to a constant and change R2.

51:06.000 --> 51:13.000
When R1 is a constant, we set it to 0.95.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
When R2 is small, R1 is about 1.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
You can put a value in and you will know.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
When R2 is 1, the reflection is also 1.

51:24.000 --> 51:33.000
When R2 is a small or large value, the reflection is large and the absorption is small.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
But when R2 is equal to R1,

51:38.000 --> 51:44.000
There is a place in the middle where the reflection is 0 and the absorption is 1.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
The picture looks like this.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
If we can change R2,

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
When R1 is small, the reflectance is large.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
When R2 is large, the reflectance is also large.

51:57.000 --> 52:03.000
But there is a place in the middle where the absorption is very large and it can reach 100%.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
This is what we call critical coupling.

52:09.000 --> 52:17.000
Because R2 is the absorption of graphene,

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
We can use dopamine to change the alpha.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
Let R2 be equal to R1, then we have the largest absorption.

52:27.000 --> 52:40.000
This is what the reflectance looks like.

52:40.000 --> 52:49.000
Basically, if we put a neurotransmitter in, the Fermi energy will change slightly.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
We will see that the reflectivity will also change slightly.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
The concept is like this.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
This is our optical setup.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
Basically, we use a prism to couple into the waveguide.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Our light comes in like this.

53:18.000 --> 53:28.000
Basically, we look at the reflection of graphene and put it directly into an imaging system or a photodetector.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
This is an experiment.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
Basically, we do this.

53:41.000 --> 53:51.000
The first thing we do is to use an external voltage to change the Fermi energy of graphene.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
When you change the Fermi energy of graphene, the absorption of graphene will change.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
Its relative reflectivity will also change.

53:59.000 --> 54:07.000
You can see that when the Fermi energy is small, the absorption of graphene is large.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
Basically, it will not be coupled in.

54:12.000 --> 54:21.000
When the Fermi energy of graphene is large, the absorption will be small.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
It will not be coupled in, and the reflection will be large.

54:24.000 --> 54:33.000
Only when the absorption of graphene is just right, when R1 is equal to R2, there will be critical coupling.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
The reflectivity of this place will be small, and the absorption will be large.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
This is the place where the sensitivity is the largest.

54:43.000 --> 54:48.000
We put the neurotransmitter in this place.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
We put the external voltage field in this place.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
When the neurotransmitter comes in, a light signal will come out.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
We do this.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
There is a DC value of 0.5.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
We add an AC signal on it.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
We can directly see the change in the reflectivity of graphene.

55:12.000 --> 55:25.000
According to our test, we can see that if we give a millivolt AC voltage,

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
the change in reflectivity is about 10 to the power of 2.

55:30.000 --> 55:37.000
Compared with the previous transmission method, it has improved by about 100 to 200 times.

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
We can see a change of about 15 microvolts.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
We can directly see the action potential.

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
This is an imaging demonstration.

55:54.000 --> 56:01.000
We can not only see the voltage change at a single point,

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
but also see the voltage change in the whole region, and it is timely.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
Finally, we do a bio-test.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
We put a heart cell directly on graphene.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
We can see the electrical signals.

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
The interesting signals are from the heart.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
Heart cells can move.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
There are electrical signals and mechanical signals.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.000
We use a chemical called burblast.

56:40.000 --> 56:48.000
This chemical will make the heartbeat disappear.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
There will be no more mechanical beating.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
We can directly see the electrical signals.

56:55.000 --> 57:04.000
This is a biological demonstration.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
Can you go back to the previous page?

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
This page?

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
Your sharp peak is the electrical signal.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
The first one is parallel, the third one is parallel, and the fourth one is crooked.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
This cannot be directly compared.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
Before we add this chemical,

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
the heartbeat beats very regularly.

57:39.000 --> 57:45.000
It beats once every two seconds.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
However, when you add this chemical,

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
the heart cells die slowly.

57:52.000 --> 57:58.000
When we add this chemical, the heart cells die slowly.

58:05.000 --> 58:15.000
Finally, we use a camera to see the electrical signals.

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
We can see the electrical signals in the brighter area.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
There is no electrical signal at the beginning.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
The electrical signal comes from the left side of the screen.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
It enters the middle and goes to the right side.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
It goes beyond the detection range.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
Each frame is about 5 milliseconds.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
This is very timely.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
The frame size is about 1 millimeter.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
It is very accurate.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
We demonstrate this method.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
We can see the electrical signals in one frame.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
We can see the electrical signals in one frame.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
In conclusion,

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
we use the properties of graphene.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
First, it is very sensitive to the environment.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
Second, it can do doping.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
Doping can change the optical transition of graphene.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
We develop optical sensors.

59:18.000 --> 59:27.000
The first sensor is the chemical reaction near the graphene electrode.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
The second sensor is the electrical signal in the graphene.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
If we put nerve cells or heart cells on the graphene,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
we hope to see the electrical signals.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
This is our main work.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
This is the end of my speech.

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
These are my collaborators.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
The first one is my boss.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
These are PhD students or postdocs I have worked with.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
These are other teachers.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Thank you.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Let's applaud Jason for his speech.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Do you have any questions?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Can I ask you a question?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Sure.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Can you go back to the first two PowerPoint slides?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
In this setup,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
you have a prism with light coming in.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It interacts with the surface of the graphene.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000
This setup is often used to generate local plasmonic fields.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Do you consider this?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Or is it something you will look at in the future?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:04.000
The structure looks like local plasmonic.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
But the concept is completely different.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
There is no metal here.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It's all dielectric.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Our focus is on this.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
We can control the thickness of the evanescent wave.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Our focus is on controlling the thickness

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000
to change the light coupling coefficient.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
When you adjust the coefficient to the same as graphene,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
you can design it to be the same as graphene.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
This is when the critical coupling occurs.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
The assumption is 100%.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
So the sensitivity is theoretically infinite.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
If all the light is absorbed,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
a little change will cause a change from 0 to a certain intensity.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
This is theoretically an infinite sensitivity.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:14.000
This concept is the most important part of this device.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I see.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000
We think this is a better way than plasma.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
We are thinking about using this method to replace plasma.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Many people are using plasma enhanced biosensors.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Their claim is that they don't need labels.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
They can do the same thing.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
But I don't know if their sensitivity is as good as the claim.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
The main problem with plasma is that it can't be imaged.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
We can image this.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
This is correct.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
The sensitivity we are looking at is similar to plasma.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Our system is not yet fully optimized.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
0.5% of the light is still not absorbed.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
If you want to optimize this process,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
what do you need to change?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Do you need to change the quality of the substrate?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Or do you need to make it more optimized?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So far, the only thing that hasn't been absorbed is graphene scattering.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Do you mean graphene vibration scattering?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Or other photonic scattering?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
No, graphene is not homogeneous.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It's not homogeneous in space.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Oh, so there's still a bit of revo on it.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I see, I see.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So if I have a completely flat graphene,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
in theory, I can get 100% of it.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
If you can get the same amount of graphene in every place,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
then it should be very good.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Okay, I see.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
But the graphene we use here is actually all CVD.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
It's in the palm of your hand.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
When it's in the palm of your hand, it's in pieces.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
There are still some gaps in the middle.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I see.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So if you use a single crystal graphene,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
for example, when you turn the CVD,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
you don't want it to grow very big.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
If you use a very small graphene,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
will you get a very good result?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
You just collect a very small signal.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Yes, that's the theory.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
But what we want to demonstrate is that

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
we can have a large-scale detection.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
If you want to do imaging,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
you need a large-scale detection.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I mean, as long as you don't let the graphene stack up,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
it may be a very small point.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Then if you use the ENCCD to collect the whole thing,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
you will get the same signal at every point.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
You will get the same image.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
As long as you don't let the graphene stack up,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
it's okay.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Yes, that's right.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
But now I don't know how big a single crystal can grow.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I remember it was about 10 to 20 microns.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So how big should each data point be

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
for you to collect such a good signal?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Oh, you mean...

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Our spatial resolution can be up to about 10 microns.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
What is the limit of this thing?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:32.000
For example, at 10 microns or lower,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
under the ENCCD resolution scale,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
these five microns...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Okay, so in our pixel,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
it's 10x10 microns.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
But maybe in some pixels,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
the graphene coverage is 80%.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
In some places, the graphene coverage is 50%.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Then the response of these two places will be different.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
When one place is critical coupling,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
the other pixel will not be critical coupling.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Okay.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
So on average,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000
you won't be completely critical coupling.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
So have you ever thought about

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
getting a sample out of a tapestry?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
We haven't thought about it before.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Actually, we can try it.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Because what we've been thinking about is

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
that we have to find a way to make it very large

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
so that we can see the entire neural network at once.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Got it. Thank you.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Anyone else have any questions?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
No questions?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Anyone has a question? Sorry.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
No, thank you.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Thank you.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Very good talk.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Okay.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Thank you.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
If there are no questions,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
let's give Jason another round of applause

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
for bringing us today's talk.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Okay, that's it for today.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I'll turn off the recording first.
