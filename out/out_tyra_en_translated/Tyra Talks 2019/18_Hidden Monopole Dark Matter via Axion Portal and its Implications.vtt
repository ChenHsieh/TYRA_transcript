00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Chair Talk.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Our speaker today is Shuyu He.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Shuyu is now doing theoretical physics at Tohoku University in Tokyo, Japan.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
He specializes in the theory of dark matter.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Shuyu He is actually a long-time friend of mine.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm sorry, I'm today's host, Zhang Yanyou.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Shuyu He majored in physics.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
After graduating from physics, he went to Taiwan University to do his master's degree in dark matter.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
He followed up with Mr. He Xiaoguang.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Then he came to Caltech and met me.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Now he's doing his PhD at Tohoku.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
I don't know if I'm saying this correctly, but he should be graduating soon, right?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Next year, in September.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes, he's graduating soon.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
The topic he's going to talk to us about today is

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Hidden Monopole Dark Matter via XCO Portal and its Implications for Direct Search and Bind-Up Experiments.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
This paper is actually already published in the archive.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
If you look at the first page of the video, you can see the archive number.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, by the way, when you clap, you have to turn on the microphone.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Only then can we hear you clap.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Shuyu He to give us a wonderful speech today.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Thank you, Zhang Yanyou, for introducing me.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
As you can see, the title of my speech is quite long.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Let me talk about a few key points first.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
My speech today will focus on dark matter.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Dark Matter is the Chinese translation of dark matter.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
I think if you don't usually do theoretical work, you should hear this term a lot.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Maybe through some of Taiwan's programs, you may hear the term dark matter.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Then you can see this hidden monopole in front of you.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Monopole is the Chinese translation of the word monopole.

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
If you have studied electronics, you will know that when we discuss electronics, we do not have a monopole.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Hidden, I will explain what it means.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Then there is action.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
In my last speech, I basically made a long introduction.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
But today, because of time, I should mainly focus on the introduction of dark matter.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So action, I might first mention it a little bit.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Then I will talk about the details of our model.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
It is also applied in DirectSearch.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
That is, directly detect the experiment of dark matter and the so-called Bindang Experiments.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I will mention these details at the end.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Let's go straight to the introduction of dark matter.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
What you see on the screen now is our so-called example physical standard model.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Generally called Standard Model.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
This model has been verified by a large number of experiments.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It is a very accurate theory.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Simply put, you can look at this picture.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Look at this E, this E is the so-called Electron.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
This is the basic example that everyone is familiar with.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
The focus is on Mu and Tau.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
These examples are actually easy to find in the universe.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
Then there is the so-called Mu, E, Mu, Mu and Mu, Tau is the so-called neutral value.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
This is generally more unfamiliar.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
But I won't touch this part in today's speech.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
You can see that the red part above is the so-called Quarks.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Like this straight neutral value that everyone is more familiar with.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Basically they are not basic examples.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
They are composed of these Quarks.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
For example, this Proton is composed of two Up Quarks and one Down Quark.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
That is the U and D on the graph.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
There are heavier Quarks in the graph.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
The purple part on the right side of the graph is the so-called basic force.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Everyone is more familiar with this Gamma.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
That is the particle in the upper right corner.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It is the battery function that we are more familiar with.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
The G below is the so-called強作用.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
The Z and W are the so-called weakest.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
In this regard, these two particles may not be often heard of.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Basically, today I am more focused on this Photon part.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I will introduce the so-called Hidden Photon later.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
There is a Higgs in the middle of this graph.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
You may hear this news often.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
There is a report like this.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
This Higgs is the source of the so-called Origin of Mass.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That's why matter has mass.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
This Higgs has been predicted to exist for a long time.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
The reason is that before it was discovered,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
the history of standard models has been verified for a long time.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It is a very accurate theory.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
But this Higgs has not been discovered.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
This is the motivation for us to find it.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
So I built a large-scale quantum detector in Europe later.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
The so-called LHC.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
I spent a lot of money on it.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I found it in 2013.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
If I remember correctly, it was six or five years ago.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I don't know. It should be 2014.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm sorry.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
What I want to say is that we should be able to see your mouse.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So you can move your mouse.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
You can try it.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
You can use it if you want.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Thank you for your advice.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
Higgs was discovered in 2014.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Then, of course, the next year,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
it seems that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Higgs.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
It means that the last puzzle of the standard model has been found.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Although the standard model is so successful,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
there are still many problems that cannot be explained.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
These problems are listed on the right side of this video.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
There are quite a lot.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Like the first so-called dark matter.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
I'll talk about why I want to have dark matter.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
There is also the so-called dark energy.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Dark energy is currently an explanation of why the universe is accelerating.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
We observe that the universe is not static.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
It is constantly expanding.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
The only explanation is dark energy.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Simply put, it may provide some

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
similar

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
anti-gravity feeling.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
There is also the so-called quantum gravity.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
There is also the so-called gravity problem.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
There is also the so-called gravity problem.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
There is also the so-called gravity problem.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
There is also the so-called gravity asymmetry.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
In other words, our universe.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Our universe has the so-called anti-matter and positive matter.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
But we found that our universe is basically dominant.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
This matter is not anti-matter.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
This is also the reason why we can't know.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
This is a problem.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
But although there are so many questions.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
My speech today is mainly focused on dark matter.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
If you are interested in this question, you can google it.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
You can know more details.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
Since we are talking about dark matter, we must do some basic introduction of dark matter.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
First of all, let's talk about why we know the existence of dark matter.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
It may be easier for everyone to understand the upper left corner of this picture.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
The upper left corner is the rotation curve of the star system.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
You can see the shape of this picture.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Its tangent axis is a planet

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
revolving around the rotation speed of the star system.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
The horizontal axis is the distance between the star system and the center of the galaxy.

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
According to Newton's law and Newton's law of gravitation,

08:05.000 --> 08:15.000
we can simply calculate that the rotation speed of the star system should be reduced.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
If it is a galaxy, it should be reduced.

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
But what we find is not the red line, but the white line on the graph.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
This may imply that there are some objects that we can't see.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
It also provides gravity.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
This gravity will produce additional gravitation to keep the star system at a certain speed.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
This is the most basic evidence of dark matter.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
In addition, there is a so-called gravity path.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
For example, if the dark matter is in the universe,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
it will cause some stars to shine.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
The light will be distorted by the dark matter.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
We can see the circular effect in the picture.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
This is the so-called gravity effect.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
There is also the CMB spectrum in the lower left corner.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
This is more detailed.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I can skip it first.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
The one on the bottom right is quite famous.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Someone once considered that there may be no dark matter,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
but that Newton's law needs to be corrected.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
There is also the so-called modified gravity theory.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
Britt-Crosser is a more preferable evidence of dark matter.

09:28.000 --> 09:36.000
You can see that Britt-Crosser has a pink and purple part on the graph.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
The purple part is basically the matter that will provide gravity.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
In other words, I just talked about the gravitational projection above.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
We can know by gravitational projection that some invisible matter will provide gravity.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
That is the purple part of the graph.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
The red part is some visible matter that we know.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
It may be electrons or some light.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
We can detect it through binoculars or satellites.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
We found that these two crosses coincide.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
We found that the red part will interact with each other.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
The purple part will just go through each other.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
In other words, it will not have the same effect as our matter.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
For example, this may also provide evidence that there is a very weak matter in the universe.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
It's called dark matter.

10:29.000 --> 10:37.000
Anyway, we found a lot of evidence from experiments or observations.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
So dark matter is not just an evidence.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Its evidence is very overwhelming.

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
Since we believe in the existence of dark matter, we want to measure some of its data.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
At present, according to our so-called cosmological standard model.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
We just talked about the standard model of gravitational physics.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
There is a standard model of cosmology.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Under that model, we do the measurement.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
We found that the current energy ratio of the universe is like the picture.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
This is what you see on the screen right now.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
We generally call it cosmic pi.

11:15.000 --> 11:23.000
We found that 70% of the universe's energy is contributed by dark energy.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Dark matter contributes about one-fourth.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
Only 5% is contributed by the so-called barrier.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
In other words, most of the universe can see the so-called stars.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
It only accounts for 5% of the total energy.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Anyway, the focus of our speech today is on dark matter.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
As long as you know that dark matter accounts for about one-fourth of the universe's energy.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
What characteristics does dark matter need to meet?

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
First of all, I just said that we can't see it because of dark matter.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
So it can't have a battery interaction.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
Otherwise, we should be able to easily measure the signal with a device.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
So this tells us that dark matter should be an electromagnetic.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
It can't carry electricity.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Then again, its age must be older than the age of the universe.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Or it's very stable.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Otherwise, if it changes, like we know some basic examples.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It's not stable.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Uh, like the one on the screen just now.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
In that standard model, it's called the second value.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
For example, the second value can change to the electron.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Add some neutrons.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
So some particles are not stable.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
So if dark matter is not stable, it might change.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
If I change, it might disappear.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Then we won't see it.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
So basically, it has to be long enough for you.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
In addition, from what I just said, this CMB.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
And some early observations of the universe's nuclear fusion.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
We found that it is a non-atomic substance.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
It's not like the quarks we just talked about.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That kind of thing.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
And finally, the so-called star structure is formed.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
We estimate its movement speed.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
In other words, particles should move in the universe.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Like the quarks I just mentioned.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
It has its own velocity.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
But the result of our observation is that our dark matter.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Its movement speed must be very small.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It's almost as small as the speed of light.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
But to put it more directly.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
It's almost as fast as the speed of light.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Compared to the speed of light.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
This is easy to understand.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Do you know that dark matter itself has gravity?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
If there is gravity.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
They may continue to attract.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
And form some kind of cluster feeling.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
If the dark matter forms a cluster.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Other things like particles.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Some gravitational materials will also be attracted.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
If you are attracted.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
It will slowly form a star system.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Then this star system becomes what we are now.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
That is to say, these stars are observed in the universe.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I found that most of the stars are large.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Most of the stars are large-diameter structures.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
That means that the dark matter must move very slowly.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Because if the dark matter moves very fast.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It's hard to form a cluster.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
If it's hard to form a cluster.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
What we should see is.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
A star with a relatively small-diameter structure.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Not large-diameter.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
So the observation of large-diameter structures.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Dark matter moves very slowly.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
This is basically the nature of dark matter.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Why is this nature important?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Because I just talked about the standard model.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
There is no way to explain dark matter.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
So it means that the standard model must be extended.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
So you have to write some models.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
When you write a model.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
You have to make your model.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Some new substances.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
New particles to meet these characteristics.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
This is the basic knowledge we need to know when we do theory.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
There is no problem here.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Does anyone want to know about dark matter?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
It seems that everyone can accept it.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Then I will continue.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Since we just talked about modeling.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Our theorists.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Have to come up with some.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Models or scenarios to explain.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
What is dark matter?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
More popular is the so-called.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Weakly Interactive Massive Particle.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Generally referred to as WIMP.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Why is WIMP more popular?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Because.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
If you use theory to estimate.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Find this kind of particle.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
What about the effectiveness?

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
It's very close to what I just said in the first page.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
At the same time, the quality is also very close.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
So this WIMP will be very.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Close to the extent of our so-called circuit theory.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
This is actually more likely to be experimentally.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Go.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Measure.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Of course, there are many.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
This kind of example.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
That's like the so-called supersymmetry theory.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
That's like the so-called.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Some additional symmetry theory will also predict this kind of WIMP.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Candidate.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Then below me.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
The blue part is.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Is.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Different from this kind of WIMP.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Candidate.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
That's what I'm talking about today.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I'm talking about this hidden.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Basically, it's a.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Torque defect.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
It's a topological defect.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It's very different from the general WIMP.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It's even in the early universe.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
The mechanism is also very different.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I'll mention it a little bit later.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Simply put, I can simply say.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
WIMP is basically.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It was created by heat balance in the early days.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
You can imagine that the universe was a big.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
There are a lot of particles.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
There are electrons and light.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Then these particles have high energy.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Then these high energy can hit some.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Heavier particles.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
That's how WIMP was created in the early universe.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
That's right.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
So what about these torque defects?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
What about the axis?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Its formation mechanism is not the same as WIMP.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Then I will explain.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Then I don't want blue.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
It's because of these.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Particles are constantly mentioned in the back.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Like the axis and the invisible light.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I didn't particularly talk about what is HIDDEN.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
HIDDEN is a sector of the visible world.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
For example, I just talked about the role of the battery.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Then we can.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
WIMP is very thematic.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I can say that there may be another.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
A weaker battery.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Then I call it HIDDEN.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Electromagnetic.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Then you will naturally have HIDDEN photons.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Then there are a lot of candidates.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Like SIMP.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
SIMP is Strongly Integrated Massive Particles.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I also sent a few papers on this work a few years ago.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
It seems that my first TAL speech is about SIMP.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Then there are so-called Gravity Nodes.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
There are a lot of things like this.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Basically, you can write a book.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Introduce these candidates of Fragment.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Anyway, I will focus on the blue part today.

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
Since there is a theory, of course there is also an experiment.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
So there are a lot of people in the world right now.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Whether in Japan, the United States or Europe.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Maybe a lot of time wants to detect dark matter.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Basically, they don't want to detect the so-called WIMP.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Because WIMP has more people doing theoretical models.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
More people are doing it.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
They all assume that WIMP.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
In fact, WIMP.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
It may have some interaction with the nucleus.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Of course, these interactions are not direct.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
It may pass through some media.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
These media may be new physics.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Maybe it will pass through some.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Even like the fingertips I just mentioned.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Basically, this is the topic of my speech today.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Through some new.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
New fermions or new bosons.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Particle to do media.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Then through this media.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Dark matter can interact with the nucleus.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Then we can go.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Do the theoretical calculation.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Then compare with the experiment.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
The so-called experimental comparison is like the picture on the right.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
It has.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
There are some upper bound.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Like the one on the picture.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
It is.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
The three-color interface of WIMP and Nucleon.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Simply put, it's a three-color intensity.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
The horizontal axis is the mass of WIMP.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yes.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
There are a lot of pictures on the Internet.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
You see.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
There are already a lot of things like COPE.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Xenon.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Like this.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Uh.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
There was this a while ago.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Uh.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Xenon OneTown also released some new upper bound.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Like this.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
Anyway, we have a lot of time to measure this dark matter.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Like this.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Okay, so this is the current.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Uh.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I'm just going to do the basic.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Background introduction.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I want to.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
OK.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I have a question.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Good question.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
But what you're showing now is.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It's almost.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
One to 10,000.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
10,000 GEV, right?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Yes.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Will you discuss it in this range today?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
No, it's a good question.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
No.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
But.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I want to.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah, because it's actually in.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
You see.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
You see.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Upper bound.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
In the heavy part.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
His.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
The trend is always.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You can predict that it will continue to go up.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Extend.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
That's because.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Because.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Uh.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
But we know.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
We can fix that.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Dark matter.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
That event.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Is.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Can.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
We can know.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
We can press.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Then we can know this.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Strength.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
So you can go.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
To behave this.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
He's in.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
What's his behavior in the heavy part?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
For example, we.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Basically, we're just doing an extension.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Then, of course, because we're talking about this today.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Monopole.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
It's very heavy.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
It's even more than 10.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
So.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
That's right.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
But basically.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
We just extend this upper bound.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
And then do it like this.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Is that okay?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Okay.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Thank you.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Okay.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Okay.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Then I have no problem.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Let's just introduce our main character today.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
The so-called hidden mobile.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
So why do you have to study hidden mobile?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Because it's actually hidden mobile.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
He is.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
To put it bluntly, he's a pretty good candidate.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Why?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
There are two very simple reasons.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
That is.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
He is.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
If you are in the universe.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Early.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
If there are some changes.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
That is.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
It can be very natural.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Okay.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I have a simple picture.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
To explain this.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
That's right.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
You can think of it before the change.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
That is.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
The square on this picture.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
This rectangle.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm talking about the universe.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Of course.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
It's not just empty.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
I'm just saying.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Before the change.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
His.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
This.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
The shape of a factory is.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It's zero.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
He's got nothing.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
That's it.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And then after the change.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Maybe.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Well.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Some blocks in the universe.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Will.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
There will be some new ones.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Maybe some.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
New scalar field.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
He will send.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
There will be some vacuum expectations.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
And then this scalar field.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
There will be some random directions.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
That's because the universe.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
The universe is.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Do you know that the universe is a cause and effect ratio?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So we'll have some domains.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
That these domains are.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Cause.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Causality connection.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Connected.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
That is.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
It has a cause and effect relationship.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
So in different domains.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
His.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
The direction may be different.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
This is a bit like you.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Maybe.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Electrical engineering or some.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
It's your magnet.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
There will be some.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
That domain phenomenon is very similar.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Anyway.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
So.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
In the following.

23:03.000 --> 23:03.000


23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I seem to have a typo below.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
It should be after the change.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
That's not before the change.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I just changed it.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
So there's this random direction.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Then you might have a certain chance.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
It's just like.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
In this picture.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
The four in the lower right corner.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
He just formed a radiation.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
There is no.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
That's the radiation.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
It's like our battery factory.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
That.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Since there's a battery factory.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
We can find the center.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
So you can say.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
What about this center?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
It can be identified.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
It's a.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Maybe it's a kind of.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Something with a magnet.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
In our example.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
It's a magnet.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
It's got a flux.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Yeah.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
So there's this magnet.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
It will produce.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
It will produce this magnetic field.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
So.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
For example, if there is a change.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
These.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
These.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
These objects will naturally occur.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
That's the red dot on the picture.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
That's it.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Then we can estimate.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
This number density.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I'm on the screen.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Uh.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
The data is written.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
It's this nm.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
It's this.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
The number density of the monopole.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
It will.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
It will be equal to this.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
1 divided by this.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Horizontal size of this.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
The three-dimensional.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
It's the volume.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
That is to say, roughly.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
It's probably an average one.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
In a.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
This British law.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Connected.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
In this volume.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
It will produce a.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Magnetic field.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
That's it.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah, that's it.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
This.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
This.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
This dh.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
This horizon distance.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
It's roughly.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
It's about the same as this.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
This.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
This.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Negative three-dimensional.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
That's it.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Then we can estimate.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
This number density.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
It's h.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Negative three-dimensional.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Then we can estimate.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
It's this.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
The density.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I have a question.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Good question.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
My question is.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
That is.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
My question is.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
The main thing is that molecule.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Is 1.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
That is to say.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
If you are in a causal.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Connected horizon.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
There is more than one.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
It doesn't look like.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
It's a monopole.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
It looks like.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
It's a dipole.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Or a multipole.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Right?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Yeah, there's a lot of.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
But.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
So.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
I see.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
So.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
You would say.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
It's one over.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Horizon size.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Because.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Basically.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
You have to.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Usually.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Write a P.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
P is probability.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Uh-huh.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
But.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I didn't go.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
To see how to calculate.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
That depends on model.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
But I'm just giving it a scale.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Like my paper here.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It's just.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
It's just a number.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I can't.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
It's not that I can't.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I didn't really go.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Calculate so carefully.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Because the reason is simple.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Because.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
You know, there are a lot of experiments.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Yeah.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Hahaha.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Sorry.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Yeah.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Yeah.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
How much density should this monopole have?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Or is it just density?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Because we know that density.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
That's the mass density.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
That's the mass density.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
So it's going to be very natural in the universe.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
If there's a change.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yeah.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
That's actually.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
You know, there's a lot of change in the universe.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
So it's very natural.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
It's a natural thing.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
If there's the same thing in this hidden sector.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Then this level 13.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
This hidden level 13 can be produced by itself.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
It's very natural.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
And then there's him.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Because he's Thorpe.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Thorpe.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Thorpe.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Thorpe.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
So he has a kind of his own.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
The nature of Thorpe.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't know if you're familiar with Thorpe.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Like Thorpe, which is usually used to talk about Thorpe.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
That's Mark Bay.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
You know, Mark Bay.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
It's the same as the field circle.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Thorpe is the same.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
It's a more mathematical language.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
That is to say, this kind of Thorpe.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Thorpe's object has its own.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
This is quantum number.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
That's quantum number.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
If it's.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
If it's not destroyed.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It's a very good hand.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
So if it's a hand, it means.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
If this model has this quantum number.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
It's a very stable thing.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
That chemical reaction is not electrical.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
You can't.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Before and after the reaction.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Before the reaction, it's very.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Total charge is.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
It's positive and negative.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
And then you get negative after the reaction.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Something like that.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
That can explain the dark matter.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
This hidden model.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Why is it stable?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Because he can't detect some particles.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
It also has the same Thorpe.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
This number.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
So anyway.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
So this is two basic reasons.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
That's the hidden model.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Good.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Of course.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Uh.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I'm in the hidden model.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
So basically there are some.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Of course, some studies of the same theory.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Like what.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Su5 theory.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
They naturally have some models.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
But what about these models?

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
If you calculate it, you'll find it.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
It's going to be a lot.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Yeah.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
That's going to lead to.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
It's going to be the same as we observe.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It's going to be different from what we observe.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Because we're in the universe right now.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
The universe has no evidence of any particles.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
And then that's going to lead to another question.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
That's what this is.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Why isn't the universe like this?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
There's no such thing as a general model.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Well, that might have to be generally explained by inferential.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Yeah.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Well, this is another one.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
The bottom line is that the early universe will explode.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
And then it's going to suck up the density of this model.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Yeah.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And here, it's not the same as my hidden model.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Even if I'm in the dark matter.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
So.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
It's going to have a lot of density.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Yeah, basically, it's supposed to be.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It has to be produced after this explosion.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
If it's produced before the explosion,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
It's going to be sucked up, too.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
OK.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Good.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
That's what I was trying to do.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
You have a wrong notation.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
That DH is.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Equal to H or equal to H minus.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Minus.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
It should be minus.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Minus.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Because you don't seem to be right about these two, do you?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
I might be writing.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
I might be typing.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah, I might have a short time.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Yeah.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Which one is the title?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Yeah, it's supposed to be three-dimensional.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
You're talking about that.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Three-dimensional.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
OK.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Good.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Thank you.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Good.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
that.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
I just mentioned the experiment.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
That is to say, we.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Can we measure this?

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
This model can measure this hidden model.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
The answer is no.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Because I just said.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
If you're this dark matter.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Really with.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
What about the effect of this box?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
I need some media.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
So if it's just a.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Hidden model, this model.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Maybe there's no way.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
There's this connection.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
So I don't have to.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Do some extra extension.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
That is to say, you have to add extra particles.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Let this model and this box.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
There's a connection.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Good.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
There are a few possibilities.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Good.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
The first one is the Higgs portal.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
That is to say.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
In the middle, they rely on Higgs particles to make media.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
That's a simple estimate.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
I'm not going to explain it.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
That is, I found this prediction.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
This.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
The war front is very small.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
There's another one that wants to go through this vector.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
For example, the middle is.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
The media is a kind of light.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
These things.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
That.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
That.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Sorry.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I don't study because of this.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Toppling is very small because.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
This kind of vector.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It's been limited by a lot of experiments.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
So it's usually this.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
It's not big enough.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
So our research theme today is.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
This action.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
You mean.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
This media is made by action.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
That action is the most primitive.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
The first reason is that he solved it.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Just maybe.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I didn't get this strong CP problem.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Yeah, and then in this hypothesis.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Or some super-symmetry.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
It's natural to predict this kind of action particle.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah, so.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
The action particle may exist in the intelligent world.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Well, actually, as long as you know the action, it's a simple one.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
There's no, it's a, it's a pure particle.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
That's it.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
It's not self-selected.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
It's a spin-zero particle.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And then it's a pseudo-scalar at the same time.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
The so-called pseudo means that it's in this mirror symmetry.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
It's got a symbol.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
I mean.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Uh.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
So.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
If it's a normal scale, it won't be like Higgs.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Higgs is just a normal scale.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
It's in.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
But the parity is in the mirror symmetry.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It doesn't have a minus sign in the mirror symmetry.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah, anyway, so, anyway, so action is a.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It's a pseudo-scalar.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
So, basically, what I'm doing today is assuming.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
This hidden multiple.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
With this, uh, uh, with the middle of the nucleus through this action to make a connection.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Oh.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Well, then it's a more complex model.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Then this side.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Maybe a lot of people don't understand.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah, I'll talk about it a little bit.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
The earliest.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Uh, put it out.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
That is to say, a theory is very natural to have multiple.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
It's this one.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
He's also a theoretical physicist.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
He's in the Netherlands.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And then he has a Nobel Prize.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Then he proposed this so-called SU2.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
SU2 is basically a standard symmetry.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Well, to put it simply, people are more familiar with this battery.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It's a U1 symmetry.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
That U1, it's a.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
It's a non-exchange group symmetry.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
The so-called exchange is to say.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
So, as you know, people have learned to be more familiar with rotation.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Basically, the three-dimensional rotation is a.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
The role of a non-exchange group symmetry.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Because you, you first turn from the y-axis and then from the z-axis.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
You can turn from the z-axis and then from the y-axis.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
It's different.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
That's why U1 is an exchange.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
The exchange is that it's a flat rotation.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Flat rotation is an exchangeable.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
That.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah, he proposed a SU2.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
This non-exchange group symmetry.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
The theory.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
And then he added three of these.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
New scale.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
For example, you can see this in the picture.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Phi 1, phi 2, phi 3.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
What about the structure of this theory?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
What if this happens?

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
This self-reliance.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
What about the destruction?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It will be very natural to produce this.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
That he was a long time ago.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
With another one.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
This.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
This.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
This.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
They didn't cooperate before.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
They both came up with this idea.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
That's it.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah, and then down here is this.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
The screen is some of the equations.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
You don't really need to.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
To understand.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
You just need to know that I'm using pink to mark this.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Like EH.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
EH is similar to our battery.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
The battery.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Just because it's a hidden sector.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
So I add an H to mark it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's different from our average.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
This.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
The size of the battery.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
And then VH.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
On the right.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
The VH on the right is this.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
The vacuum expectation value of the storage plant.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
That he will.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
It's related to this.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Anyway, it's a model.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
That he will naturally have this.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
That's it.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
You don't have to look at it.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Of course, it's what I just said.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
This model.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
If there is a self-reliance.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Self-reliance destruction.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Then it will produce U1.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
That U1 will become.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Simply put.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
That is to say.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
The role of our average battery is.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
It's U1.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
U1 symmetry.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
So if he has a U1H.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
It's natural to have one.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
In the hidden sector.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
This battery.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
What about this alpha H?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
This is the red one.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
This alpha H is.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
It should be the economic structure parameter.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Yeah.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
That's the same.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
He's in the hidden sector right now.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Oh.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Look at the time.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
About 20 minutes.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Good.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
That's what I just said.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
If this model.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
If you assume this model.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
He's this.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Energy is self-reliance.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
That is to say.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
If his energy is finite.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
That will naturally be a.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Very stable.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
This.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
This state solution.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It's like the solution of Soliton.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
He's a model.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
And then there's some of this model.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Some new particles.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
That's the first one.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Gamma H is hidden photon.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Of course, hidden photon.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
It's not qualitative.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
It's not electronic.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
It's not.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
It's not.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
There's no magnetic field.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
And then this alpha.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
This.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
This is what I just said.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Some of this model.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Scalar like this.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
That's a lot of mass.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
But he didn't.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
There's no electric field.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
There's no magnetic field.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
And then the third one.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
This is.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Standard symmetrical example.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
We usually call it W.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
The government.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
He's actually talking to us.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
The first page of that standard model.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
That W is very similar.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
That's the same.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
He's in the hidden sector.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
That.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
That's natural.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
He's going to have an electric field.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Yeah.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
And then the last one, M.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
That's our protagonist.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
That's the model.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
That's natural.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
It has to be qualitative.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
And then since it's a model.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Of course, it has to have magnetic field.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
It's magnetic charge.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Of course.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
There's a question here.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
That is to say.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
If it is.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
He's a.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
If it's a model.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Why does he have an electric field?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
It's kind of weird.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
That's a very interesting theory.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
He was in Princeton a long time ago.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Now in Princeton.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
This Witten.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
A.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It's one of the most powerful.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It's supposed to be the top linguist.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
He was a long time ago.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
The so-called Witten effect.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
For example, through this Witten effect.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
This monopole.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
It will also have.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
This electric field.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
This is quite interesting.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
This is when I first learned it.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
I think it's amazing.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
And it's very simple.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Okay, so.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
So why is there this.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Electric field?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
So if you say.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
If you today.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
As I just said.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
If you have one now.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
The theory of this one.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Basically, we can also write it on the screen.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
This equation.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
This Lagrangian.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Okay, so back to the front.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
You see this.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
The Lagrangian has a cth.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
That's cth.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's called cth.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
For example, we.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
We can write this.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
And then it won't violate anything.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
No, no, no, no, no.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
There's no reason.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
It doesn't exist.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
So we can write it down.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Okay.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Well, usually this term is.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
We don't consider it because.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
It can be written as a whole.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
And in the whole.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Basically, it doesn't have any physical effect.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Yeah, maybe you're not familiar with it.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Then I'll mention it a little bit.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
So when will this term have a physical effect?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
That's if you have it today.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
You have this.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Monopole background.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
If you have a monopole background today.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Plus this cth term.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
You can find out that this monopole.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
It also has a background.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Well, usually I put this kind of thing with a background.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
It's called Dayong.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
But we're talking about this today.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Or just call it monopole.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
So simply put.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
If you have this cth term today.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
If you have this monopole at the same time.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Yeah, because I just said.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
I just said.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
In this series.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
In this series.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
There's always going to be a monopole.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Yeah.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
So you have this cth term and monopole.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Then you calculate it.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
You'll find that it should have a monopole at the same time.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Well, since there's a monopole.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
It's going to have a monopole.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
OK, so his monopole is in.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
The shape of the red part in the lower right corner.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Yeah.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
So that you can get a feel for it.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
I'm going to show you some calculations.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Yeah, like this.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
For example, you just got out of this Lagrangian.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
You can write down its equation motion.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
It's the one on the top left.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
The one in the upper left corner.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
The yellow equation.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
And through our definition of this battery voltage.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
It's in the upper right corner.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Like what?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
FJ 0 equals EJ.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
This kind of thing.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
E is the power plant.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
And then B is the power plant.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
You can get that.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
We're most familiar with the Maxwell equation.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Like that.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
You know, the frequency.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
The power plant.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
If it's usually 0.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Well, if it's usually 0.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
If there's no power consumption, it should be 0.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Yeah.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
So we can say this.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
This Maxwell equation.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
So if you're today.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Through this Maxwell equation.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
If you have a multiple.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
You can do the same thing.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Calculate this voltage.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Okay.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
So if you're interested.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
You can.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
After the lecture.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
You can take a closer look at this.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
It's actually pretty simple.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
OK.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
So you can just look at this theta H.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
This theta H is in this.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
In the micro-division.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
In this.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
In the delta dot.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
So that means theta.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
It's basically.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
It can also be a.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Space function.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
Because I'm going to extend it later.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
It's an action.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Action.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
It's a.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
It's a.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
It's a factory.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
That factory.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
It's a space function.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
That is to say.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
If you enter today.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
It's not just theta.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
It's a.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
It's an action.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Then this.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
This.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
What about the voltage?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
It's not going to be at the origin.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
That.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
That origin.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
It's going to be in space.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
Through this action.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
It will.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
It will be carried by this action field.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
OK.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Okay.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Is there any problem here?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Although it's a bit difficult.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Yes, I have a question.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
So basically you.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Model will be coupled to dark photon.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
But it's with.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
It's you.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
The coupling of monopole and dark photon.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
You have to argue now.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
It's like saying.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Its coupling is dependent on.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
One.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
A field that can change with space.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
That's the theta.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
And then.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
You said that.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
That theta.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
You think.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
It's a field.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
So you said it.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
OK.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
It's x.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Is that so?

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
No.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
That is.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
You can repeat.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
For example, look at me.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
I'm not writing a theta.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Like this.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
I can change this theta.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
It's a time and space function.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
You can.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
So this thing is your x.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Yeah.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
But.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
That is to say.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
You are now.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
It's basically you.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
It's his.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
That.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
That monopole charge.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
So he basically.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
You and.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Dark photon.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
The coupling is.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Basically, I'll write it down.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
It's him.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Do you know what he looks like?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Or what?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Is that what you mean?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Undensity.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Um.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
What did you say?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
I didn't hear it.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Hello.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Hello.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Hello.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Um.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Did you hear that?

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Did you hear that?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Hello.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I heard his voice.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Zhang Yong.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Zhang Yong is missing.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Why?

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Did the others hear my voice?

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Have.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Zhang Yong is missing.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
No.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Wait a minute.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
He is.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Is he online?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Have.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Have.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
But no sound.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Yeah.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Wait a minute.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
I don't know what's going on.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
I have.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm going to send him a message.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
I pressed it, didn't I?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Wait a minute.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
He's gone.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
So I should keep talking and wait for him.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
You have to wait for him.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Have you seen my screen?

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Have you seen my screen?

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
No.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
No?

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
I just pressed share.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Have you seen my screen?

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Have you seen my screen?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
He's gone.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
He's gone.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
I'm still recording.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Then I'll continue.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Because...

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Yeah.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
I'll talk to him later.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
I have a question.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Is the charge

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
the same as our EM charge?

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
No.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
It's different.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's different.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
So you're basically

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
copying the EM wave again.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Yeah, it's very simple.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
It's a very small coupling

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
to our whole world.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
It doesn't have to be big or small.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
It's all right.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
But the main thing is that we can't

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
get close to it.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah, basically...

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
I'll talk about it later.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
In fact, the coupling is quite large.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
That is to say...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
I don't know if I'm using EH now.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I'm using the electron structure constant.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Like I just said, alpha H.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Like I'm in the back.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
The numerical study is about

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
close to 1.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
But the general...

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
You know, the general electron

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
effect electron structure constant

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
is about

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
10 to the power of 2

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
divided by 137 or something.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Yeah.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
I'm back.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
I'm sorry.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
If you just answered

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
and I skipped it completely,

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
it doesn't matter.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Just ignore me.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm sorry.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
We can discuss it later.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
OK.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Let's continue.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Anyway, this is actually quite simple.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
You can see the video later.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
You can push it yourself.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
If I were a professor,

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
I would ask this question.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
It's really simple.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
OK.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
This is my model here.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
This is Benchmark Point.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Yeah.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
In fact, this model has already

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
done some detailed research.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
But so far,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
no one has really considered

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
how this multiple

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
and

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
the numerical effect through action.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
But we're...

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
My boss is the first one

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
to come up with this idea.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Then he asked me to do the calculation.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
So you can see this on the picture.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
This picture is made by someone else.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Yeah.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
I put the credit in the upper right corner.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
For example,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
you can see this tangent axis on the picture.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
This is the size of the energy structure.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
The horizontal axis is the size of the positive and negative expectant.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
It corresponds to the value of this multiple.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Yeah.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
That's the red part.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
That's the red part.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
We're going to consider this.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Consider the red part on the picture.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
The red part on the picture.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
That is to say.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I forgot to say something.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
In this model,

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
in addition to this multiple,

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
you can do dark matter.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
The one in the table.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
W.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
W positive can also do dark matter.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Why is this model?

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
It considers

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
I'm 100%

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
This dark matter is contributed by multiple.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Yeah.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
So consider maybe 10% or 35% like this.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
Then we use its result directly.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
To do the analysis.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Yeah.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
But anyway, in principle,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
we can reproduce its results.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Yeah.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
But our paper here is mainly.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
As long as.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Estimate a number level.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Yeah.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
We use its result directly.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Okay.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Then we assume that this.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Dark matter is contributed by 35%.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Dark matter is.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
35% of it is contributed by this multiple.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Okay.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
In this case,

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
the average is about 0.7.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Then this multiple is very heavy.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
About 200 TeV.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Yeah.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
That's for reference.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Like the one just now.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
I asked before.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Is that.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
The experiment of WIMP.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
It's going to be 10 to the power of 4.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
So 10 to the power of 4.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
It's only about 10 TeV.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
So it's probably still.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
This is still.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
Ten times heavier than the average experiment.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
Above.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
It can even be heavier.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Okay.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Anyway.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Then I'm going to do it again.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Our work is very simple.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Is that we.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Consider the graph on the right.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
On the left.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
With this.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
The idea is that M is multiple.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Then N is Neutron.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Then through the middle.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
This action.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
No border.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
That.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
This action and this Neutron.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
The last one is.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
It's easier.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Just assume there's a.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Yukai.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Yukai interaction.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
You know this theory.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Right.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Yukai should be quite famous.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
It's Japan.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
It's a theoretical science.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Yeah.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Yeah.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
What's more difficult is.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
How to calculate multiple.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
With this action.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
This interaction.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
That's it.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
It's going to be.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
The so-called winter effect.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
That is to say.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
You can imagine.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
This.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Uh.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
More.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
More.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Uh.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
How?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Because of that.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
His.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
If there is an action.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
This charge.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
It will.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
It will spread in space.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
In some sense.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
It will.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
It will affect this.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Uh.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Neutron.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
For example.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
If you have this.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
If this is moving.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
This.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Neutron.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
He might feel this.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
This.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
This movement.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Yeah.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
So.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Let's say they have an interaction.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Yeah.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Through this action.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
That's pretty hard.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Because of this.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
We can't just write this.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
This action.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
With mobile.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
This interaction.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
It's going to be through this.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Winter effect.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
That's it.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Some of my boss's ideas.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Yeah.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
That.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
If we can calculate this.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
These interactions.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
What about it?

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
We can also calculate this process.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
This color scheme.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Because you remember.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
We were just in time.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
You have to compare with the experiment.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
That time.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
They measured the color scheme.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
With.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
The same relationship.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
As long as we calculate it.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
You can do it.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Compare with time.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
And then to our model.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Some parameters.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Constraint.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Good.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Well, since we're actually.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
We also consider some other experiments.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Like the so-called experience.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Yeah.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
And these.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
This experiment is mainly to measure some.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
More long life.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
This.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Some particles.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
That action.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
It's one of the possibilities.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Yeah.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
We also put this.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
This time limit.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Also put it in this.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Yeah.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Analysis.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Yeah.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Okay.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
There's a lot of time in this regard.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Like this.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
On the left.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
See this charm on the picture.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
And ship.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
And charm is already given.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Some upper bound.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Yeah.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Some restrictions.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
And ship is.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Future perspective.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
That's it.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
There's also this FA on the picture.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
FA is basically.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
This.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
The intensity of the interaction.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
That is to say.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
If you F is super big.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
But this strength is weaker.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Yeah.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Yeah.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
We can also see this FA.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
That's this.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
The strength of this action.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Probably.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
It's related to this FA.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
You'll see it later.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Okay.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Since this is the mother.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
I'll bring it over soon.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Because this is too detailed.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I'll tell you the story.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
The way to finish my theoretical computing work.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
That's the same.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
We have this model.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Write down this Lagrangian.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
And then the last one.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
What about this?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
It's a constant.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Now, I'm going to do this.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Let's do it.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Promoted to a.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
This one.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
It's a dynamical.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
The field.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Like this.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
That's our action.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
That's the action here.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
But I'm normal.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
By this FA.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
That is to say.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
What about this?

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
It's not a unit.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Yeah.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
That.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Once we write down this Lagrangian.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
We can solve it.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
To solve this.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Motion equation.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
That's the equation of motion.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
That's the picture.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
That's the picture.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
This line below.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
A little complicated.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
And then we'll put in some boundary conditions.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
That is to say.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
We have to assume that this.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
The energy of the system is limited.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
It can't be infinite.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
It's not going to happen.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
So this action field is at the origin.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
To go to zero.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
And then at the same time.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
It's infinite.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
It's going to be.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Close to this.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
A constant.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
This constant is called Zeta 0.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
With this equation of motion and boundary conditions.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
We can solve.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Equation of motion.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Whether it's using numbers or some.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Uh, just solve it.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
The picture is.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
The picture is our result.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
That green.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
That's what.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
The orange one is the result of our numbers.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Uh, that's what we're going to do.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Solve the original equation directly.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Of course, we have some mirroring.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
The blue curve is the result of the number.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Then I found out that we.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
The solution of the solution is very good.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Yeah, I didn't say that.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Because it's a little complicated.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Okay, so.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
So you can see this action.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
This, this, this distribution.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
That's the picture.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
It's the distance from the distance.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
So the closer.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
The closer to the left is the position of the model.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
That's the zero part.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
And then go.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
To the right is.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, long distance.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
So you can see when it's closer and closer.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
This is this.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Well, it's not, it's not mobile.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
It's the actual fuel.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
The ratio of his one is getting smaller.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Well, that's kind of a simple reason.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Because I just saw.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
This shop will.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
The power plant will do this.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
The value of this github has to do with.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
So if you're getting closer and closer.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
If you're far away, you're getting smaller and smaller.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
You're going to send it.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Then you're going to blow up your system.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
So it becomes that when you're getting closer and closer.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
What about this city tower?

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
It's going to be close to zero.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
That's how the system is going to be.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Yeah, that's the most basic reason.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
So you can predict that he's somewhere.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
This action, his size, he's somewhere.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
To reduce.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah, that's the reduction.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
The location is probably.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
Roughly in this part.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
That's probably.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
That's the one on the video.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
The following definition.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Well, you don't really need to know this definition.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Why is that?

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
And then.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
So we're basically going to end this.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
The distribution of the action field near this model.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
So we're going to take it as a three-dimensional interface.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
That's the first one on the screen.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
That's what I just said.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
The action, yes.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
For example, look at this one.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
This is a x, a of x, which is action.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
And then what's behind that?

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
That's the new curve.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
This is a general way of doing long-term computing.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
This is a familiar way of writing.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Yeah.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
What about this?

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Or what about the light?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
We can go and calculate the probability of its color.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
The color of this mp2.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Okay, so it's the shape.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Uh, his.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
The result is the second line of the equation.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And then you can see that there's one in this equation.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
There's a space for this x.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
This kind of point.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
That is to say, if we just.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
We just got rid of his.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
This space is distributed.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
So it's natural to throw it into this point.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
And then you can calculate this mp2.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
And then you make the mp2 a square.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
You can calculate this.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
The three-color interface.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
And then the result is.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
The green part below, like this.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
So this is the final, final, final, final theoretical calculation.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
This is the result.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
But after this result.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
I have a question.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Okay.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
My, my, my, my, actually, my question is quite general.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
That is.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
Ok, so you, now your monopuly charge.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
And then we actually know.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Hello, the density seems to be how much.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
So you can probably know.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
It's your number density.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
This bridge hundreds of TV.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Number density.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
How much is it?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
But they're all charging each other.

53:58.000 --> 54:03.000
So.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
So they can interact with each other through dark four times.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Or the repair is, you know, which is why you put together.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
So you're not going to have a very strong constraint.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Is it from?

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
I put it in.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
I'll give you a look at this.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
In fact, the company has considered this.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Yeah, they're going to steal a black photon.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
It's going to form, it's going to form.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
What do you mean?

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
It's going to have a strong effect.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
It's going to have a very strong effect.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Of course, we have that.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
It's okay.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Yeah, okay, interesting.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Okay, thank you.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
No, I didn't say too much.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
So there is.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Good.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Anyway, it's very mathematical here.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
That's it.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
That's it.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I just finished talking about it.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
It's just more technical stuff.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Okay, so we're going to figure out the result.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
It's a three-color interface.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
I just said that time is to look at the relationship between the three-color interface and the value.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
Okay, so that's the result.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And I'm going to give you two examples here.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I'm going to pick two.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Okay, that's basically what I just did.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I just don't have that.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
This one.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Yeah, this one.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
His signature is F.A.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
And then the horizontal axis is X.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
That's the same.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
You can look at this green one.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Do you happen to have these parameters?

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Well, basically, there's no parameter that needs to be adjusted.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
For example.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Uh.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Alpha H.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
We've just been given the benchmark point.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
And then M.N. is the value of the box.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
We know that the box is about 1G.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
And then C.T.A.0 is a parameter.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
And then C.T.A.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
C.T.A.N.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
C.N. is probably some theoretical data.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Calculate it like this.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
So we don't have a lot of parameters.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
In this model.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Okay.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And then we can see the result.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
So we're the same.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
The horizontal axis is F.A.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
And then the horizontal axis is X.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
And then we pick two benchmark points.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
And then the red and green on the graph.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
There's already a time limit.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
So I'm going to use the first one.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
I'm going to use the first one.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
And then the blue one is going to be in the future.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
It's Pico 500.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
It's the same.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
It's the same.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
It's the time of a dark matter.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
It's going to be measured in the future.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
That's it.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
So you can see that this is about the size of F.A.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
It's about 10 to the 7th square.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
That's it.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
Okay, so it's almost time.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
It's about to upgrade.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Just a little bit about this.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
It's pretty simple.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
It's just preparing a pro.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Uh, a pro.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Or some experiments are done with Electron.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
And then he's using Proton.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
And then he's going to turn a target.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
And then there's some reaction in this target.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
And then there's a lot of these.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Some of these rings.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
And then these rings might be able to get to a lot of.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I don't know about these unknown particles.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Maybe it's the action.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
That's the action.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
He might not be stable.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
He might be in.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
He's changed before he got to the tag.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Or to say.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
It's changing after you leave.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Yeah, well, there's a possibility that he's changing inside the tag.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
And then it might change into light.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Ah, electricity.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Ah, aim.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Then, of course, we're on the model side.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
This light will change to Hilton Photon.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Yeah, that's the one down there.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Equation is this.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
We should have to predict how many events we should see.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Yeah.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
That's the only thing I'm going to change.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
It's very simple to say.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Of course, it's a test.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
You can see the particle.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
It's like light, aim, or electricity.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Hidden Photon is invisible.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
But because there's a hidden.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Because it's a hidden Photon.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
So it's going to reduce.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Action to the probability of visible particles.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Yeah, so it's going to be.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Uh, it's going to be diluted.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
So it's going to be a little bit weaker.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
And then it's like, uh.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I'm going to show you this.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Like the one on the left.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
You'll find that.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
That Alpha H is zero.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Alpha H means there's no Hilton Photon.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
It's just.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
It's none of my business.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Constraint.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
It's black.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
The black part.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
But if you have an introduction of Hilton Photon.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Then you'll find that this.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Constraint will be.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
It's going to be weak.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
It's going to shrink.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It's going to shrink.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Because there's a new channel.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Yeah, that's Trump.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
And then the left and right is the future.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Yeah, we're the same.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Consider some of the same.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Uh, the possibility of Alpha H.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
So we just had the result of the bin.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
And then we have this.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
Uh, the result of the direct observation.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
And the result of the bin.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
So we can simply combine them together.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Okay, so this is our final result.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Of course, it's a little complicated.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But let's take a look at the picture.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Back.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
That's what the color counter is.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
That's what the back color.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Shadow part is.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
It's been excluded so far.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
That's the only white part.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
It's still allowed at the moment.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
That's about about ten to the fourth.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Uh, ten to the fifth.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And it's about ten mv.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
It's just around here.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
This is the pin.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
With this.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
With this, uh, direct measurement.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
There's an overlap.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Well, of course, we can say that in the future.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Maybe in this range.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
To detect this model.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It's still value like this.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Okay, so this is our final result.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
Okay, so I'm going to summarize it.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
Uh, our research project is simply to study.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Uh, hidden motor.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Hidden motor and.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
The nuclear, uh, through this action.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Uh, interaction.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
And then we're going to calculate its three-color interface.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
And then compare it with the experiment.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
And then I found about two.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
Two parameters space, it may be in the future.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
This dark matter experiment and this ice cream experiment.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Uh, do the test.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Okay, so this is my speech today.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Thank you all.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Okay, so now I'd like to ask you to turn on the microphone.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
So that we can hear our applause.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
So let's give it up.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Um, okay.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Does anyone have any questions?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Uh, I have a question.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
How do you decide this?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Uh, your input parameters.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Like, uh, and, uh, and, uh.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Oh, okay.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Okay.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
It's just that.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
For example, this side.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Oh, my God.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
This is.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
This one, this one.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Why is it?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That is, we can.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I just said we can estimate.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
This dark matter.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Uh, this number density.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Right?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That's what I just said on the side of the photo.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
A little bit.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Theoretical work.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Theoretically, we can estimate the number density of the dark matter.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And then we know it again.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Can we know its quality?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
This is mn.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
This is your mn times.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Your value times number density is.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Mass density.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
That mass density will tell you.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
How much of this dark matter should be in the universe?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
This one.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
How many potions?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Well, I just said at the beginning.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Dark matter.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
He should be in the universe.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Uh.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
One quarter of it.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
So it becomes you.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
You have a very strong limit.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So it's called fit.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
That one.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
This 25% of the words.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Your number.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Your alpha h and mn.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Can be fixed.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
But the result of theory.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I see.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So in this model.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Exxon is not dark matter.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
He is not.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
But I know.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I know.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
You also know that many people use.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Exxon is dark matter.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
That side.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We mainly treat Exxon as a medium.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
He will treat it as dark matter.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It can also be.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
But his contribution should be very small.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's almost negligible.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Compared to this.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Actually, I have one.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I have a similar.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
The problem is.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So, okay.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
So your halo is basically.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Or whatever.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Anyway, your.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
That one.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Dark matter is monopole.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But he will still.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Couple Exxon.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
That.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
If today.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Really in.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
For example, that kind of.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
He has a very strong magnetic field.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Then he can.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's like putting that.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Vacuum.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Exxon.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Is playing out.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
A photon can resonate.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But such an effect.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Can it happen to you?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
This model.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Just those side.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Exxon.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
That you.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Here, because I'm here.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I'm actually not relying on the photon.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It's not a general photon.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It should.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It should be said that there is a couple.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
But it should be.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Wait a minute.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Strength.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You see.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Through the general action.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
With the photon.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
That.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
That.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
That.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And then through that.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
That.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
That.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
That.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
That.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
That.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.820
That's a very strong electrical field.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.820
Then to generate exxon is not.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:53.820
To be honest.

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.820
Yes, it is.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:55.820
It's through a loop.

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.960
Then it becomes.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.880
If you give him a photon.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.880
Then it is.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.880
Then you it through a loop.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880
Then it becomes a.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.380
Uh, what is this.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.380
It's a normal photon.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.380
It's not a dark photon.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.380
Yes, that's what it is.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.380
I want to.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.380
I want to have constraint.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.380
But because of my action is.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.380
It should be very.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.380
You see, I'm actually quite heavy.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.380
Your impression.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.380
I see.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.380
So, if you do.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.380
So, because I'm actually quite heavy.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.380
So, if you do.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760
Without using.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760
Oh, so you came out.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760
It's not even.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.760
You come out.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.760
It's a super.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.760
That doesn't mean.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.760
I see I see.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.240
OK.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.240
Then everyone has a question?

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240
Why don't you consider others?

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240
Why didn't you consider others?

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240
direct.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.240
That.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.240
This article is a.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.240
Recreational learning field.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240
After the Selena Gavin memo like this.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240
Why don't you consider others?

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.240
direct.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.240
Uh, that Darkmatt'lll also have time to say.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.240
Can, can I.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.240
Everyone, see you like me.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.240
It's says I have this mother to.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.080
It's said that this fact is then.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.080
It's fixed.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.980
Spin dependent right.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.080
This is the first one.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080
Then there is.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.080
We, we, of course, pick.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.080
We, of course, pick this concentrate.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.080
The strongest is probably.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.080
I'm probably here.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.080
I'm kidding.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.080
Why spin dependent?

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.080
This, I'm a little bit missed.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080
Uh, actually, I didn't explain it.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.080
But.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.080
Let's put it this way.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.080
This is more technical.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.080
That is to say.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.080
You see this equation.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080
This is the result.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.080
If you're more familiar.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080
If you're more familiar with theory, you'll find out.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080
You find this section.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080
It's a bit of this.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080
Transfer momentum.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.080
So, if you're more familiar with the theory.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080
You'll find that this section.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.080
It's a bit of this.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.080
It's a bit of this.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.080
Transfer momentum.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.180
Transfer momentum.

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.180
What did he say?

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.180
So, anyway.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:53.380


01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.380
This momentum dependence.

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.380
Connection is generally spin level.

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:03.380
Yes, we have to consider this from the side.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.180
So, so what you mean is.

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.180
Anyway, in general.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.180
The result you calculated depends on spin level.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.280
This is not an assumption or something you can decide first.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280
Is that right?

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.280
It should be said that we have this result.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.280
We can.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.280
Obviously, this result tells you.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.280
It depends on this transfer momentum.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.280
So it depends on spin.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.280
Then we can find some.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.280
Effect operator.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.280
They.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.280
The result they calculated is also spin dependent.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.280
Then at the same time it depends on this transfer momentum.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.280
Then we use its result to confirm this parameter.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.380
But it doesn't mean that the transfer momentum has spin or something.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.380
If it is spin independent.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.380
You can also set some constraints, right?

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.380
You don't have to have spin.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.380
Because.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:05.380
Because it depends on momentum.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.380
So.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.380
Generally, spin independent seems.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.380
It should be weaker.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.380
You just said it's the next level.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.380
This is a bit like.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.380
This independent should have a leading order.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.380
Is.

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.380
What is it?

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.380
Leading order and sub-leading order.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.380
This kind of spin dependent should have very little contribution.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.380
It's kind of S-wave, P-wave.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:33.380
Very similar feeling.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.480
In fact, I have a slide.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.480
I talked about it in Dongda before.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.480
I don't want to talk about this detail.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480
Let me see.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.480
I talked about it in Dongda.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.480
You can take a look.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.480
Of course, there was more detail at that time.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.480
For example, we have to consider this.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.480
This effect operator.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.480
Then obviously you see this effect.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.480
Starting from this effect operator.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.580
Now, for example, on this screen.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.580
This Psi is the document.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.580
Then Psi n is the new curve.

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.580
Then through this effect operator.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.580
We can calculate its amplitude.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.580
Then you can see that the amplitude depends on this.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.580
This spin.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.580
For example, that sigma is polymetric.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.580
For example, this kind of thing is.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:19.580
Spin dependent.

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:20.580
Then there is the same amplitude.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.580
You can calculate its cross-section.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.580
Then someone has already done this analysis.

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.580
So basically, I just put this equation.

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.580
For example, this yellow one.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680
The final result.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.680
Then equal to the result we just calculated.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.680
Then do the comparison like this.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.680
So to be honest, we are a bit like.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.680
Use other constraints to constrain our parameters.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.680
We did not directly.

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.680
For example, you may want to do some.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.680
More complicated calculations.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.680
Because we haven't scored this cross-section yet.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.680
We still have to consider some.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.680
Neutron.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.680
Recurrence.

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.780
Recurrence.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.780
But I didn't really do a deep analysis.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.780
We just put people's results.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.780
To constrain.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.780
This is someone else's upper bound.

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.780
We can just extract it.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.780
I will ask this question because.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.780
Axiom interaction is not limited to.

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.780
Spin dependent cross-section.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.780
You can go straight to many experiments.

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.780
Measure the axiom.

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:25.780
Axiom can be absorbed.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.880
So if you just look at.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.880
The Fermi diagram.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.880
You can consider.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.880
Axiom is absorbed by your detector.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.880
So you can use xenon.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.880
Or LZ to measure.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.880
That's right.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.880
Are you measuring the axiom now?

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.880
Because you have to go through the axiom.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:53.880
To measure your monopole.

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:55.980
Right?

01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.980
Because it is a medium.

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.980
So.

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.980
So you go to your Fermi diagram.

01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.980
Your left side of the Fermi diagram.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.980
Monopole and axiom coupling.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.980
Your right side is the axiom.

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.980
Coupling with Fibre.

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.980
Any coupling between the axiom and your detector.

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.980
So basically I think.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.980
You should also have.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.980
You can use other bigger detectors to measure.

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.980
Because they have already done.

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.980
A lot of axiom measurements.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.980
But I don't know about the mass range.

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.980
Except for Bindan.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.980
If you have this theory.

01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.980
Other experiments can also do.

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.980
High energy axiom measurements.

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.980
They just don't have a good theory.

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.980
The reason is because the axiom is so high.

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.980
This high mass region.

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.980
His lifetime is very short.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080
So it can't be a dark matter.

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.080
Right.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.080
So these direct dark matter experiments.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.080
They won't consider.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.080
This kind of axiom.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080
He will only consider KEV's axiom.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080
He won't consider.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080
GEV or NEV's axiom.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080
But if you set up this model.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.080
They can consider GEV's axiom.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.080
Because your axiom is not dark matter.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.080
It's your monopole that's dark matter.

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.180
Yeah.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.180
But I don't know what you just said.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.180
Experiment.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.180
LZ can be.

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.180
Unlox or Xenon.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.180
They all have a lot of.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.180
Bosonic dark matter measurement.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.180
Basically.

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.180
Axiom in KEV to 100 KEV.

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.180
This range.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.180
You can imagine the axiom.

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.180
Detected absorbed.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.180
Just like the photon.

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.180
Then you can use this.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.280
Then you can use this to consider the axiom.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.280
That.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.280
In the KEV range.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.280
What about your model?

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.280
Basically, you can also consider the axiom.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.280
NEV or GEV range.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.280
It was absorbed by your detector.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.280
Uh-huh.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.280
Of course they may.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.280
Their detector may have energy.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.280
Threshold may not be able to GEV.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.280
Maybe a few NEV.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.280
I guess.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.280
So maybe in this.

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.380
Maybe on the left side of your picture.

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.380
This place can be set up.

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.380
Uplimit.

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.380
Are you on the left side of the picture?

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.380
There are many NEV parts.

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.380
This is about 10 NEV range.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.380
But there are other things here.

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.380
I didn't just say that.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.380
Yes, there may be other things.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.380
So I don't know.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.380
Is it other.

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.380
These large dark matter experiments.

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.380
Can also be done.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480
What about the region on the left side of your picture?

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.480
Because I don't know.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.480
Where is their energy threshold?

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.480
I am doing low mass.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.480
But.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.480
But I look at this picture.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.480
I think it's actually a bit like.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.480
High mass experiment.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480
Want to do low mass.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.480
The place is probably on the right.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.480
They can do a few GEV now.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.480
Then do a low mass.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480
Just do it.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.480
So in fact, I think this one.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.580
A lot of people want to.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.580
There are a lot of direct experiments.

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.580
You are not the same.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.580
This is Exxon, not WIMP.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.580
WIMP in GEV is low mass.

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.580
But in Exxon, GEV is high mass.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.580
No, I'm talking about it now.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.580
In general, if you can.

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.580
For example, you can couple to a.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.580
U1 Bosonic dark matter.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.580
So it actually includes this side.

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.580
So I think it can.

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.580
For example, if today.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.680
They consider.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.680
You can be in Xenon.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.680
For example.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.680
Analyzation signal.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.680
Direct absorption.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.680
They should be able to do 0.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.680
It's 10 to 0 to 10 to 1.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.680
If today is.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.680
If it's a solid detector.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.680
I think I can do it again.

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.680
So in fact, this picture is a big piece.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.680
There should be data to look at.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.680
So it's possible to see.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.680
So you might have new concerns here.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.780
If you consider those.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.780
Giant dark matter experiment.

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.780
I'll take a look.

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.780
Tell me about it later.

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.780
I'm actually doing a little analysis here.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:24.780
Because we're doing Marana now.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.780
We're thinking about whether we can do this.

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:28.780
NEV Exxon experiment.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.780
Measurement.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880
Because in general.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880
Exxon in NEV.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.880
Lifetime is very short.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.880
So Exxon can't be dark matter.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.880
But if you are.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.880
There is a dark sector.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.880
Or a forever thing.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.880
Through Exxon couple to your detector.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.880
Then you.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.880
Exxon's lifetime can be very short.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.880
So in theory, you can set a constraint there.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.980
That's it.

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:02.980
Sorry.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.980
Do you have any other questions?

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.980
I think we.

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.980
If you want to discuss it later.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.980
But do you have any other questions?

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.980
If not.

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.980
Let's applaud again.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.980
Thank you.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.980
Thank you all.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.980
That's it for today.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.080
That's it for today.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.080
That's it for today.
