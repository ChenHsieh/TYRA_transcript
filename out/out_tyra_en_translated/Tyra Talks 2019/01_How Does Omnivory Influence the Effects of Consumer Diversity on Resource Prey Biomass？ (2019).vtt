00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Thank you very much today, Zhang Fengxun, PhD candidate, can give us an online speech.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
I am the host, Zhou Zhiqian, who is currently working at MD Anderson as a postdoc.

00:17.000 --> 00:28.000
Let me introduce you a little bit about Zhang Fengxun's current education experience.

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
In 2009, Zhang Fengxun obtained his master's degree from the Department of Insectology at NTU.

00:39.000 --> 00:51.000
In 2013, he obtained his master's degree from the Department of Ecology and Biochemistry at NTU.

00:51.000 --> 01:06.000
Then, he spent a year at UC California Berkeley as a visiting student researcher at the Department of Environmental Science Policy and Management.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Then, he transferred to the University of Michigan to obtain his doctorate.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
His major is the School of Nature Research and Environmental.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Now, he is already a PhD candidate.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
We are very honored to invite him to give us an online speech.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
The topic of his speech today is

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
How does Ominary influence the effects of consumer diversity on research prey consumption?

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Now, let's invite Zhang Fengxun to give us a speech. Thank you.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Thank you for the host's introduction.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Thank you.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
The topic of my speech today is mainly a framework for my PhD thesis.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
And the results I have made recently.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
It's almost done, so I hope I can get some feedback from everyone.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
My overarching question is

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
How does Ominary influence the effects of consumer diversity on research prey consumption?

02:24.000 --> 02:36.000
How many resources are consumed by different consumers?

02:36.000 --> 02:46.000
Before answering this question, I would like to briefly explain to everyone that the topic I have made is

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
The question I want to answer in this subfield is

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
How does Ominary influence the functions of the entire system?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
These functions are shown in this picture.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
How many resources are consumed?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
How many biomass are produced?

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
How are these functions influenced by the number of organisms in the system?

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
After many years of research,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
we all think that

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
when there are more organisms in the system,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
the function of the system will be higher and higher.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
This is because different species have to live together at the same time.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
They have to use different resources.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
If the food I eat is different from the food you eat, we can live in harmony.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
This is the concept of resource partitioning.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
If it is a picture, you can look at it.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Assuming that the different X-axis on the right is a different resource.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
For example, temperature or different pH of the soil.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
The white circle in the middle is the resources needed by different organisms.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
If different organisms occupy different resources,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
they can live in harmony.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
In addition to living in harmony, they can also use these resources more efficiently.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
This is our consensus in the BEF subfield.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
But there is a problem.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
There are more than three-quarters of the research in this subfield.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It's all experimented with plants.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
For example, in the picture on the left,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
how many plants are there in the grass?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
How many different kinds of grass?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
How many organisms are there?

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
If it's in the animal community,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
will we find the same thing?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
The answer is,

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
Generally, we think that when the consumer diversity increases,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
the ecosystem function should also increase.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
But the pattern, the signal,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
is not as obvious as in the plant community.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
For example, in 2013, the Meta-Analysis

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
reported that it reviewed more than 40 studies.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
More than half of them said that we did not see a positive correlation.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
In other words, diversity does not have a positive impact on the function.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
More than half of them said that we did not see a positive impact.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
At this time, we will ask,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
why is it like this?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Is it because animals and plants are different?

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Don't they need to partition their resources to coexist?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Or are there other factors?

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
They don't need to partition to coexist.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
This hypothesis is basically invalid.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Because it is impossible for two societies to use the same thing

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
and live well together.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
It should be said that this case is very rare.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
For example, in this study,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
it is a very famous study.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It is in the seaweed bed.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
The picture on the left is the seaweed bed in the sea.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
There are different grazers on the seaweed bed.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
You can think of it as different little prawns, little worms.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
They will eat these seaweed.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
They will also eat the algae on the seaweed.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
As you can see,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
when we have more grazers,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
the overall biomass of the grazer can grow more.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
We can also eat less algae.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
For example, we still see diversity in the consumer community.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It has a positive impact on the function.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Especially the consumption of resources has a positive impact.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
They also reported that

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
they saw this positive impact

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
because different grazers

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
tend to stay in different parts of the seaweed.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
For example, this grazer will be in a shorter place.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
This grazer will be in a straight place.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
So they actually use different spaces.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
In other words, they really use different resources.

07:00.000 --> 07:11.000
So resource partitioning has a positive impact on diversity and function.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
In other words, resource partitioning has a positive impact on function.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
There is no problem.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
But in fact, there are many experiments.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
They said that animals not only eat the seaweed below.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Many animals actually eat other animals.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
In other words, like humans,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
we don't just eat plants.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We don't just eat meat.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
We eat everything.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
We are solid.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
In other words, this meta-analysis

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
in the report of 2007,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
it is a review of many food webs.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Many grazers measure their stomach content.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
It really depends on what they eat.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
They found that the vast majority of animals

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
are omnivores.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
They are all solid.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
The simplest example of a solid omnivore

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
is when we have a very simple food web.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Suppose there are only four species.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
With two animals.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
The simplest is called Intra-Cultivated.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
For example, there is an animal that only eats

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
the resource below its stomach.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
These species.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
But there is another animal.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
In addition to eating these resources,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
it also ate the species that just ate the resource.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
So this feeding link is the simplest omnivore.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
So this is Intra-Cultivated IGP.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
The simplest example of an omnivore.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
When the omnivore occurs,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
or when the Intra-Cultivated IGP occurs,

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
many studies have told us

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
that it will reduce the entire consumer function.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
For example, in this study,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Grasshopper in this study.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What is this called?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
What is it called?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Tooth bug.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
No.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
An insect that only eats grass.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I forgot what it's called in Chinese.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It's a pest.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Then it puts this pest

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
together with many other different animals.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
See if these animals can eat this pest.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
So in this experiment,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
if there is no pest,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
nothing,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
only Grasshopper alone,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
it can grow so much.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But if there are some pests,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
some other consumers,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
it only eats this grasshopper,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
it can eat it very low,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
almost none.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But if I put a lot of species in,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
because these animals will eat each other

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
and eat each other,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
so they eat less grasshopper overall.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
In other words,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
when the omnivore occurs,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
or intragural predation,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
a simple case occurs,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
we will see that

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
consumer diversity

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
has a negative effect on the function.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So we can draw

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
a very simple memory map.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
When resource partitioning occurs,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
the consumer function will increase.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But when intragural predation occurs,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
this function will decrease.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Consumer diversity

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
will have a negative effect on the function.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
So in order to study

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
who is more important,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I asked a question.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
My Ph.D.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
The main question I want to answer is

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
resource partitioning

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
and omnivore,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
these two things,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
these two forces,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
who is more important

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
to determine

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
animal diversity

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
and pre-consumption.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
I have four ways

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
to answer this big question.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
The first is

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
because I don't know

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
how omnivore,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I know it's probably negative,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
but I don't know

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
how strong it is

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
to eliminate the benefits

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
of resource partitioning.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
So I need to have a hypothesis first.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
So the first step

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
is to make a mathematical model,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
a theoretical model,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
to help me

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
generate a hypothesis.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I can continue to do experiments later.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
The second step is

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I have a small experiment

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
in the lab

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
to verify that

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
the mathematical model

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
can really be discovered

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
in a biological object,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
not just a mathematical calculation.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Then it seems like

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I see something like this.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
The next step is

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
because it was all in math just now,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
it was all on paper,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
or it was all just

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
in this kind of

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
well-controlled environment

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
in the lab.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So the third step is

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I think the most important part

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
of this paper is

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
that I want to be able to

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
discover or not discover

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
this theory or experiment

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
in the wild.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
This is how I can tell people

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
whether this is important or not.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Is this thing

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
important or not?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
So the first step

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
is to make a mathematical model.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
This mathematical model

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
is actually very simple.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I believe you all understand.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It's just a very simple

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
four ordinary differential equations

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
to describe the change in time

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
in a group.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Here we see P1 and P2

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
are the densities of a certain species,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
or biomass.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
The first one is that

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
their population growth rate

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
will follow this function.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Then this function

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
is actually a logistic regression,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
but we don't have to understand it too much.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Anyway, it will grow.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
There are two reasons for P1 and P2.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
It will grow.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Then there are two zoomers,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
which are two animals.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
They will eat these two resources.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Z1 and Z2 will eat P1 and P2.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Then their consumption term

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
is described as their mathematical value.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Then here is a more important point.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I put a parameter S.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
I use S to adjust

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
how much Z1 and Z2

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
are partitioned

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
or not partitioned.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
So for example,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
if Z1 is 1,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
if S1 is 1,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Z1 will eat P2 completely,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
but it doesn't eat P1 at all.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
If S2 is 1,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Z2 will eat P1 completely,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and Z2 doesn't eat P2 at all.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Or in other words,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
if Z1 or Z2 is 0.5,

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
if S1 or S2 is 0.5,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Z1 and Z2

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
will completely overlap their resources.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
That is, half of their P1 and P2.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Next,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
one of the consumers,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Z1, will be eaten by Z2.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I just described the simplest

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
example of an omnivore,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
which is inter-game partition.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Z1 will be eaten by Z2.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So after having this model,

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
I can see these two parameters,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
S1 and S2,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
which will affect

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
how many resources are eaten overall.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I won't go into

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
the details of how to analyze this model.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It's just a process

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
of writing ODE.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Then,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
the most important contribution

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
of this model is

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
to generate this hypothesis.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
In other words,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
when these two species

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
are in this state,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
the overall resource density

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
will increase

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
with the intra-game partition,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
which is the alpha just now,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
and then decrease and then increase.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
In other words,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
this partition is completely different

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
from the intra-game partition

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
we thought at the beginning

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
or the omnivore

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
which will have a negative effect

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
on the consumer function.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
It will eat more resources

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
when the omnivore is weak,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
and then eat fewer resources

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
when the omnivore is strong.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That's why we see

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
this concave-up function.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
This pattern is

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
no matter how high

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
or low my resource partition is,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I can see this function

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
going up and down.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
For example, the intra-game partition

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
will let the consumer eat more resources

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
than the omnivore.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Now we have a hypothesis.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
We are going to see

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
whether this math tells me

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
whether this pattern can be observed

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
on a real organism.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
So I did a little experiment.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The first one is

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
my resource has

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
a bunch of bacteria.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
These three are different bacteria.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Then there is

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
the first consumer,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
which is the intra-game partition.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
The first one only eats bacteria.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The second one

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
is the consumer

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
that eats bacteria at the same time

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
and eats

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
the other

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
consumer species.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
So this is the

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
mathematical model

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
of the real organism.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I can't control

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
whether I want this one to eat more

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
or less,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
so I have to adjust

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
or manipulate the

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
intra-game partition strength.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
The method I use is

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
to take a net

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and let the small

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
intra-game partition

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
that only eats bacteria

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
run around.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
However, the big one

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
will be limited

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
to the small one

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
if it is observed.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Then I use this net

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
to adjust

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
the position

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
in the bottle

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
of the experiment.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I can adjust

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
how many

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
consumers

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
will be exposed

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
to the risk of being eaten by the big one,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
which is how high

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
or how close

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
their contact probability is.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
If this net

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
is placed in the middle

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
of the intra-game partition,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
then the

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
big one is less than the small one.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
But if this net is

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
only about 20%

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
of the space

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
for the big one

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
to move,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
then the intra-game partition strength

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
is 20.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
The above picture

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
shows that I cut off

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
the bottom of the glass bottle

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
and glued the net in

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
to make an experiment

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
jar.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
After this

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
is done,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I can test this hypothesis.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I want to see

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
if the density of

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
the bacteria

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
increases

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
with the

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
intra-game partition strength

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
and decreases

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
with the contact probability.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
After the experiment,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
we can see

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
that there is a

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
concave fob.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
When the intra-game partition

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
increases,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
when the resource density

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
reaches an equilibrium,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
when the population

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
does not change too much,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
the bacteria density

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
will decrease first.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Next,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I want to explain

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
whether this pattern is

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
true or not,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and whether the mechanism

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
is like my mathematical model.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
If I put the mathematical model

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
on this experimental result,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
you will find that

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
this black dot is

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
the result of the experiment.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
This curve is the density

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
predicted by the mathematical model.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
You will find that they are quite different.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
This curve and

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
these black dots

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
hardly explain anything.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
They just have a concave fob function.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
This pattern is qualitatively

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
correct, but

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
quantitatively is

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
not accurate at all.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I can't use my model to explain

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
the result I saw in the lab.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
There is a very important reason

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
why I can't use

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
my model.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
When I describe the intra-game partition,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I use a type 1 functional response.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
This type 1 functional response

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
means that

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
no matter how many prey

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
come to me,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I will eat them.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
This is actually

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
unrealistic.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
How can we keep eating

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
and eating and eating?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Its function is a linear

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
upward. This is not a reasonable

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
state.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I don't want to use this function.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I changed it to a more complex

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
non-linear function.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
It will have a sense of satiety

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
when it eats.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Even if a bunch of food

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
comes, it will not

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
continue to eat more.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
This is called type 2 functional response.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It looks like this.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
When I change this

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
functional response from type 1 to type 2,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
my model prediction

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
will be closer to

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
the result of the lab.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Although it is not

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
exactly the same,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
the explanation

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
can explain

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
about 70% of the variation.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Mainly these two points.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
The lab observed that

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
it was low enough.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I don't know why the model can't

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
be so low.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Almost 70%

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
of the explanation power

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
is quite satisfactory.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
We can use

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
this model that has been changed

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
to explain

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
what really happened

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
in the real organism.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
The model of type 2 functional response

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
that has been changed

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
can not only explain

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
bacterial density,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
but also explain

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
the density of

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
the other two consumers,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Intragalepra and Praetor.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It also explains about 70%.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
The prediction function

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
is very similar.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
We can use this model

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
to explain what really happened

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
in the organism.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
As I said,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
it is type 2 functional response.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
When there is a little bit of

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Intragalepra

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
and Praetor,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
when there is a little bit of

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Praetor,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
the Praetor

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
is more nutritious

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
than the bacteria.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
We can't see the bacteria.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
The Praetor is bigger

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
and more nutritious.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
For example,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
if we eat a little bit of

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
meat,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
in theory,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
we will grow bigger and healthier.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Although there are vegetarians,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
if we eat a little bit of meat,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
a little bit of food,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
we will grow more.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
We can see that

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Intragalepra and Praetor

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
really grow bigger

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
and eat a little bit.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
So,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
when there are a lot of big Praetor

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
and

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
a few small Praetor,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
they can eat

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
more bacteria

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
overall.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
However,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
when the Intragalepra

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
is very strong,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
the big Praetor will be full.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
As I said,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
the big Praetor

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
will be full.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
When I eat a certain amount of food,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I won't eat

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
more food

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
because I am full.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
So, when the big Praetor

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
is full,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
it doesn't eat bacteria.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
It doesn't need to eat bacteria.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
The small Intragalepra

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
is eaten by the big Praetor.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
The small Praetor is getting smaller.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
The big Praetor doesn't change much.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
So,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
when the two Praetors

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
are eating each other,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
the bacteria are very happy

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
because no one eats them.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
So, the biological mechanism

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
behind this

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
is like this.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Because

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
there is

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
a satiated

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
functional response,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
we can see that

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
weak Intragalepra

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
will increase overall consumption

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
and decrease overall consumption.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
That is to say, it will reduce

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
the basal resource density first and then increase.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
This is

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
what the lab

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
and math tell us.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
This thing may happen.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
But

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
in the paper ice

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
and in the lab's

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
good and perfect environment,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
will this result happen

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
in the wild?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Will you see

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
the positive impact of resource partitioning?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Intragalepra will be positive first.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
When it is very weak, it is positive first.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Then negative again.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Will you see this?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
So I

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
need to use

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
more real data

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
to do this reality check.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
So what I want to check

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
is that I need to know

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
the resource consumption

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
or

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
resource community biomass

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
will it really decrease

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
with the increase of consumer diversity?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
That is to say, when I have

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
a lot of different animals

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
or different kinds of consumers,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
will they really eat more

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
of their prey?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Will this

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
impact

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
when these consumers

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
eat each other

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
not so seriously,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
but not so seriously,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
will this impact increase?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And when people eat each other

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
and it gets more and more exaggerated,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
will this impact decrease?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
This is what I want to test in the end.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
You can't see this pattern in the wild.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
So my

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
first method is

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I went to

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
find a big

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
data set. This data set

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
is the EPA in the United States.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Every

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
five years,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
they will

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
go to every lake in the United States,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
every state, every place, every lake.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
He went to do a sample.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Then

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
after choosing more than 1,000 lakes,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
he will measure how many kinds of

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
phytoplankton in this lake,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
which is the basic

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
resource in the lake.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
They are food. How many

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
different kinds of phytoplankton do they have?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
How many kinds of phytoplankton are there?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
How much biomass is there in total?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Next is their

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
predator.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
This is the first

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
consumer in the entire lake.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
It will eat

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
those small creatures

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
like phytoplankton.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It will also measure

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
how many of them are

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
diverse in density.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Then

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
in this data set,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
the only pity is

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
that he didn't really measure

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
whether the

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
omelette is strong or weak.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
He didn't do an experiment

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
to measure how many

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
phytoplankton or how many small

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
consumers are eaten by large consumers.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
He didn't measure this thing.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Because there are too many lakes, he can't do so many experiments.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
But he reported that

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
he saw this phytoplankton,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
this consumer,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
it will eat other consumers

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
or not.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Is it vegetarian, meat-eating,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
it is solid.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
So I use

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
this low plankton community

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
how many are

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
omnivore

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
as a

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
degree of omnivore proxy.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
This is not very good, but it is

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
in this data

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
you can get

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
evidence

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
information.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Then there are other

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
water temperature, pH,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
electricity,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
other data.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
So after having this big data,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I will test

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
this hypothesis.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
The first is to look at

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
the relationship between resource consumption and consumer diversity.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Will this relationship

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
increase or decrease

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
with the omnivore?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Before I actually did this experiment,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
in fact, three years ago,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
someone had used this data

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
to do a very preliminary

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
and basic analysis.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
He just put the

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
resource community of biomass,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
how many resources are there,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
to return to other factors.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Then I found

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
how many kinds of

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
resource diversity

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and the

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
egg and phosphorus in the lake.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
These three are the most important

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
effects of phytoplankton

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
biomass.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
However,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
as I just said,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
this data set

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
comes from the whole of the United States.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
In other words,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
the lake in California and the lake in Michigan

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
will definitely look different.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
But when they did this analysis,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
they did not consider this matter.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
He treats everything as the same.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
So what he wants to see is an overall overview.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
So in fact, there are a lot of

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
biological interactions

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
in the middle that

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
will be ignored.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
So to test this,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
to do my analysis,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I have to make their analysis

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
more complicated.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
The so-called more complicated

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
is the first one,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
because these lakes belong to

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
different regions,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
belong to different ecoregions.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Everyone can think of ecoregions as

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
different ecoregions,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
it means that there are different

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
large-scale biological,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
chemical, geological,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and water-temperature historical factors

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
that cause this lake to be

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
fundamentally different.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
So my first step

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
is to make this model

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
more complicated.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I added special heterogeneity

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
to this model.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
In other words,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
the model just now

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
estimates only one effect,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
that is,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
biodiversity.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Only one value will affect

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
the community biomass.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
But now I make this effect

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
depend on different ecoregions.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
In other words, I can make it

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
have different effects

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
in different ecoregions.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
So maybe in California,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
this is very strong,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
but in Michigan, this may be very low.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I consider this randomness.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
This is the first

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
complexity.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
The second is

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I really want to test my prediction.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I added open-ended speech richness.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And I made this effect

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
depend on another variable.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
In other words,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
this is a general return,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
y equals ax plus b.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I just need to look at

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
how big or how small ax's a is.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I know what the impact of x on y is.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
This is the most basic return.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
But I don't want it now.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Community biomass equals

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
a factor called beta

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
multiplied by

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
open-ended diversity.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
But this beta is

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
another response variable.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
So this is the second hierarchy.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
In other words,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
my model is

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
not a plane.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
It has many layers.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
When it becomes many layers,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
the original analysis method

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
can't handle this complexity.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
So what I have to do is

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Bayesian hierarchical model.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I didn't go into too much detail

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
about how to do Bayesian.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
In short,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
what I want to answer is

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
even if I measure this big data,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
when I see the probability of

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
this effect,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
and when I see

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
the effect of one variable

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
on the other variable,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
what is the probability?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
The data

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
is like I just said,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
it will be measured every five years.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
The last two years are 2007 and 2012.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
In 2007,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I did

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
a full model.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I will do some model selection

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
to remove this

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
to see if it has

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
a higher or lower

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
ability to explain this model.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Or the probability is higher or lower.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
After doing the model selection,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
finally,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
in 2007,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
the best model is

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
the three variables just now.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
They are all selected.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Specialty, Trojanity

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
are very important.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Let these effects depend on

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
special ecoregion.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
And I also chose

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
another variable.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
This picture shows

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
the posterior I just mentioned.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Even this data,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I see

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
what is the probability

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
of the effect of this variable.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
That is the posterior probability.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
So we can see

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
the three most important variables

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
are still selected.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
But these three variables

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
are not a value anymore.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
They come from a distribution.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Give me an ecoregion,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I can tell you

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
what the effect of these three variables

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
in that ecoregion will be.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Then there is a

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
very awkward position,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
which is

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Zofan's Diversity.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It seems to be important,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
but it doesn't seem to be.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
If you add it in,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
you can increase

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
the model's posterior probability.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You can also increase

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
the model's ability to explain

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
or even predict.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
But its credible interval

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
overlaps with 0.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
In terms of statistics,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
this is the story of 2007.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But by 2012,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
this model has changed.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
This model adds

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Zofan's Diversity.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Zofan's Diversity is

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
an important variable

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
in the data of 2002.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It can help explain

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
the variable of Zofan's Community.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And this effect depends on

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Omnivory.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
But there is another awkward situation.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Although it depends on Omnivory,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
adding it in

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
is helpful to this model.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
But the effect of Omnivory

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
cannot be detected.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Just like

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
the awkward effect of

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Zofan in 2007.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Adding it in is useful,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
but I can't know

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
how much it is.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
But overall,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
these three variables are the most important.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Adding Special Issue Genuity

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
is also very helpful to this model.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Hello.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Can you hear me?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Hello.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I missed the first five minutes.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Can we interrupt you

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
to ask a question?

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Or do we have to ask at the end?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It's okay.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I have a question.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Because

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
these variables are

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
actually meaningful variables.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Like Total Nitrogen,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Total blah blah blah,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
have you ever considered

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
combining these variables?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
For example,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
finding an eigenvalue

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
or linear combination.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I can do that.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
But if I

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
find its eigenvalue,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I will still lose

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
correlation.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Secondly,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
the correlation between these variables

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
is not very big.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
So I will just

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
treat each variable as an eigenvalue.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Oh.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Makes sense.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Yeah.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Nitrogen and Phosphorus.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
This is a good question.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Nitrogen and Phosphorus

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
are highly correlated.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
So in the model,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I let these two things

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I put their covariance matrix

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
in the model,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
but I didn't draw it directly.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Oh, I see. Thank you.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Hi.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Oh, I almost forgot.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
So,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
in 2007 and 2012,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
in 2007 and 2012,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
the models we saw

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
were different.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Given 2007 and given 2012,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
the most likely

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
explanation of these data

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
was different.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
As time goes by,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I might see that

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
these variables are not important.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
But how did they change?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Even this data,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
because I only have two

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
snapshots,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and they are so far apart.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I don't know how they changed.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
But there is one thing

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I can point out.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
In 2007,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
the local diversity

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
was awkward.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
It was on the edge.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
But in 2012,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
it was really

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
different from 0.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
So,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
when I dug up

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
these raw data,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I found that in 2012,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
on average,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
every lake had 8 different

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
low content.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Compared to 2007,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I don't know how this happened.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But if this happened,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
it means that in 2012,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
in recent years,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
there are more animals

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
moving around.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
With more animals,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
it's easier to see that

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
different animals eat different foods.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Or they have a different impact

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
on the biomass of low content.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
For example,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
the effect of this variable

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
is easier to detect.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
But in 2012,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
in 2007 and 2012,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I can explain that

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
low content diversity

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
can be detected.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
But other variables,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
like Omnivore,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
why it wasn't detected

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
in 2007 and 2012,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I don't really understand.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
They are basically the same.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
A lot of Omnivores are the same.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But in 2012,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
it was detected.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
In 2007, it wasn't.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Given this data,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
I can't answer this question.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Lastly,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
this is

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
the biggest problem

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
of Shrubster.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
As I said,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
the degree of Omnivore

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
is not measured.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
It doesn't measure how many small animals

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
are eaten,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
or how many overboars

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
are eaten by

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
plants and animals.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
It's not measured.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
It's a proxy.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It's hard to verify

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
because

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
it's a proxy.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I can't detect

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
the Omnivore.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Maybe it's because

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Omnivore is too

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
unimportant.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Only in math,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
or in a

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
well-controlled environment,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I can see this effect.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
So when I go out,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
it's not important.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
It won't happen.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
My PhD will know what I'm doing.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
It's a sad

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
conclusion.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
However,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
to solve the Omnivore

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
consumption problem,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I have another

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
experiment.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I go to the lake

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
to get water

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
to feed these animals.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I measure

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
how many phytoplankton

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
are eaten by

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
small animals

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
and how many by large animals.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Overall,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
how many phytoplankton

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
are eaten.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I can measure

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
the consumption

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
of phytoplankton.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It's the most important

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
response variable.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
How is it affected by

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
zooplankton diversity?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
How is this effect

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
strengthened by Omnivore?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
In the experiment,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I measured

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
these things.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
However,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
it took too much energy.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I can only get

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
30 points.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I spent two summers

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
to get 30 points.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Let me show you

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
my experiment.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
put a

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
boat on the

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
lake.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I drove the boat to the lake

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
to get water.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
After I got water,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I put it back in the bottle.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
There are animals

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
and plants in the bottle.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I left it in the lake

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
for a day.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I checked

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
how many animals and plants

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
disappeared.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
However,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
the first result

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
disappeared.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
So I skipped it.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I can

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
share the results

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
with you later.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Let me show you

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
the animals

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
in the experiment.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Microzooplankton

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
look like

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
dinoflagellates.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
There are also

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
small ciliates

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
in the experiment.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
There are also large ciliates.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
That's all for today.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
In theory,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
this experiment

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
is promising.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
However, it is too labor intensive.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I can't

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
get a good result

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
from this experiment.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
The sample size is too small.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I skip

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
the experiment result.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I will share

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
the results with you later.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Thank you

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
for your attention.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I will leave

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
my email address

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
at the end of the video.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
If you have any questions

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
or suggestions,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
please

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
leave a message.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Thank you.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Thank you.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Thank you.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Thank you,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
for the wonderful

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
presentation.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Let's see if anyone

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
has any questions

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
about

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Microzooplankton.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Let me ask a

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
naive question.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
All your research

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
focuses on

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
phytoplankton

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
and zooplankton.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Can zooplankton

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
be applied

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
to larger

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
subspecies?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Large subspecies

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
are fine.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I can't

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
answer

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
this question

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
confidently.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
I can't scale up

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
to larger animals.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It's complicated.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
For example,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
humans or

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
cats and dogs

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
are harder to

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
quantify

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
than

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
small animals.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
It's hard to

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
systematically collect

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
data.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I'm not sure

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
if I can

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
scale up to

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
large animals.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
If there's a system

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
that can measure

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
zooplankton and

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
consumer diversity,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
this system

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
can be applied

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
to my framework

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
to see if

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
different systems

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
have different

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
effects.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Let me follow up

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
with a question.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Zooplankton

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
doesn't look

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
complicated.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
It's just

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
eating and being eaten.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I'm thinking

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
that

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
when zooplankton

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
eats

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
phytoplankton

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
and is

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
being eaten,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
doesn't it have

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
mechanisms

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
that make

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
zooplankton

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
eat phytoplankton?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm not sure

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
if I can

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
scale up to

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
large animals.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I'm not sure

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
if I can

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
scale up to

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
zooplankton

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
and eat

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
phytoplankton.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I'm not sure

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
if I can

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
scale up to

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
large animals.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I'm not sure

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
if I can

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
scale up to

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
zooplankton

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
and eat

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
phytoplankton.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm not sure

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
if I can

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
scale up to

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
large animals.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I'm not sure

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
if I can

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
scale up to

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
zooplankton

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
and eat

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
phytoplankton.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I'm not sure

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
if I can

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
scale up to

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
large animals.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I'm not sure

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
if I can

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
scale up to

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
large animals.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I'm not sure

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
if I can

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
scale up to

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
large animals.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And if I can

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
scale up to

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
a whole family.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
If I can

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
scale up to

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
a whole family.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And if I can

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
scale up to

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
a whole family.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Because I'm not sure

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
if I can

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
scale up to

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
a whole family.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Because I'm not sure

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
if I can scale up

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
to a whole family.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Maybe the analysis

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
can help someone.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Maybe the analysis

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
can help someone.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Because

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I live in a small nature.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
And my house

47:11.000 --> 47:12.360
has withrawn

47:12.360 --> 47:14.000
years ago.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
So if

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I do the analysis

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I can scale up

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
to a whole family.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
For example,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
a pond can count

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
tens of thousands

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
of plants.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
tens of thousands

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
of individuals.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
And animals

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
can count hundreds of thousands of individuals.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
So the distribution

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
of variables

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
is actually

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
systematically dominant

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
but not statistically dominant.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Statistically uncertainty dominant.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I think so.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
I don't understand

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
what you mean.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
What I mean is

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
the number of

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
animals you count

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
is so large

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
that

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
there is no calculation

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
error.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
The distribution width

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
mainly comes from

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
the difference in region

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
and year, right?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Yes.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
We believe so.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
For example,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
the species

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
of phytoplankton.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I do one thing.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I verify

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
the species

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
of phytoplankton.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
How to say?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I don't count

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
the number of species.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I consider

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
all samples

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
given sampling effort.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I can draw a curve.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Sampling effort

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
is x-axis.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Y-axis is species richness.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Given a sampling effort,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I can estimate

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
how many species

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
the sampling effort should have.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
This curve

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
is calculated

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
from all data.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
So

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I assume

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
my sampling is

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
representative

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
to that lake.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I can't verify this.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
But I count a lot.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
This assumption should be possible.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I also consider

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
the sampling effort.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I don't count

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
the number of species.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I count a lot

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
and get a lot of species.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
I count a little and get a little species.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
I see.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Thank you.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Let me explain

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
why I ask this question.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
A while ago,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I went to see

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
a group of researchers.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
They were doing

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
microscopic sampling.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
They said

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
it was hard

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
to calculate

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
the number of species

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
with human eyes.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
If you know

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
the statistical error,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
you can calculate

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
the number of species.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
They developed a

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
video recognition method

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
to calculate

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
the number of species.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
They immediately reduced

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
the error.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I was wondering

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
if you could apply this technology.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
You said you counted

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
tens of thousands of species.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
The statistical error of tens of thousands

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
is about 1%.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
The width of the distribution

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
is more than 1%.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
This means

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
the dominant bias

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
is different by region

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
and year.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
It doesn't help you much.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I was wondering

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
if we could apply

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
a better method

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
of sampling.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
You said

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
this method

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
was like

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
a machine

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
doing it for me.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
If I look at it

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
with my eyes,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I need to look at

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
1 liter of water.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
But this machine

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
is like a microscope

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
taking photos of me.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
It keeps taking photos.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I can adjust the flow rate

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
and how fast or slow it is.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It's a bit like

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
the technique you mentioned.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
This software is a bit like

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
the technique you mentioned.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
It helps me expand my sample size.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Okay.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
That makes sense.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
The problem I encountered

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
in this field

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
is that

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I can build

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
these curves

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
and detect these signals.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
I have more than 1,000 data.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
But when I

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
need to measure these feeding needs,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
because I'm alone,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I can only measure

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
up to 40 data points.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
The problem I encountered

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
is that the machine exists,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
but the distribution

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
is zero.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
So

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
it's a lot of trouble.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I see. So you really need

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
a lot of statistics.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I'm willing to

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
do research

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
in the wild.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I see. Thank you.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Thank you.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Any other

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
questions?

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
If not,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
let's give a round of applause

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
to thank Zhang Fengxun

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
for his wonderful presentation.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Thank you.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Thank you, everyone.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
This is the end of

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
the webinar.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
The video will be uploaded

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
next week.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
If you are interested

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
in more details,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
or would like to contact

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Zhang Fengxun

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
for a more in-depth discussion,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
please do so.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Thank you.
