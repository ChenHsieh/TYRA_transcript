0	2000	You can see it.
2000	4000	Okay, I'll start.
4000	6000	You know my name,
6000	8000	my name is Wang Zhu Yi.
8000	10000	The easier way to remember is
10000	12000	the sound of Zhu Yi and the chair made by Zhu.
12000	14000	I graduated from
14000	16000	the University of South California
16000	18000	last year
18000	20000	with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering.
20000	22000	Today, I want to talk about
22000	24000	something related to my thesis
24000	26000	and my current research.
26000	28000	We have a framework
28000	30000	called Innovative Design Thinking.
30000	32000	It guides
32000	34000	designers
34000	36000	on how to design.
36000	38000	Today, I'll focus on
38000	40000	conceptual design.
42000	44000	I'll introduce
44000	46000	its background.
46000	48000	Conceptual design
48000	50000	has two phases.
50000	52000	One is concept generation,
52000	54000	the other is concept improvement.
54000	56000	I'll talk about it.
56000	58000	First,
58000	60000	I'll briefly introduce
60000	62000	my background.
62000	64000	Then, I'll talk about
64000	66000	some of the main
66000	68000	terms we're talking about
68000	70000	and what they are.
70000	72000	This is how I write
72000	74000	in Chinese.
74000	76000	It may look
76000	78000	difficult to read.
78000	80000	This is Zhu Yi, Wang Zhu Yi.
80000	82000	I graduated
82000	84000	from the University of South California
84000	86000	with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering.
86000	88000	Previously,
88000	90000	I studied
90000	92000	light design
92000	94000	at the University of Taiwan.
94000	96000	When I was in college,
96000	98000	I studied
98000	100000	electrical engineering.
100000	102000	It may look
102000	104000	a bit complicated
104000	106000	but
106000	108000	it is
108000	110000	related to
110000	112000	system integration
112000	114000	and system design.
118000	120000	What I'm doing now
120000	122000	is a post-Ph.D.
122000	124000	research.
124000	126000	I'm working with
126000	128000	my co-director,
128000	130000	Stephen Lu,
130000	132000	who is doing
132000	134000	post-Ph.D. research
134000	136000	at USC.
136000	138000	I'd like to thank
138000	140000	Taiwan and USC
140000	142000	for their cooperation.
142000	144000	This is one of the
144000	146000	funding
146000	148000	for my post-Ph.D.
148000	150000	fellowship.
150000	152000	I can continue
152000	154000	my post-Ph.D. research at USC.
154000	156000	I also did
156000	158000	some administrative work.
158000	160000	The title sounds better.
160000	162000	It's about
162000	164000	designing product design
164000	166000	for students
166000	168000	and
168000	170000	maintaining
170000	172000	communication and
172000	174000	program.
174000	176000	I also had
176000	178000	a chance to teach
178000	180000	at USC.
180000	182000	I taught
182000	184000	two classes.
184000	186000	The first class
186000	188000	was
188000	190000	about
190000	192000	product development
192000	194000	and engineering.
194000	196000	The second class
196000	198000	was about
198000	200000	market
200000	202000	direction
202000	204000	and
204000	206000	how to
206000	208000	design.
208000	210000	The third class
210000	212000	was about
212000	214000	conceptual design.
214000	216000	I didn't teach this class
216000	218000	at USC,
218000	220000	but I'm going to
220000	222000	teach this class
222000	224000	at USC.
226000	228000	This is
228000	230000	today's topic.
230000	232000	Today's topic is
232000	234000	innovative design
234000	236000	thinking.
236000	238000	I'm going to focus on
238000	240000	conceptual design.
240000	242000	This is also
242000	244000	my specialty.
244000	246000	The so-called design framework
246000	248000	is a framework
248000	250000	that
250000	252000	doesn't tell you
252000	254000	how to do it.
254000	256000	If you follow
256000	258000	this framework
258000	260000	to design,
260000	262000	you can get
262000	264000	better results.
264000	266000	When we
266000	268000	talk about the framework,
268000	270000	we say it's
270000	272000	a prescriptive.
272000	274000	It's a bit like
274000	276000	the doctor's prescription.
276000	278000	It's based on your symptoms
278000	280000	and his experience.
280000	282000	He thinks this way
282000	284000	and you can follow
284000	286000	this and get better
286000	288000	results.
288000	290000	So we say it's
290000	292000	a framework,
292000	294000	not a prescriptive.
294000	296000	In this framework,
296000	298000	it might tell you
298000	300000	what you can do
300000	302000	at this stage
302000	304000	and what you can do
304000	306000	at that stage.
306000	308000	In fact,
308000	310000	this framework
310000	312000	doesn't just
312000	314000	focus on
314000	316000	conceptual design.
316000	318000	We don't have
318000	320000	a lot of time today.
320000	322000	My research
322000	324000	is also
324000	326000	focused on
326000	328000	conceptual design.
328000	330000	This is what I'm going to talk about today.
330000	332000	Before we get started,
332000	334000	I have a joke
334000	336000	to share with you.
336000	338000	Every time I
338000	340000	start a class,
340000	342000	I ask the students
342000	344000	if there are
344000	346000	five birds
346000	348000	on a tree
348000	350000	and a hunter
350000	352000	shoots a bullet,
352000	354000	how many birds
354000	356000	are still on the tree?
356000	358000	Does anyone
358000	360000	want to try to answer?
364000	366000	They all flew away.
368000	370000	I'm the one who
370000	372000	asked the question,
372000	374000	so I'll tell you
374000	376000	that there are three birds.
376000	378000	Why are there three birds?
380000	382000	Why are
382000	384000	these three birds
384000	386000	still on the tree?
388000	390000	In theory,
390000	392000	the shot should fly away.
392000	394000	Why are they still on the tree?
394000	396000	They were shocked.
398000	400000	Maybe.
400000	402000	But these three birds
402000	404000	are actually smart.
404000	406000	They are engineers.
406000	408000	But because they want
408000	410000	to pursue the optimal path,
410000	412000	they are still calculating
412000	414000	how to fly
414000	416000	so that they won't
416000	418000	be shot by the hunter.
418000	420000	So they are still calculating.
420000	422000	Because they are still calculating,
422000	424000	there are still three birds
424000	426000	on the tree.
426000	428000	The second question is
428000	430000	that there are
430000	432000	five birds,
432000	434000	three birds on the tree,
434000	436000	and two birds flew away.
436000	438000	What happened to them?
438000	440000	Did they
440000	442000	successfully fly away
442000	444000	or were they shot to death?
444000	446000	It's raining.
446000	448000	It makes sense.
448000	450000	The answer here
450000	452000	is that
452000	454000	they fell to the ground.
454000	456000	But why did they
456000	458000	fall to the ground?
458000	460000	They didn't faint.
460000	462000	Because these two birds
462000	464000	are actually managers.
464000	466000	They know
466000	468000	that the right decision
468000	470000	should be to fly away
470000	472000	or be shot by the hunter.
472000	474000	But because they are managers,
474000	476000	they have forgotten
476000	478000	how to fly.
478000	480000	So they fell to the ground.
480000	482000	This is a joke.
482000	484000	Engineers
484000	486000	usually
486000	488000	talk about
488000	490000	how to calculate
490000	492000	the optimal path
492000	494000	and how to
494000	496000	do the best.
496000	498000	This is to do
498000	500000	this thing well.
500000	502000	But sometimes
502000	504000	we forget that
504000	506000	there may be some
506000	508000	so-called
508000	510000	social reality.
510000	512000	We may have some
512000	514000	time problems
514000	516000	or some restrictions.
516000	518000	We have to make a decision right away.
518000	520000	To make a decision right away
520000	522000	is like a manager.
522000	524000	Their responsibility
524000	526000	is to make the right decision
526000	528000	and do the right thing.
528000	530000	But if
530000	532000	they didn't
532000	534000	make the right balance,
534000	536000	there is one without two,
536000	538000	and there is two without one.
538000	540000	At this stage
540000	542000	of conceptual design,
542000	544000	there may be some
544000	546000	things we will be ignored.
546000	548000	How to
548000	550000	do these two things
550000	552000	well?
552000	554000	In conceptual design,
554000	556000	we want to
556000	558000	discuss and give
558000	560000	a prescription.
560000	562000	This is connected to
562000	564000	product development.
564000	566000	In a
566000	568000	product development process,
568000	570000	it is usually
570000	572000	like this.
572000	574000	From the concept
574000	576000	to the final release
576000	578000	to the market.
578000	580000	Product
580000	582000	is something
582000	584000	to be sold in the future.
584000	586000	So we will consider
586000	588000	the social reality
588000	590000	and the market.
590000	592000	We will consider
592000	594000	global competition
594000	596000	or some
596000	598000	demand
598000	600000	and supply.
602000	604000	On the other hand,
604000	606000	there is a downstream part,
606000	608000	the so-called
608000	610000	reality.
610000	612000	This part is to consider
612000	614000	technology restrictions
614000	616000	or the current stage of
616000	618000	technology,
618000	620000	or how to
620000	622000	optimize,
622000	624000	how to
624000	626000	make this product
626000	628000	the best part.
628000	630000	So there is a so-called
630000	632000	upstream and downstream balance
632000	634000	that needs to be considered
634000	636000	in the process of product design.
636000	638000	The upstream part
638000	640000	is called
640000	642000	do the right thing.
642000	644000	Conceptual design is
644000	646000	to consider
646000	648000	the concept of
648000	650000	the design
650000	652000	between the two sides.
656000	658000	This upstream part
658000	660000	is the main part
660000	662000	of ISE 545.
662000	664000	AME 546
664000	666000	is the new customer
666000	668000	conceptual design part.
668000	670000	The other part
670000	672000	is to consider
672000	674000	the design framework
674000	676000	between the two sides.
680000	682000	The design framework
682000	684000	is the middle part
684000	686000	of ISE 545.
686000	688000	The design framework
688000	690000	is the middle part
690000	692000	of ISE 545.
692000	694000	The design framework
694000	696000	is the middle part
696000	698000	of ISE 545.
698000	700000	The design framework
700000	702000	is the middle part
702000	704000	of ISE 545.
704000	706000	So we don't
706000	708000	want to start
708000	710000	from the very top.
710000	712000	We want to
712000	714000	be good enough.
718000	720000	If there is a good
720000	722000	on-line design,
722000	724000	then the product
724000	726000	can be done
726000	728000	to reach the optimal
728000	730000	product.
730000	732000	So in fact,
732000	734000	in the design process,
734000	736000	we emphasize that
736000	738000	what we want to consider is
738000	740000	good enough, not
740000	742000	best or ideal.
742000	744000	Because
744000	746000	there are two sides to consider.
746000	748000	On the one hand, it's social reality.
748000	750000	On the other hand, it's plurality.
750000	752000	In other words,
752000	754000	we want to meet our goals,
754000	756000	but it has to be
756000	758000	operational.
758000	760000	So this is
760000	762000	what we will
762000	764000	consider
764000	766000	when designing
766000	768000	products.
768000	770000	A product design
770000	772000	from nothing to something
772000	774000	goes through
774000	776000	three main design
776000	778000	stages.
778000	780000	The first is functional design.
780000	782000	The second is conceptual design.
782000	784000	The third is technical design.
784000	786000	Functional design
786000	788000	is defined from
788000	790000	Cn to Fr,
790000	792000	which is the customer's needs
792000	794000	to the functional requirements.
794000	796000	These are the functional
796000	798000	requirements.
798000	800000	The functional requirements
800000	802000	go to the design parameters.
802000	804000	To put it simply,
804000	806000	DP is the concept
806000	808000	of design.
808000	810000	In this process,
810000	812000	there may not be
812000	814000	some actual numbers,
814000	816000	actual sizes,
816000	818000	or its geometric shape.
818000	820000	It is a conceptual design.
820000	822000	Then there is technical design,
822000	824000	which is to turn these concepts
824000	826000	into actual things.
826000	828000	There will be some process variables.
828000	830000	We
830000	832000	divide these four parts
832000	834000	into four domains.
834000	836000	In this process,
836000	838000	Cn to Fr, we call it functional design.
838000	840000	Fr to DP, we call it conceptual design.
840000	842000	DP to PV, we call it
842000	844000	technical design.
844000	846000	In this part,
846000	848000	we mainly focus on
848000	850000	conceptual design.
850000	852000	There are two phases.
852000	854000	The first is concept generation.
854000	856000	The second is concept improvement.
856000	858000	Why do we
858000	860000	talk about conceptual design?
860000	862000	Why do we do this research?
862000	864000	We know that
864000	866000	in the design process,
866000	868000	it seems that
868000	870000	there is no need
870000	872000	for rules.
872000	874000	It seems that
874000	876000	some creative things
876000	878000	can be created.
878000	880000	But in the process,
880000	882000	we found that
882000	884000	if you just do brainstorming
884000	886000	or have some ideas,
886000	888000	what if these things
888000	890000	can't be realized?
890000	892000	In conceptual design,
892000	894000	it is in the middle stage.
894000	896000	You have to find a way
896000	898000	to meet the needs of customers
898000	900000	or to attract
900000	902000	customers' interest.
902000	904000	You also have to
904000	906000	meet the
906000	908000	unfulfilled
908000	910000	demands.
910000	912000	In downstream,
912000	914000	you have to
914000	916000	be able to realize
916000	918000	the concept,
918000	920000	not just
920000	922000	empty thoughts.
922000	924000	In terms of profit,
924000	926000	you have to consider
926000	928000	the cost.
928000	930000	In this aspect,
930000	932000	conceptual design
932000	934000	is not that easy.
934000	936000	But it is also
936000	938000	an important phase.
938000	940000	In terms of
940000	942000	design,
942000	944000	it is in the early stage.
944000	946000	Generally speaking,
946000	948000	most companies
948000	950000	don't have
950000	952000	a concept
952000	954000	when they are
954000	956000	designing.
956000	958000	They have to find a way
958000	960000	to realize it.
960000	962000	It is a technical design.
962000	964000	But if you consider
964000	966000	the long-term
966000	968000	or new things,
968000	970000	from nothing
970000	972000	to something,
972000	974000	it is an opportunity.
974000	976000	For product development,
976000	978000	it is a very important phase.
978000	980000	In terms of
980000	982000	conceptual design,
982000	984000	if it is okay,
984000	986000	it is a good decision.
986000	988000	If you know
988000	990000	it is good,
990000	992000	it can be realized
992000	994000	in downstream.
994000	996000	It can have
996000	998000	low complexity
998000	1000000	and good results.
1004000	1006000	But it is not easy
1006000	1008000	because it is in the middle.
1008000	1010000	It has to consider upstream
1010000	1012000	and downstream.
1012000	1014000	In the process,
1014000	1016000	it does not have
1016000	1018000	actual data.
1018000	1020000	It is not like
1020000	1022000	you have a prototype
1022000	1024000	and you can measure
1024000	1026000	on-board testing results.
1026000	1028000	How can we
1028000	1030000	make sure
1030000	1032000	the concept is okay?
1032000	1034000	We have to think about
1034000	1036000	how to make it
1036000	1038000	as ideal and practical
1038000	1040000	as possible.
1040000	1042000	We know
1042000	1044000	conceptual design
1044000	1046000	is from FR to DP.
1046000	1048000	First,
1048000	1050000	how does this FR come from?
1050000	1052000	This FR is
1052000	1054000	from functional design.
1054000	1056000	But this part
1056000	1058000	is not included here.
1058000	1060000	I will not
1060000	1062000	talk about
1062000	1064000	how to find this FR.
1064000	1066000	However,
1066000	1068000	the definition of FR
1068000	1070000	is very important
1070000	1072000	in terms of
1072000	1074000	how innovative
1074000	1076000	the product will be
1076000	1078000	in the future.
1078000	1080000	In my class,
1080000	1082000	we did not
1082000	1084000	talk about it
1084000	1086000	in conceptual design.
1086000	1088000	In this talk,
1088000	1090000	I will talk about
1090000	1092000	the concept of FR.
1092000	1094000	It is the
1094000	1096000	pre-process
1096000	1098000	of conceptual design.
1098000	1100000	It is a function
1100000	1102000	that we have to define
1102000	1104000	what functions
1104000	1106000	these concepts
1106000	1108000	must meet.
1108000	1110000	How do these functions
1110000	1112000	come from?
1112000	1114000	These functions
1114000	1116000	come from customer needs.
1116000	1118000	These functions
1118000	1120000	are defined
1120000	1122000	by designers,
1122000	1124000	not customers.
1124000	1126000	For example,
1126000	1128000	customer needs
1128000	1130000	often change.
1130000	1132000	Sometimes,
1132000	1134000	we talk about
1134000	1136000	observing
1136000	1138000	the emerging lifestyle.
1138000	1140000	In addition,
1140000	1142000	we talk about
1142000	1144000	need and want.
1144000	1146000	When the
1146000	1148000	functional requirement
1148000	1150000	is closer to
1150000	1152000	the basic needs,
1152000	1154000	the market
1154000	1156000	is larger,
1156000	1158000	but the profit
1158000	1160000	is smaller.
1160000	1162000	If it is closer
1162000	1164000	to the so-called want,
1164000	1166000	the profit is larger,
1166000	1168000	but the market
1168000	1170000	is smaller.
1170000	1172000	In the process of choosing,
1172000	1174000	we talk about
1174000	1176000	some strategies
1176000	1178000	when it comes to
1178000	1180000	functional design.
1180000	1182000	For example,
1182000	1184000	we talk about
1184000	1186000	triggering need
1186000	1188000	into want
1188000	1190000	or want into need.
1190000	1192000	We also talk about
1192000	1194000	different features
1194000	1196000	such as
1196000	1198000	kind of model.
1198000	1200000	Excitement feature
1200000	1202000	and time change
1202000	1204000	are discussed
1204000	1206000	in functional design.
1206000	1208000	However,
1208000	1210000	this talk
1210000	1212000	will not cover
1212000	1214000	this topic.
1214000	1216000	As I mentioned,
1216000	1218000	functional design
1218000	1220000	is an important
1220000	1222000	prelude to innovation
1222000	1224000	when defining
1224000	1226000	functional requirements.
1226000	1228000	Many things
1228000	1230000	need to be considered
1230000	1232000	when designing
1232000	1234000	functional requirements.
1234000	1236000	For example,
1236000	1238000	the phone holder
1238000	1240000	is a common
1240000	1242000	design,
1242000	1244000	but it is not
1244000	1246000	a good design.
1246000	1248000	Why?
1248000	1250000	Because
1250000	1252000	it is not
1252000	1254000	a good design
1254000	1256000	in California.
1256000	1258000	In California,
1258000	1260000	there may be
1260000	1262000	some restrictions.
1262000	1264000	Also,
1264000	1266000	California has
1266000	1268000	bad sunlight.
1268000	1270000	If you
1270000	1272000	have a phone
1272000	1274000	like this,
1274000	1276000	you will be told
1276000	1278000	that your phone
1278000	1280000	must be turned off
1280000	1282000	or can't be charged
1282000	1284000	because it is too hot.
1284000	1286000	There is another possibility
1286000	1288000	when designing
1288000	1290000	functional requirements.
1290000	1292000	For example,
1292000	1294000	if the sunlight is too strong,
1294000	1296000	the phone holder
1296000	1298000	should be placed
1298000	1300000	on the back of the phone.
1300000	1302000	However,
1302000	1304000	this is not a good design
1304000	1306000	because
1306000	1308000	the driver
1308000	1310000	will have to
1310000	1312000	look down
1312000	1314000	when driving.
1314000	1316000	Although it solves
1316000	1318000	A's requirement,
1318000	1320000	it does not solve
1320000	1322000	B's requirement
1322000	1324000	or other problems.
1324000	1326000	This is the design
1326000	1328000	of the phone holder
1328000	1330000	at the air outlet.
1330000	1332000	This is the design
1332000	1334000	of the phone holder
1334000	1336000	at the air outlet.
1336000	1338000	This is the design
1338000	1340000	of the phone holder
1340000	1342000	at the air outlet.
1342000	1344000	This is the design
1344000	1346000	of the phone holder
1346000	1348000	at the air outlet.
1348000	1350000	However,
1350000	1352000	there is a problem.
1352000	1354000	If
1354000	1356000	the phone holder
1356000	1358000	is sold in California,
1358000	1360000	if it is sold
1360000	1362000	in cold places,
1362000	1364000	such as
1364000	1366000	Michigan or Denver,
1366000	1368000	it will snow.
1368000	1370000	When it snows,
1370000	1372000	the driver
1372000	1374000	must turn on the heater.
1374000	1376000	However,
1376000	1378000	once the heater is turned on,
1378000	1380000	there will be a hot wind.
1380000	1382000	So,
1382000	1384000	the phone holder
1384000	1386000	will be too hot
1386000	1388000	when it snows.
1388000	1390000	So,
1390000	1392000	the phone holder
1392000	1394000	will be too hot
1394000	1396000	when it snows.
1396000	1398000	When the phone holder
1398000	1400000	is sold,
1400000	1402000	the driver
1402000	1404000	must turn off the heater,
1404000	1406000	and put the phone holder
1406000	1408000	in a storage bag.
1408000	1410000	The driver
1410000	1412000	must then
1412000	1414000	put the phone holder
1414000	1416000	in a storage bag,
1416000	1418000	put the phone holder
1418000	1420000	in a storage bag,
1420000	1422000	and turn it off.
1422000	1424000	If the driver
1424000	1426000	is not turning on the heater,
1426000	1428000	the phone holder
1428000	1430000	must be turned off.
1430000	1432000	The driver
1432000	1434000	must then
1434000	1436000	put the phone holder
1436000	1438000	in a storage bag,
1438000	1440000	put the phone holder
1440000	1442000	in a storage bag,
1442000	1444000	and turn it off.
1444000	1446000	If the driver
1446000	1448000	is not turning on the heater,
1448000	1450000	the phone holder
1450000	1452000	must be turned on.
1482000	1484000	The basic framework
1484000	1486000	of the process
1486000	1488000	is to
1488000	1490000	organize
1490000	1492000	the information
1492000	1494000	and make
1494000	1496000	the decision
1496000	1498000	after
1498000	1500000	organizing
1500000	1502000	the information
1502000	1504000	and making
1504000	1506000	the decision
1506000	1508000	after
1508000	1510000	organizing
1510000	1516000	the
1516000	1518000	information
1518000	1520000	and making
1520000	1522000	the decision
1522000	1524000	after
1524000	1526000	organizing
1526000	1528000	the information
1528000	1530000	and making
1530000	1532000	the decision
1532000	1534000	after
1534000	1536000	organizing
1536000	1538000	the information
1568000	1569000	after
1569000	1571000	organizing
1571000	1573000	the information
1573000	1575000	and SDG
1575000	1577000	and making
1577000	1579000	the decision
1579000	1581000	after
1581000	1583000	organizing
1583000	1585000	the information
1585000	1586000	and making
1586000	1589000	the decision
1589000	1591000	after
1591000	1593000	organizing
1593000	1595000	the information
1595000	1596000	and making
1596000	1600000	the decision
1600000	1601000	after
1601000	1602000	organizing
1602000	1603000	the information
1603000	1604000	and making
1604000	1606000	the decision
1606000	1608000	after
1608000	1610000	organizing
1610000	1614000	the information
1614000	1617000	and making
1617000	1621000	the decision
1621000	1625000	and
1625000	1627000	making
1627000	1629000	the decision
1629000	1631000	after

1767000	1768000	the decision
1768000	1770000	after
1770000	1772000	organizing
1772000	1774000	the information
1774000	1776000	and making
1776000	1778000	the decision
1780000	1782000	after organizing
1784000	1786000	the information
1786000	1788000	and making
1788000	1790000	the decision
1790000	1792000	and making
1792000	1794000	the decision
1796000	1798000	after organizing
1798000	1800000	the information
1800000	1802000	and making
1802000	1804000	the decision
1804000	1806000	after organizing
1806000	1808000	the information
1808000	1810000	and making
1810000	1812000	the decision
1816000	1818000	after organizing
1818000	1820000	If it's not in there,
1820000	1822000	it's a synthetic proposition.
1824000	1826000	For example,
1828000	1830000	let's say
1830000	1832000	a bicycle
1832000	1834000	has two wheels.
1834000	1836000	A bicycle has two wheels.
1836000	1838000	This is an
1840000	1842000	analytic proposition.
1844000	1846000	The basic definition of a bicycle
1846000	1848000	is that it has two wheels.
1848000	1850000	The basic definition of a bicycle
1850000	1852000	is that it has two wheels.
1852000	1854000	This is an
1854000	1856000	analytic proposition.
1858000	1860000	Or let's say
1860000	1862000	a single man
1862000	1864000	is not married.
1864000	1866000	This is also an analytic proposition.
1866000	1868000	But if we say
1868000	1870000	that
1870000	1876000	if it's not in there,
1876000	1878000	it's a synthetic proposition.
1878000	1880000	it's a synthetic proposition.
1880000	1882000	For example,
1882000	1884000	if you go to school,
1884000	1886000	you have to ride a bicycle.
1886000	1888000	You don't have to ride a bicycle
1888000	1890000	to go to school,
1890000	1892000	but a bicycle is a method.
1892000	1894000	It's not in there.
1894000	1896000	This is a
1896000	1898000	synthetic proposition.
1900000	1902000	So,
1902000	1904000	through this synthetic
1904000	1906000	and analytic proposition,
1906000	1908000	we can change the interaction
1908000	1910000	and create the idea.
1910000	1912000	So,
1912000	1914000	the basic process
1914000	1916000	is that we need to do
1916000	1918000	a specified action
1918000	1920000	and then do an idea.
1920000	1922000	Then we integrate
1922000	1924000	the concept of the product.
1924000	1926000	Then we do
1926000	1928000	a validated action
1928000	1930000	and then we do
1930000	1932000	a validated action
1932000	1934000	to form the concept formation.
1934000	1936000	This is the basic
1936000	1938000	part of the concept formation.
1938000	1940000	You have to follow
1940000	1942000	these four steps
1942000	1944000	to create a cycle.
1944000	1946000	Then you can go from
1946000	1948000	FR to DP.
1950000	1952000	For example,
1952000	1954000	our FR function
1954000	1956000	is to fly.
1956000	1958000	The specified action
1958000	1960000	is to fly.
1960000	1962000	The specified action
1962000	1964000	is to lift.
1964000	1966000	The specified action
1966000	1968000	is to lift.
1968000	1970000	The specified action
1970000	1972000	is to lift.
1972000	1974000	There are some ways
1974000	1976000	to lift.
1976000	1978000	After the idea,
1978000	1980000	we use wings.
1980000	1982000	If you have wings,
1982000	1984000	you can lift it up
1984000	1986000	and then
1986000	1988000	we can create
1988000	1990000	a concept.
1990000	1992000	It may be an airplane
1992000	1994000	because the airplane
1994000	1996000	has wings.
1996000	1998000	It may be
1998000	2000000	a final concept
2000000	2002000	that can
2002000	2004000	satisfy
2004000	2006000	the fly action.
2006000	2008000	Because of this,
2008000	2010000	we can have a lot of solutions.
2010000	2012000	For example,
2012000	2014000	we can say
2014000	2016000	to fly, not to lift.
2016000	2018000	To lift, we can
2018000	2020000	use hot air to lift it up.
2020000	2022000	So we may have
2022000	2024000	hot air balloons
2024000	2026000	to make hot air balloons
2026000	2028000	to satisfy the fly action.
2028000	2030000	There are
2030000	2032000	different solutions
2032000	2034000	such as rockets.
2034000	2036000	If it is
2036000	2038000	wings and then
2038000	2040000	to lift,
2040000	2042000	it may not satisfy
2042000	2044000	the logic.
2044000	2046000	The concept is not feasible
2046000	2048000	if wings are not a part
2048000	2050000	of the balloon.
2050000	2052000	If wings are not a part
2052000	2054000	of the balloon.
2054000	2056000	There are several
2056000	2058000	solutions
2058000	2060000	only by the cycle.
2060000	2062000	There are several solutions
2062000	2064000	only by the cycle.
2064000	2066000	There are several solutions
2066000	2068000	only by the cycle.
2068000	2072000	There are several solutions
2072000	2074000	only by the cycle.
2074000	2076000	There are several solutions
2076000	2078000	only by the cycle.
2078000	2080000	Wings are just a part
2080000	2082000	of the airplane.
2082000	2084000	We can imagine
2084000	2086000	that a wing is not
2086000	2088000	a complete plane.
2088000	2090000	So, how do we get
2090000	2092000	to this point?
2092000	2094000	How do hot air
2094000	2096000	get to there?
2096000	2098000	You need to organize
2098000	2100000	the idea
2100000	2102000	so that you can
2102000	2104000	have a complete
2104000	2106000	plan and concept.
2106000	2108000	Then,
2108000	2110000	when you realize it,
2110000	2112000	it will be more
2112000	2114000	visible.
2114000	2116000	it will be more visible.
2116000	2118000	So,
2118000	2120000	we need to
2120000	2122000	use
2122000	2124000	the so-called hierarchy
2124000	2126000	to organize the idea.
2126000	2128000	to organize the idea.
2128000	2130000	We need to specify it.
2130000	2132000	We need to specify it.
2132000	2134000	We need to decompose it.
2134000	2136000	We need to decompose it.
2136000	2138000	We need to decompose it.
2138000	2140000	We need to decompose it.
2140000	2142000	So,
2142000	2144000	the how-what
2144000	2146000	will be
2146000	2148000	different parts.
2148000	2150000	The different functions
2150000	2152000	will be more detailed.
2152000	2154000	Then,
2154000	2156000	after the idea
2156000	2158000	is created,
2158000	2160000	we will
2160000	2162000	combine it
2162000	2164000	with
2164000	2166000	the composition
2166000	2168000	to get
2168000	2170000	a concept.
2170000	2172000	So, we can
2172000	2174000	top-down it,
2174000	2176000	bottom-up it,
2176000	2178000	and complete it.
2178000	2180000	This concept
2180000	2182000	is not just a concept.
2182000	2184000	It follows
2184000	2186000	the logic.
2186000	2188000	So, you can know
2188000	2190000	the details.
2190000	2192000	What does this concept
2192000	2194000	contain?
2194000	2196000	What is the relationship
2196000	2198000	between these things?
2198000	2200000	For example,
2200000	2202000	this is because it meets
2202000	2204000	this condition, this function.
2204000	2206000	This is because it meets
2206000	2208000	this function.
2208000	2210000	Because we have this
2210000	2212000	so-called cycle,
2212000	2214000	specify idea,
2214000	2216000	integrate,
2216000	2218000	and then,
2218000	2220000	finally,
2220000	2222000	we have a concept.
2222000	2224000	But, we need to validate
2224000	2226000	this concept
2226000	2228000	to be sure
2228000	2230000	that this thing
2230000	2232000	can achieve this function.
2232000	2234000	Also,
2234000	2236000	we use
2236000	2238000	only some concepts
2238000	2240000	in this part.
2240000	2242000	We don't have data.
2242000	2244000	So, how can we
2244000	2246000	make the next step
2246000	2248000	to achieve
2248000	2250000	this concept?
2250000	2252000	We use
2252000	2254000	this dual hierarchical structure
2254000	2256000	to make
2256000	2258000	this
2258000	2260000	concept.
2260000	2262000	So,
2262000	2264000	the first step is
2264000	2266000	to decompose
2266000	2268000	this function
2268000	2270000	into
2270000	2272000	some small
2272000	2274000	paper systems
2274000	2276000	with different
2276000	2278000	paper functions.
2278000	2280000	Then, we find a solution
2280000	2282000	for each function.
2282000	2284000	Then, we integrate
2284000	2286000	these two concepts
2286000	2288000	to have a complete concept.
2288000	2290000	Then,
2290000	2292000	we verify
2292000	2294000	that this paper system
2294000	2296000	meets
2296000	2298000	our main function needs.
2298000	2300000	Then,
2300000	2302000	this paper system
2302000	2304000	may have some
2304000	2306000	actual limitations
2306000	2308000	or so-called
2308000	2310000	external limitations
2310000	2312000	and external conditions.
2312000	2314000	So,
2314000	2316000	when we decompose
2316000	2318000	this function,
2318000	2320000	we won't have
2320000	2322000	this paper system.
2322000	2324000	Then,
2324000	2326000	we can move on
2326000	2328000	to the next step
2328000	2330000	and make it more
2330000	2332000	geometric.
2332000	2334000	This paper system
2334000	2336000	is based on
2336000	2338000	the concept
2338000	2340000	we have already
2340000	2342000	developed.
2342000	2344000	For example,
2344000	2346000	if we want to
2346000	2348000	design something
2348000	2350000	that can be
2350000	2352000	transported,
2352000	2354000	we may want
2354000	2356000	to have
2356000	2358000	a support
2358000	2360000	and a
2360000	2362000	thing that
2362000	2364000	can be moved
2364000	2366000	to support
2366000	2368000	and to move.
2368000	2370000	Then,
2370000	2372000	if we want to
2372000	2374000	design something
2374000	2376000	that can be
2376000	2378000	transported,
2378000	2380000	we may want
2380000	2382000	to have
2382000	2384000	a support
2384000	2386000	and a thing
2386000	2388000	that can be
2388000	2390000	moved.
2390000	2392000	Then,
2392000	2394000	if we want to
2394000	2396000	design something

3904000	3906000	transported,
3906000	3908000	we may want
3908000	3910000	to have
3910000	3912000	a support
3912000	3914000	and a thing
3914000	3916000	that can be
3916000	3918000	moved.
3918000	3920000	Recently,
3920000	3922000	we have been doing
3922000	3924000	a new material development.
3924000	3926000	Recently,
3926000	3928000	no one has done this
3928000	3930000	before,
3930000	3932000	but we have to
3932000	3934000	be responsible to our shareholders,
3934000	3936000	investors.
3936000	3938000	I think we may have some difficulties
3938000	3940000	when discussing these things.
3940000	3942000	How can we use
3942000	3944000	conceptual design
3944000	3946000	to convince investors
3946000	3948000	that we have reached a certain stage?
3948000	3950000	How can we use
3950000	3952000	this concept
3952000	3954000	to present a better vision
3954000	3956000	or show them
3956000	3958000	where the money is coming from?
3958000	3960000	After all, investors value
3960000	3962000	whether we can make money.
3962000	3964000	I understand.
3964000	3966000	Your question is
3966000	3968000	that you have a product,
3968000	3970000	but you want to
3970000	3972000	talk to investors
3972000	3974000	about how to make
3974000	3976000	investors accept
3976000	3978000	and invest in this project.
3980000	3982000	Yes.
3982000	3984000	This is my idea.
3984000	3986000	Conceptual design
3986000	3988000	is a place
3988000	3990000	where concepts
3990000	3992000	are generated and implemented.
3992000	3994000	You may want to
3994000	3996000	talk about
3996000	3998000	how this thing
3998000	4000000	can be
4000000	4002000	implemented.
4002000	4004000	In terms of investors,
4004000	4006000	conceptual design
4006000	4008000	is more market-oriented.
4008000	4010000	As I said before,
4010000	4012000	we may have
4012000	4014000	two pieces.
4014000	4016000	One is upstream,
4016000	4018000	the market part.
4018000	4020000	The other is downstream.
4024000	4026000	The upstream part
4026000	4028000	is the market part.
4028000	4030000	The downstream part
4030000	4032000	is the technology part.
4032000	4034000	Conceptual design
4034000	4036000	is in the middle.
4036000	4038000	You can consider
4038000	4040000	whether the product
4040000	4042000	meets the market demand.
4042000	4044000	Whether the so-called
4044000	4046000	functions
4046000	4048000	can make
4048000	4050000	consumers
4050000	4052000	want to buy
4052000	4054000	or whether
4054000	4056000	the market demand
4056000	4058000	already exists.
4058000	4060000	This can convince
4060000	4062000	investors to look at this part.
4062000	4064000	Because what they look at
4064000	4066000	is the upstream part.
4066000	4068000	The downstream part
4068000	4070000	is what you
4070000	4072000	develop
4072000	4074000	and do.
4074000	4076000	There may be some
4076000	4078000	practical difficulties.
4078000	4080000	Investors
4080000	4082000	don't care
4082000	4084000	about the specifications
4084000	4086000	of the product.
4086000	4088000	What they care about
4088000	4090000	is whether
4090000	4092000	the product can make money.
4092000	4094000	So,
4094000	4096000	we will consider
4096000	4098000	the concept part
4098000	4100000	which is more
4100000	4102000	market-oriented.
4102000	4104000	The function part
4104000	4106000	is more
4106000	4108000	market-oriented.
4108000	4110000	So,
4110000	4112000	you can consider
4112000	4114000	whether the product
4114000	4116000	has innovation
4116000	4118000	and market demand.
4118000	4120000	Whether
4120000	4122000	it has enough
4122000	4124000	competitors
4124000	4126000	or
4126000	4128000	market analysis.
4128000	4130000	It's like
4130000	4132000	what I talked about
4132000	4134000	in ISE.
4134000	4136000	It's about
4136000	4138000	functional design.
4138000	4140000	How to go from
4140000	4142000	functional design to
4142000	4144000	functional requirement.
4144000	4146000	I can't cover this part today.
4146000	4148000	But you can
4148000	4150000	talk about
4150000	4152000	some
4152000	4154000	main concepts
4154000	4156000	like
4156000	4158000	whether
4158000	4160000	your product
4160000	4162000	focuses on need
4162000	4164000	or want.
4164000	4166000	Demand may be
4166000	4168000	need or want.
4168000	4170000	But the profit
4170000	4172000	must be small.
4172000	4174000	If your product
4174000	4176000	meets the need
4176000	4178000	function,
4178000	4180000	your market
4180000	4182000	will be big.
4182000	4184000	But you must make
4184000	4186000	your product cheaper.
4186000	4188000	Then your profit
4188000	4190000	will be relatively small.
4190000	4192000	When we talk about
4192000	4194000	innovation,
4194000	4196000	we don't recommend
4196000	4198000	the product
4198000	4200000	meets the need
4200000	4202000	function.
4202000	4204000	People will want to
4204000	4206000	buy it.
4206000	4208000	Although
4208000	4210000	you are a new
4210000	4212000	founder or a new company,
4212000	4214000	your market
4214000	4216000	or market
4216000	4218000	is not high enough.
4218000	4220000	You may not have
4220000	4222000	enough
4222000	4224000	basic demand
4224000	4226000	but you can stimulate
4226000	4228000	people to buy it.
4228000	4230000	Your profit
4230000	4232000	can cover
4232000	4234000	the production cost
4234000	4236000	of two or three products.
4236000	4238000	Then you can
4238000	4240000	convince your investors
4240000	4242000	to invest in this product.
4242000	4244000	In addition,
4244000	4246000	we have the so-called
4246000	4248000	Canon Model.
4248000	4250000	You can see
4250000	4252000	that
4252000	4254000	it has some functions.
4254000	4256000	It has basic features,
4256000	4258000	performance features,
4258000	4260000	and excitement features.
4260000	4262000	In other words,
4262000	4264000	if we
4264000	4266000	want to
4266000	4268000	sell a smartphone
4268000	4270000	in this market,
4270000	4272000	we have to have
4272000	4274000	a camera function.
4274000	4276000	It must be able to
4276000	4278000	download an app
4278000	4280000	or have many functions.
4280000	4282000	This has become a basic feature.
4282000	4284000	Its performance
4284000	4286000	feature may be that the
4286000	4288000	resolution of my camera
4288000	4290000	is better or
4290000	4292000	the speed of my CPU
4292000	4294000	is faster.
4294000	4296000	The excitement feature
4296000	4298000	is a bit like
4298000	4300000	when they promote
4300000	4302000	their products
4302000	4304000	to their investors
4304000	4306000	or consumers,
4306000	4308000	they talk about
4308000	4310000	what's different
4310000	4312000	and what's special.
4312000	4314000	For example,
4314000	4316000	when they launch
4316000	4318000	the iPhone X,
4318000	4320000	they will talk about
4320000	4322000	facial recognition
4322000	4324000	and so on.
4324000	4326000	They must have
4326000	4328000	something that can
4328000	4330000	stimulate consumers
4330000	4332000	to buy.
4332000	4334000	This is something
4334000	4336000	you can consider
4336000	4338000	when talking about
4338000	4340000	regional issues.
4340000	4342000	For example,
4342000	4344000	in California,
4344000	4346000	this kind of thing
4346000	4348000	may not be sold.
4348000	4350000	However,
4350000	4352000	this kind of thing
4352000	4354000	may not be sold
4354000	4356000	in other states.
4356000	4358000	You can talk to
4358000	4360000	your investors about
4360000	4362000	these ideas.
4362000	4364000	For example,
4364000	4366000	if you go to India
4366000	4368000	or South Korea,
4368000	4370000	their direction is to
4370000	4372000	launch the iPhone X.
4372000	4374000	This is different
4374000	4376000	in different countries.
4376000	4378000	You need to know
4378000	4380000	where your target market is
4380000	4382000	and where your stakeholders
4382000	4384000	are.
4384000	4386000	You can talk to them
4386000	4388000	about this.
4388000	4390000	However,
4390000	4392000	this is a bit different
4392000	4394000	in terms of
4394000	4396000	conceptual design.
4396000	4398000	This concept is not
4398000	4400000	enough for you to realize
4400000	4402000	in the next phase.
4402000	4404000	However, it meets the needs
4404000	4406000	of the previous phase.
4406000	4408000	I hope I answered your question.
4408000	4410000	I think it's good.
4410000	4412000	I'm sorry.
4412000	4414000	It sounds like B2C.
4416000	4418000	I have a few more questions.
4418000	4420000	I'm sorry.
4420000	4422000	Can you talk about this later?
4422000	4424000	I have a NDA,
4424000	4426000	so I may not be able
4426000	4428000	to answer these questions.
4430000	4432000	I have a few more questions.
4432000	4434000	Is B2C and B2B
4434000	4436000	both practical
4436000	4438000	in terms of
4438000	4440000	conceptual design?
4442000	4444000	Or is there a difference
4444000	4446000	between them?
4446000	4450000	In terms of conceptual design,
4450000	4452000	B2C and B2B
4452000	4454000	are one part
4454000	4456000	of the design.
4456000	4458000	B2C and B2B
4458000	4460000	are one part
4460000	4462000	of the design.
4462000	4464000	When you design a product,
4464000	4466000	you can't just
4466000	4468000	consider
4468000	4470000	one part of it.
4470000	4472000	Your concept
4472000	4474000	should be
4474000	4476000	whether or not
4476000	4478000	the product
4478000	4480000	can meet
4480000	4482000	the customer's needs.
4484000	4486000	In terms of conceptual design,
4486000	4488000	it can be
4488000	4490000	B2B
4490000	4492000	or B2C,
4492000	4494000	but it's not
4494000	4496000	something
4496000	4498000	you have to
4498000	4500000	talk to
4500000	4502000	your investor about.
4502000	4504000	The design
4504000	4506000	is not
4506000	4508000	a functional design.
4508000	4510000	It's a design
4510000	4512000	that you have
4512000	4514000	decided
4514000	4516000	the customer's needs.
4516000	4518000	You've seen
4518000	4520000	the demand,
4520000	4522000	so you have to
4522000	4524000	make it happen.
4524000	4526000	But if you want to
4526000	4528000	make it happen,
4528000	4530000	you can't just
4530000	4532000	decide
4532000	4534000	one part.
4534000	4535000	If you want to
4538000	4540000	develop
4540000	4542000	your products,
4542000	4544000	there should
4544000	4546000	be actions
4546000	4548000	that are
4548000	4550000	recommended
4550000	4552000	for your customers.
4552000	4554000	For example,
4554000	4556000	there should be
4556000	4558000	a reflection
4558000	4560000	to improve
4560000	4562000	existing products.
4562000	4564000	This is the part of
4564000	4566000	conceptual design.
4566000	4568000	If there is
4568000	4570000	something that is not convenient to publicize,
4570000	4572000	this is my email.
4572000	4574000	You can email me.
4574000	4576000	Can you see it?
4578000	4580000	I don't seem to have it.
4580000	4582000	Stay there.
4582000	4584000	Stay there.
4584000	4586000	There is a
4586000	4588000	dialogue box.
4588000	4590000	I see it.
4592000	4594000	Hello,
4594000	4596000	loyal listeners.
4598000	4600000	Zhu Yi left
4600000	4602000	her email in the dialogue box.
4602000	4604000	If you need to contact her,
4604000	4606000	you can use this email to contact her.
4606000	4608000	At present,
4608000	4610000	we want to
4610000	4612000	be open
4612000	4614000	and experimental.
4614000	4616000	For example,
4616000	4618000	we can have a discussion
4618000	4620000	with the speaker
4620000	4622000	on the content of the speech.
4622000	4624000	We will
4624000	4626000	post it on Facebook
4626000	4628000	and
4628000	4630000	share it
4630000	4632000	in detail
4632000	4634000	to everyone.
4634000	4636000	We are still experimenting
4636000	4638000	and not sure
4638000	4640000	how to do it.
4640000	4642000	As you know,
4642000	4644000	it is almost completely
4644000	4646000	public on Facebook.
4648000	4650000	Some things
4650000	4652000	can be discussed
4652000	4654000	privately
4654000	4656000	with the speaker
4656000	4658000	and the interviewee.
4658000	4660000	If you are interested,
4660000	4662000	you can add me on Facebook.
4662000	4664000	My Facebook name is
4664000	4666000	the same as my name,
4666000	4668000	Zhu Yi Wang.
4668000	4670000	If you are interested, you can add me.
4670000	4672000	Okay.
4672000	4674000	Thank you.
4674000	4676000	Are there any questions?
4694000	4696000	Zhu Yi,
4696000	4698000	it's your turn.
4698000	4700000	Okay, thank you.
4700000	4702000	I want to vote.
4702000	4704000	I think
4704000	4706000	Zhou Ren should
4706000	4708000	introduce himself.
4708000	4710000	Why should I introduce myself?
4710000	4712000	I'm just a useless person
4712000	4714000	who stays in Japan.
4714000	4716000	No, no.
4716000	4718000	Zhou Ren is very good at studying.
4718000	4720000	He is studying at the University of Northeast China.
4720000	4722000	We often
4722000	4724000	have a chat.
4726000	4728000	I'm glad that it's you.
4728000	4730000	Their products
4730000	4732000	are slowly
4732000	4734000	being commercialized.
4734000	4736000	At least they are
4736000	4738000	on the track of practical use.
4738000	4740000	It's not like our products
4740000	4742000	are always
4742000	4744000	in theory and
4744000	4746000	hypothesis.
4746000	4748000	It's important to make money.
4748000	4750000	I think
4750000	4752000	most people can understand
4752000	4754000	what we are doing.
4754000	4756000	It's a process
4756000	4758000	for R&D.
4758000	4760000	For example,
4760000	4762000	let's say we are sure
4762000	4764000	this product is good.
4764000	4766000	It's not only neat, but also want.
4766000	4768000	How should we tell them?
4768000	4770000	Because manufacturers
4770000	4772000	want a clean product.
4772000	4774000	I saw the previous slide.
4774000	4776000	I feel like
4776000	4778000	if I tell them
4778000	4780000	how to develop
4780000	4782000	or what design concept
4782000	4784000	I think
4784000	4786000	it's a good way
4786000	4788000	to convince
4788000	4790000	investors.
4790000	4792000	Tell them how far we have come.
4792000	4794000	After all, we are R&D people.
4794000	4796000	Yes.
4796000	4798000	Yes.
4798000	4800000	I think so.
4800000	4802000	We can talk more.
4802000	4804000	If you
4804000	4806000	think about investment,
4806000	4808000	it's about functional design.
4808000	4810000	I didn't cover it today.
4810000	4812000	But this part
4812000	4814000	I can share with you.
4814000	4816000	It might be useful.
4816000	4818000	Yes.
4818000	4820000	Thank you.
4820000	4822000	Thank you.
4822000	4824000	Thank you.
4824000	4826000	You're welcome.
4826000	4828000	Any questions?
4840000	4842000	If not,
4842000	4844000	let's
4844000	4846000	give
4846000	4848000	a round of applause
4848000	4850000	for Zhu Yi
4850000	4852000	to turn on
4852000	4854000	the microphone.
4854000	4856000	Thank you.
4856000	4858000	Thank you.
4858000	4860000	Thank you.
4860000	4862000	Thank you.
4862000	4864000	Thank you.
4864000	4866000	Thank you.
4866000	4868000	Thank you.
4868000	4870000	Thank you.
4870000	4872000	That's about it for today.
4872000	4874000	Some places
4874000	4876000	in the city
4876000	4878000	are getting close to bedtime.
4878000	4880000	Yes.
4880000	4882000	That's about it for today.
4882000	4884000	The recording
4884000	4886000	will be posted
4886000	4888000	on Facebook
4888000	4890000	in three to five days.
4890000	4892000	No, no.
4892000	4894000	It will be posted
4894000	4896000	on Project Terra's
4896000	4898000	presentation link.
4898000	4900000	If you want to review it,
4900000	4902000	you can go back and watch it.
4902000	4904000	Okay.
4904000	4906000	Thank you, Zhu Yi.
4906000	4908000	Thank you, Ted.
