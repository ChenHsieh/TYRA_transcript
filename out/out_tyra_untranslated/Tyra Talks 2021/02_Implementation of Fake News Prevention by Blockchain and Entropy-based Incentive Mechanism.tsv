0	15000	我們今天非常非常榮幸呢能請到建智來跟我們談談就是他在blockchain相關的研究
15000	21000	那在讓建智開始這個他的演講之前呢先讓我介紹一下建智
21000	28000	建智或是大家可以叫他Joseph是這個University of Waterloo的PhD student
28000	34000	他現在在的系所呢是Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty of Engineering
34000	39000	然後呢在他來到這個University of Waterloo之前呢
39000	44000	他曾經在台灣就是帶領銀行的新創銀行團隊呢
44000	51000	這個做這個Banking System的這個程式設計
51000	58000	然後呢他同時有Collaborate跟Microsoft Taiwan Collaborate就是相關就是Medical System的研究
58000	63000	那他的這個Doctoral Research主要是就是今天的主題Blockchain
63000	71000	然後呢他除此之外他也對比如說IoT Edge Computing Security還有AI都有涉獵而且是非常有興趣
71000	75000	那除此之外在這個主要研究之外呢
75000	82000	他同時也有Volunteer在Mentor台灣的學生參加就是
82000	86000	Sorry申請這個全世界的這個PhD Program
86000	89000	然後他也同時也有
89000	92000	Sorry我看一下喔
92000	95000	Sorry我中文英文翻譯有點問題
95000	97000	我只用英文唸好了
97000	107000	Volunteer to mentor new graduate student in his department and the Taiwan Global Ambassador of UW's Office of Advancement
107000	115000	然後呢他非常鼓勵台灣的學生可以跳出舒適圈追尋他們的夢想
115000	120000	好那我這邊先關掉
121000	125000	今天劍之要給我們帶來的演講題目是
125000	131000	An Implementation of Fake News Prevention by Blockchain and Entropy-Based Incentive Mechanism
131000	134000	那麻煩大家現在把麥克風打開
134000	137000	因為我們的麥克風現在預設是關掉的
137000	139000	先把麥克風全部打開
139000	143000	然後我們用熱烈的掌聲來歡迎我們今天的講者為我們帶來精彩的演講
144000	150000	好那交給你了
150000	152000	Thank you everyone
152000	154000	And thanks 劍勇
154000	158000	I originally thought I use the Chinese to give a speech
158000	162000	But I promised my English workshop to give an English presentation
162000	166000	So I still use English to give my presentation
166000	168000	But if you have any question
168000	171000	Feel free to ask in Chinese or English
171000	173000	Both are fine
173000	179000	So I'm so glad to give you this presentation
179000	185000	It's about we use blockchain technique to come back with the fake news
185000	187000	But before into the research
187000	193000	I would like to introduce my background and to let you understand me more
193000	202000	So this is my background
202000	204000	Actually I'm born in Taiwan
204000	208000	And when I graduated, I worked in Taiwan for several years
208000	214000	And as you can see, I originally in Hsinchu
214000	219000	And then I go back to Taipei and do some software development
219000	222000	And then I go to the banks
222000	224000	Issan Bank and China Trust
224000	226000	And then before I joined UW
226000	233000	I collaborated with Microsoft Taiwan as a technical consultant
233000	236000	And my educational background is that
236000	243000	I'm a computer science master degree in National Taiwan Ocean University
244000	251000	And for this part is that I introduced that in my master thesis
251000	255000	We developed some facial recognition system
255000	259000	That you could input the sentences and your image
259000	265000	And then our system could to generate animation like you
265000	269000	And this animation can say some sentences
269000	272000	So it's pretty interesting
272000	277000	And as you can see right now
277000	281000	A lot of application like this published very famous
281000	284000	So yeah, it's a life is a joke
284000	287000	If we put this product on the market
287000	290000	Maybe I'm a millionaire now, right?
290000	295000	And if I graduated and, you know, for engineering students
295000	301000	Seniors told you, you could go to the Hsinchu to get a job
301000	303000	And then you can get a lot of stocks
303000	305000	Then you can retire very soon
305000	307000	So it was my dream
307000	311000	So when I graduated, I went to Hsinchu
311000	317000	But, you know, in that year, we met some financial crisis
317000	327000	So I came back to Taipei to do software development
328000	334000	And at that time, I was very interested in mobile development
334000	337000	And in that generation, in that year
337000	343000	The Microsoft collaborated with the Nokia to deliver the new devices
343000	347000	That's the Nokia and the Windows phone on the market
347000	350000	So I joined one company
350000	355000	We as a manager and a team to develop some mobile apps
355000	359000	As you can see, yeah, the interesting one is the repost
359000	366000	We transfer the Nokia's games
366000	368000	It's a Barbie game, right?
368000	370000	If you're a child, you use this app
370000	375000	You can change the process of the app to us in this games
375000	381000	We transfer it from the iPhone and Android system to Windows phone
381000	384000	And then we do some application
384000	388000	We do some applications for, you know, the care, right?
388000	393000	And tool for the Taiwan taxi and also for the easy taxi
393000	398000	All these applications, I was so excited that I did this application
398000	403000	Because, you know, in apps, if you are a programmer
403000	408000	The apps could give you a very straightforward feedback from customers
408000	410000	So it's very interesting
411000	417000	However, the life gave me another joke
417000	424000	Is that the Windows phone did not succeed at that time
424000	429000	So, yeah, after I did this job for more than one year
429000	433000	I found that, yeah, no, this job cannot help me to
433000	437000	Enough money for me to buy, yeah
437000	443000	So I joined to banks and to run the directives
443000	446000	Some financial products and we built a system
446000	448000	It's called the Muiris
448000	451000	And this Muiris is a very powerful system
451000	453000	At the banking operations
453000	455000	If you are a trader, you could use this system
455000	460000	To record any financial products in this system
460000	466000	And all the Taiwan, the first tier, the banks use this system
466000	468000	So I went to China Trust
468000	472000	And then I went to Hunter
472000	476000	Invite me to join Yishan Bank to introduce Muiris to their banks
476000	479000	And then when I finished this Muiris project
479000	483000	Yeah, we made a big project in Taiwan
483000	488000	Is that the Asian Pacific Organization came to Taiwan
488000	493000	They do some resource to how does Taiwan do
494000	498000	In the anti-money laundry, which is a fine system
498000	502000	And so when I, I was kidding that
502000	506000	So, yeah, I'm one of the Taiwan representative
506000	508000	The national teams in Taiwan is very honored for us
508000	511000	But it's really tough to do that
511000	514000	We need to finish it out of the requirements in a very short time
514000	517000	But, yeah, the final result is very good
517000	522000	And I also got a promotion in Yishan Bank
522000	525000	So far, it looks so good
525000	530000	So why I want to go study abroad
530000	533000	That's because that I was thinking about that
533000	537000	If I still stay in Taiwan, right
537000	542000	Maybe I could gather good jobs and to be promoted
542000	544000	Continue to be promoted
544000	548000	But, yeah, I was very
548000	554000	I heard about some great new technology skills
554000	557000	Or some new products from Silicon Valley
557000	559000	Or from North America
559000	564000	So it was always be my dream to study abroad
564000	567000	So I was so hesitate
567000	574000	But, yeah, I just to give myself a chance to do this
574000	579000	And so right now I was thinking about that
579000	582000	The thing is that if you have a dream
582000	585000	It only could stop you, it's just yourself
585000	590000	So I just want to encourage all of my friends
590000	596000	Or the participants or some young students in this meeting
596000	599000	You could to just to check your dreams
599000	603000	Or not to limit yourself
604000	607000	And so right now I'm here in Canada
607000	612000	So I saw a lot of beautiful things
612000	616000	But, yeah, the period is also
616000	619000	When I prepare for this study process
619000	621000	I met a lot of difficulties
621000	626000	But, yeah, it's worth it, I think
626000	629000	And, yeah, this is my
629000	630000	A lot of my motto is that
631000	633000	Actually adventure may hurt you
633000	638000	But monotony, which means that you always do the same things
638000	642000	It will kill you, kill you creative or other things
642000	645000	So, yeah, that's all my background introduction
645000	649000	So I will stop here for a while
649000	652000	If you have any question, you could ask me right now
660000	671000	OK, I think you have any question
671000	676000	Feel free to ask me and we can discuss more
676000	681000	And so I wrote some of my experiences in my blog
681000	683000	And some medium if you have
683000	686000	You could check it and to get more detail
686000	689000	If you also want to trust your dreams
689000	691000	Or you have some dream career
691000	696000	Or you could also find me on those pages
696000	701000	And, yeah, we could discuss more about your passion
701000	707000	And, OK, so let's get to our main research topic today
707000	710000	Today we're going to talk about
710000	716000	How to use the blockchain to prevent the fake news
716000	718000	Yeah, actually what is the fake news
718000	723000	It is a complete fabrication
723000	727000	Which means people to forge something
727000	729000	Or to mimic something
729000	731000	And they're very similar to the real
731000	735000	You are not able to confirm what the fact is
735000	739000	What is the real, what is the fact
739000	741000	And so what is the
741000	745000	Actually the spread of fake news
745000	748000	Is not in the long future
748000	749000	It happens right now
749000	751000	You could see this slide
751000	754000	In the left-hand upside
754000	756000	Is the U.S. stock market
756000	758000	In one day you could see the picture
758000	760000	It drops sharply
760000	761000	But why
761000	763000	Because at that day
763000	767000	The news says that the Trumps
767000	770000	The Obama was dead
770000	772000	But it's a rumor, right
772000	777000	But however the stock market to drop very sharply
777000	779000	By this fake news
779000	781000	And other examples in this slide
781000	784000	We all know that the Cambridge Analytic
784000	787000	They collect the users' preferences
787000	791000	And to make some news or articles
791000	793000	That you are interested in
793000	798000	And to affect your opinion in some specific issues
798000	800000	And also the Russian
800000	804000	They use some propagandas to affect the basis
804000	806000	The resource of basis
806000	810000	So all these are the current threat
810000	816000	To our society and democracy and the economy
816000	818000	Also in Taiwan
818000	819000	Taiwan is the same
819000	821000	Actually in the research
821000	824000	Taiwan is the most
824000	828000	We got the most threat from the whole world
828000	829000	We are number one
829000	830000	So it's very
830000	831000	Like I said
831000	832000	It's not a long
832000	834000	Not a threat in a long distance
834000	836000	It's the current
836000	841000	It happened currently right now
841000	846000	So why people invest in fake news
846000	850000	That is because they can get a lot of revenues
850000	853000	Based on the lower cost
853000	858000	Right now the cost of producing the fake news
858000	859000	It's very cheap
859000	862000	But if you can affect a big topic
862000	866000	Like the U.S. president election
866000	869000	Or some very huge topic
869000	872000	You could get a huge, huge revenues
872000	874000	So why not
874000	875000	Why don't we do that
875000	881000	If I can impact a lot of people
881000	884000	By very low cost
884000	888000	Actually the malicious people
888000	893000	Of course they will do that
893000	898000	And also the AI technology makes things worse
898000	902000	Because in my this slide
902000	905000	This is Jordan Peele
905000	908000	He is a U.S. actor
908000	913000	He collaborated with technology companies
913000	917000	They use the AI technique to
917000	921000	The deep fake technique to produce the video
921000	924000	And to let Obama to say some words
924000	926000	They want him to say
926000	928000	So AI make the fake news
928000	932000	To be produced more easier
932000	934000	And so
934000	937000	But in a traditional ways
937000	940000	Our research mainly focus on
941000	945000	To detect the fake news automatically
945000	947000	How we do that
947000	949000	You see this picture that
949000	951000	We have different algorithms
951000	954000	But mainly we use some machine learning algorithms
954000	957000	We find some clues
957000	961000	For example if you are the fake news comes in
961000	966000	And we find whether the IP address is correct or not
966000	969000	And its content has some
969000	971000	We use this or not
971000	974000	So we use some patterns to detect
974000	977000	And to decide whether this fake news is
977000	980000	Whether this news is correct or not
980000	981000	But like I said
981000	985000	AI makes things very similar to real
985000	989000	The algorithms does not have
989000	994000	Have the great performance right now
994000	998000	So some big companies like Google
998000	1000000	Or Facebook
1000000	1003000	They begin to use some
1003000	1006000	Human beings power capabilities to
1006000	1009000	Help AI to check the contents
1009000	1011000	Authenticity
1011000	1012000	How they do that
1012000	1014000	They build some teams
1014000	1017000	They collaborate with the local professions
1017000	1020000	They have the ability to check the content
1020000	1024000	Is correct or not
1024000	1026000	And Facebook also did the same things
1026000	1030000	They built a team internal
1030000	1033000	And those teams will check some news
1033000	1035000	The authenticity
1035000	1038000	And to make your
1038000	1040000	Some news
1040000	1043000	When news push to your device
1043000	1044000	They will be real
1044000	1051000	And they will build some fake news
1051000	1052000	And in Taiwan
1052000	1055000	We also have one organization
1055000	1057000	And you could see that
1057000	1061000	It's the Taiwan Fact Check Center
1061000	1064000	And you could go on their website
1064000	1065000	And to see
1065000	1066000	They could check
1066000	1068000	They will check some news
1068000	1075000	And tell you this is correct or incorrect
1075000	1076000	OK
1076000	1080000	So I stop here
1080000	1083000	And for these solutions
1083000	1086000	Like Google or Facebook
1086000	1089000	Or the Taiwan Fact Check Center
1089000	1090000	Those are good solutions
1090000	1097000	But these solutions are
1097000	1100000	Are managed by a central organization
1100000	1103000	We don't know how they work
1103000	1106000	It's like a black box
1106000	1110000	If they did not do this job well
1110000	1112000	You did not know right
1112000	1116000	You just can trust them
1116000	1118000	So in our solution
1118000	1123000	We used decentralized solutions
1123000	1128000	Which means that we will form a team
1128000	1129000	Form a call
1129000	1131000	A lot of people
1131000	1133000	They are advisors
1133000	1135000	They will verify some contents
1135000	1139000	But this solution does not manage
1139000	1141000	By only one company
1141000	1144000	It's managed by everyone
1144000	1146000	Who joined this system
1146000	1148000	So this is our paper
1148000	1152000	And just accepted by DTN
1152000	1154000	2021 in November
1154000	1157000	So after the meeting
1157000	1159000	If you have more interesting details
1159000	1160000	You could
1160000	1161000	But it's not published yet
1161000	1163000	Maybe in December
1163000	1164000	So in December
1164000	1166000	You could check this content
1166000	1167000	In more detail
1171000	1172000	Ok so
1172000	1175000	I think we can get into the detail
1175000	1177000	So for
1177000	1181000	This work is from another paper
1181000	1186000	That invented by some researchers
1186000	1188000	In the UK
1188000	1189000	As you can see
1189000	1194000	In the middle of this architecture
1194000	1196000	There is a group
1196000	1198000	That we call the uprising actors
1198000	1200000	These are some professions
1200000	1202000	They have ability to check
1202000	1204000	The content is correct or not
1204000	1205000	And in that side
1205000	1208000	When the content creator
1208000	1210000	Is the content creators
1210000	1212000	Are people who create
1212000	1215000	The digital content
1215000	1216000	Maybe you are a writer
1216000	1218000	Or you are a photographer
1218000	1220000	And you make some content
1220000	1222000	And you could send your content
1222000	1224000	Into our system
1224000	1227000	And then those uprising actors
1227000	1230000	Will verify your content to check
1230000	1234000	Or your content is real or fake
1234000	1237000	And then they will send back to you
1237000	1238000	The uprising result
1238000	1240000	Then those uprising result
1240000	1242000	Will be saved in the
1242000	1244000	Blockchain network
1244000	1245000	After that
1245000	1247000	The right-hand side users
1247000	1249000	When it comes into our system
1249000	1251000	They could check the
1251000	1253000	Authenticity of the contents
1253000	1256000	From our blockchain network
1257000	1260000	So that's an overview
1260000	1263000	Architecture of the system
1263000	1264000	Our system's architecture
1264000	1267000	Is similar to this architecture
1267000	1270000	But in the following slide
1270000	1271000	I will introduce the differences
1271000	1275000	Between architecture and this
1277000	1280000	And this is interesting
1280000	1283000	Like I said
1284000	1286000	If we all rely on
1286000	1287000	Facebook or Google
1287000	1290000	To help us to check the content
1290000	1291000	How do I know
1291000	1295000	They do their job very well
1295000	1297000	Maybe they just have to
1297000	1299000	They did not do very seriously
1299000	1304000	So I still could still see some fake news
1304000	1306000	But in this system
1306000	1309000	You could to select the people
1309000	1312000	Or some authorities media
1312000	1314000	You trust
1314000	1315000	And then to get them
1315000	1318000	To be your oppressing actors
1318000	1320000	So for example
1320000	1322000	If in this case
1322000	1324000	I selected
1324000	1326000	One is the BBC
1326000	1329000	It's a media
1329000	1332000	And I also selected some people
1332000	1334000	Professor Smith or Mr. John
1334000	1338000	Maybe some celebrities you trust
1338000	1341000	If they say this news is real
1341000	1343000	You will trust that
1343000	1345000	So maybe for example in Taiwan
1345000	1347000	Maybe you are very
1347000	1349000	Trustful
1349000	1352000	If he say this news is real
1352000	1354000	Okay, I will trust him
1354000	1356000	So you could select these people
1356000	1359000	To be your trusted parties
1359000	1362000	And when the news comes in
1362000	1366000	We will call your call
1366000	1369000	A group of oppressing actors
1369000	1371000	They will give you the opinion
1371000	1379000	But is this news is correct or not
1379000	1380000	And so but
1380000	1383000	Why we need to use the blockchain
1383000	1385000	In the system
1385000	1386000	Why don't we just use
1386000	1388000	The traditional databases
1388000	1391000	We just accept the oppressing results
1391000	1394000	We don't need to use the blockchain, right
1394000	1395000	But actually blockchain
1395000	1398000	Has some characteristic
1398000	1400000	That if once your data
1400000	1402000	Is accepted in blockchain
1402000	1403000	You cannot modify that
1403000	1406000	Because everyone has one ledger
1406000	1407000	In their node
1407000	1410000	Is this not possible
1410000	1413000	To modify all the ledgers, right
1413000	1415000	And another case is that
1415000	1419000	If you modify the ledger
1419000	1420000	In only one node
1420000	1422000	It will be easier to be fine
1422000	1425000	Because we have some
1425000	1427000	Hashtag
1427000	1428000	In computer science
1428000	1430000	The hashpoint is that
1430000	1432000	For example, in my node
1432000	1435000	I have a hashpoint to point to your node
1435000	1437000	But if you modify
1437000	1440000	The hashpoint is based on your content
1440000	1441000	If you modify the content
1441000	1443000	The hashpoint will be modified
1443000	1446000	So it will be easier to be found that
1446000	1449000	Somebody modified the data
1449000	1453000	So blockchain will be a great solution
1453000	1456000	To maintain the correctness of the data
1457000	1461000	And we go back to give you some knowledge
1461000	1463000	How does the blockchain work
1463000	1465000	Actually you can see this picture
1465000	1468000	And if you have a transaction
1468000	1470000	In this system
1470000	1474000	And the nodes will compete
1474000	1477000	To try to verify it
1477000	1480000	And once this data verified
1480000	1483000	You will be set to the blockchain
1483000	1485000	That is in a button
1485000	1487000	We have some red blocks
1487000	1492000	And they are picked by the hashpoint
1492000	1493000	Right
1493000	1498000	So this is how the blockchain works
1498000	1500000	And then it's just
1500000	1503000	There are many, many blockchains right now
1503000	1507000	So it's a very simple classification
1507000	1509000	One is the public
1509000	1511000	And another is the private
1511000	1513000	Public means that everyone
1513000	1516000	And could to send a transaction
1516000	1519000	In this blockchain network
1519000	1521000	Like bitcoin
1521000	1523000	People know about bitcoin and all
1523000	1526000	But in private blockchain
1526000	1528000	Only people approved
1528000	1530000	Will be can send the transaction
1530000	1532000	Into the system
1532000	1536000	And so this private blockchain
1536000	1538000	Often be used in the corporations
1538000	1541000	Not for the public
1541000	1544000	And yeah so
1544000	1545000	And another
1545000	1547000	Since you need to know in blockchain
1547000	1549000	Is the proof of work
1549000	1552000	And proof of stake
1552000	1553000	What is proof of work
1553000	1556000	It means that
1556000	1557000	If we have a transaction
1557000	1559000	And we have a lot of nodes
1559000	1561000	Which node can record
1561000	1564000	This data into blockchain
1564000	1568000	And if you are proof of work mechanism
1568000	1569000	The nodes will compete
1569000	1572000	To solve a complicated math problem
1572000	1573000	And this process
1573000	1575000	We call it the mining
1575000	1577000	Right so it's a famous word
1577000	1579000	Or it's very popular to be heard
1579000	1581000	If you solve this problem
1581000	1583000	Then you get the right
1583000	1586000	To set data into blockchain
1586000	1588000	But yeah and the proof of work
1588000	1590000	Is right now the blockchain
1590000	1593000	And the ethereum used
1593000	1595000	And the proof of stake is that
1595000	1597000	Oh no we don't
1597000	1598000	To solve the math problem
1598000	1600000	We just use some stake
1600000	1601000	What does that mean
1601000	1602000	Is that if you want to
1602000	1604000	Record data into blockchain
1604000	1607000	You need to pay some fees
1607000	1609000	And if you pay higher
1609000	1611000	You will be get higher chance
1611000	1613000	To get the right
1613000	1614000	To be selected to get the right
1614000	1617000	To set data into blockchain
1617000	1619000	So these two solutions
1619000	1625000	Are called resist the hackers
1625000	1627000	Because in the proof of work
1627000	1629000	We want to control
1629000	1631000	Our right to record data
1631000	1632000	In blockchain
1632000	1634000	You need to control
1634000	1639000	More than 51% computers in the world
1639000	1642000	And in proof of stake
1642000	1646000	You need to pay more than 51% stakes
1646000	1647000	Then you will get the right
1647000	1652000	To record data
1652000	1654000	And then so you can see that
1655000	1658000	In blockchain actually
1658000	1660000	I think people heard about
1660000	1661000	One news is in Taiwan
1661000	1663000	That one day some people
1663000	1666000	Buy a lottery right
1666000	1670000	Then they collect a lot of people
1670000	1673000	People to buy the lottery together
1673000	1676000	But one man denied
1676000	1677000	He denied that
1677000	1680000	Said oh no this lottery
1680000	1682000	Only belongs to me
1682000	1683000	But if you use blockchain
1683000	1685000	The solution the problem
1685000	1687000	Will not exist
1687000	1689000	Because in blockchain
1689000	1690000	Everything will
1690000	1692000	Very transparency
1692000	1693000	And we could trust
1693000	1695000	Who did the transaction
1695000	1698000	So that's the one
1698000	1699000	The blockchain could support
1699000	1700000	Our daily life
1700000	1702000	Actually they can solve
1702000	1703000	A lot of things
1703000	1704000	Like if you're trying to vote in
1704000	1707000	Or to test some
1707000	1711000	The fishery or some products
1711000	1713000	The original prices of the product
1713000	1717000	By using a blockchain
1717000	1719000	And then in this system
1719000	1722000	You could
1722000	1723000	I would like to introduce
1723000	1724000	The hyperledger fabric
1724000	1726000	It's the blockchain that
1726000	1728000	Proposed by IBM
1728000	1731000	And this is the permission
1731000	1733000	Private blockchain that I said
1733000	1735000	It's for the companies
1735000	1738000	Not for the public
1738000	1742000	And how they work
1742000	1743000	You could see this flow
1743000	1745000	If you have a transaction
1745000	1746000	You could propose to
1746000	1748000	The execution chain code
1748000	1751000	The chain code is the smart contract
1751000	1753000	In the blockchain network
1753000	1754000	I think people will
1754000	1756000	Heard about smart contract
1756000	1758000	Often very often
1758000	1760000	And then the smart contract
1760000	1762000	Will check your content
1762000	1765000	To check is there any mistake
1765000	1766000	In your content
1766000	1768000	And then send back to you
1768000	1770000	And when you get a permission
1770000	1771000	You can send your
1771000	1772000	Submit your transaction
1772000	1774000	To the ordering services
1774000	1775000	And then the ordering services
1775000	1777000	Will to decide
1777000	1779000	How to record your data
1779000	1781000	Into the blockchain
1781000	1785000	And it's different to the bitcoin
1785000	1786000	The hyperledger fabric
1786000	1787000	Does not use the
1787000	1792000	Proof of work mechanism
1792000	1793000	Which means that
1793000	1795000	Then we don't need to spend
1795000	1798000	A lot of energy or money
1798000	1801000	To do the mining process
1801000	1802000	So it will be faster
1802000	1805000	And save energy
1805000	1807000	Than the blockchain
1807000	1811000	Than the bitcoin
1811000	1813000	So for this
1813000	1815000	In our paper
1815000	1817000	This is our main architecture
1817000	1819000	The main difference is that
1819000	1820000	You could see that
1820000	1823000	In the data persistent layer
1823000	1824000	Our blockchain
1824000	1826000	We use the hyperledger fabric
1826000	1828000	But in a previous work
1828000	1830000	That did not mention that
1830000	1832000	Which blockchain they used
1832000	1834000	Also we
1834000	1837000	How do you incentive
1837000	1841000	To let the oppressing actors
1841000	1842000	To do things well
1842000	1845000	We invented incentive mechanisms
1845000	1847000	To that people
1847000	1849000	Willing to do things very well
1849000	1853000	Not to produce some dishonest
1853000	1857000	Behaviors
1857000	1860000	And then our system will
1860000	1861000	Tell you that
1861000	1862000	If you send
1862000	1863000	The content creator
1863000	1865000	Send one content into our system
1865000	1867000	Our system will tell you
1867000	1870000	How much percent
1870000	1873000	This content is real or fake
1873000	1875000	Like this slide shows
1875000	1876000	The content is the
1876000	1878000	66% is real
1878000	1880000	And 80% is fake
1880000	1882000	And this opinion is from
1882000	1884000	The people you trust
1884000	1885000	In your trust list
1885000	1888000	So you could use this
1888000	1890000	Oppressing result to judge
1890000	1896000	This news is fake or not
1896000	1898000	And so this is our main floor
1898000	1901000	And we
1901000	1903000	We was
1903000	1905000	We refer to the history and that
1905000	1906000	In the beginning
1906000	1908000	Our system will accept
1908000	1911000	The participant to add some
1911000	1913000	So they will get
1913000	1914000	Some credit point
1914000	1915000	And then they can use the
1915000	1917000	Credit point to
1917000	1919000	Do some oppressing
1919000	1922000	And then we can get a trust score
1922000	1924000	And then
1924000	1925000	When we get a trust score
1925000	1926000	So we could
1926000	1927000	For example
1927000	1929000	In the previous
1929000	1931000	This example
1931000	1933000	Most of the majority thinks that
1933000	1935000	This content is real
1935000	1938000	So the minority
1938000	1939000	Why this minority
1939000	1940000	Think this content
1940000	1941000	Is fake
1941000	1944000	So our system will give reward
1944000	1946000	To those people
1946000	1948000	That are
1948000	1950000	Belongs to the majority
1950000	1952000	And to get the punishment
1952000	1954000	To people who are in the minority
1954000	1955000	Right
1955000	1957000	Because
1957000	1958000	All people are professions
1958000	1961000	Why you think this
1961000	1964000	Content is fake
1964000	1965000	Not correct
1965000	1969000	Not similar to the majority's opinion
1970000	1972000	And then before I get into
1972000	1974000	How to calculate the trust score
1974000	1977000	I want to introduce one concept
1977000	1978000	Is that
1978000	1980000	We call it entropy
1980000	1982000	And
1982000	1983000	Yeah, don't
1983000	1985000	Don't think it too complicated
1985000	1987000	I don't want to
1987000	1989000	Introduce some to
1989000	1991000	Academia or some to top
1991000	1992000	Concept
1992000	1994000	You can only see that
1994000	1996000	This concept is from the
1996000	1997000	Chemistry
1997000	1998000	And from
1998000	1999000	Yeah
1999000	2000000	Example is that
2000000	2003000	If you have a glass of water
2003000	2005000	And you put ink into water
2005000	2006000	The water will
2006000	2008000	The ink will
2008000	2009000	From one point
2009000	2011000	And will spread to everywhere
2011000	2012000	Right
2012000	2015000	So entropy is to
2015000	2017000	Measure this phenomena
2017000	2019000	All the things
2019000	2023000	Is it a disorder or not
2023000	2025000	If the entropy is high
2025000	2026000	Because
2026000	2027000	It means that
2027000	2032000	The things is more disorder
2032000	2034000	I could put here
2034000	2036000	And so
2036000	2037000	In this slide
2037000	2038000	You could see that
2038000	2039000	The red point
2039000	2042000	Is really, really similar to
2042000	2043000	You could imagine that
2043000	2045000	The one red point is one people
2045000	2048000	If their opinion are the same
2048000	2050000	It's just like the low entropy, right
2050000	2051000	They will
2051000	2053000	Stay together very closely
2053000	2056000	But if their opinion divergent
2056000	2058000	They will have high entropy, right
2058000	2063000	So their opinion will not the same
2063000	2064000	So
2064000	2065000	I will continue
2065000	2067000	Begin to tell you
2067000	2070000	How we calculate the trust score
2070000	2072000	And I will put some equations there
2072000	2074000	But you don't need to
2074000	2076000	To look very detail into equations
2076000	2079000	You just need to look at the numbers
2079000	2080000	Okay
2080000	2082000	But for this example
2082000	2084000	If we have five prices
2084000	2086000	And three of them agree
2086000	2088000	And two of them reject
2088000	2090000	So we could get that
2090000	2094000	The possibility of real
2094000	2096000	Is three divided by
2096000	2098000	Based on
2098000	2101000	This is the possibility
2101000	2103000	And this is three
2103000	2105000	Divide five, so it's 0.5
2105000	2108000	And p fact will be two
2108000	2111000	Divided five will be 0.4
2111000	2112000	And then we put this
2112000	2115000	The p real and p fact into this equation
2115000	2118000	Then we can get the entropy for this case
2118000	2121000	Will be 0.70
2121000	2122000	Okay
2122000	2124000	Just remember the number
2124000	2126000	And
2126000	2128000	Another case is that if we have
2128000	2130000	The four prices agree
2130000	2132000	Only one
2132000	2134000	Reject
2134000	2136000	You could get that
2136000	2139000	In this case, the people have the
2139000	2141000	More consistent opinion, right
2141000	2143000	So the entropy will lower
2143000	2146000	And in the example one
2146000	2147000	The entropy is higher
2147000	2150000	So our system encourage people to
2150000	2153000	Let their opinion consistent
2153000	2157000	So when the high
2157000	2161000	High entropy, our reward or
2161000	2163000	Punishment
2163000	2165000	Will lower
2165000	2167000	But in the
2167000	2169000	In the example two
2169000	2171000	Our reward and the punishment
2171000	2176000	Will be higher
2176000	2179000	So I will give you a table
2179000	2181000	And to show you how we calculate
2181000	2182000	The trust score
2182000	2184000	And so
2184000	2186000	If you remember the metaphor
2186000	2188000	I said before
2188000	2189000	In the beginning
2189000	2192000	This is of five people
2192000	2193000	And
2193000	2195000	Yeah, they have some opinions
2195000	2198000	In the specific news
2198000	2201000	And their initial stakes is that
2201000	2203000	A1 put 5000
2203000	2205000	Into the system
2205000	2207000	A2 put 1000
2207000	2210000	And then the total stakes is the 21000
2210000	2213000	And you could get the
2213000	2215000	The credit point or appraiser
2215000	2218000	And there is the 5000
2218000	2220000	To divide the 21000
2220000	2222000	So we could get the
2222000	2225000	Each appraiser's credit point
2225000	2226000	Of
2226000	2228000	Credit point of appraiser
2228000	2229000	Right
2229000	2232000	So it's just a simple
2232000	2236000	Simple math
2236000	2237000	Okay, so
2237000	2239000	We right now we have
2239000	2240000	Know how the
2240000	2242000	Credit point
2242000	2243000	Of the appraiser
2243000	2245000	And then
2245000	2246000	When they get
2246000	2248000	When the appraiser get opinion to the content
2248000	2249000	They could say that
2249000	2252000	Oh, I'm 100%
2252000	2255000	Sure that this news is fake
2256000	2258000	Or real or fake
2258000	2261000	But like A2
2261000	2263000	He could also say that
2263000	2268000	Oh, this content is a little bit tough for me to judge
2268000	2273000	So I just have the 70% confidence
2273000	2275000	That it is true
2275000	2277000	So our trust score
2277000	2280000	Will be the CPOA
2280000	2282000	To multiply the confidence
2282000	2284000	So you could see that
2284000	2288000	This SOA is the score of authentic
2288000	2290000	Is the all people agrees
2290000	2292000	And their SOA
2292000	2296000	The summation of the all the SOA
2296000	2299000	And here is the sum score of fake
2299000	2305000	Is the same as the score of authentic
2305000	2307000	And we also summation
2307000	2309000	All the people disagree
2309000	2311000	And the summation their SOA
2311000	2313000	To get the final result
2314000	2316000	So that's the trust
2316000	2318000	How we calculate the trust score
2321000	2323000	And then when we know the trust score
2323000	2326000	Like I said, our system will decide
2327000	2333000	Will reflect the reward or punishment to each appraisers
2333000	2336000	And we define that our basic reward
2336000	2340000	Is the total stake to modify the 0.1%
2340000	2342000	So in this case
2342000	2343000	Will be 21
2343000	2346000	And the basic punishment will be higher
2346000	2347000	More higher than the reward
2347000	2352000	Because we want to stop the malicious nodes
2352000	2355000	So the basic punishment will be total stake
2355000	2357000	Multiply the 10%
2357000	2361000	So it will be the 2100
2361000	2364000	And then the reward of the content
2364000	2368000	Which means that when once content comes in
2369000	2371000	And how many reward
2371000	2374000	We will reflect to all the appraisers
2374000	2376000	Who did their jobs
2376000	2379000	So our equation will be
2380000	2383000	We use the basic reward to modify
2383000	2388000	The value of the 1 to minus the entropy S
2388000	2391000	So you could see that in this case
2391000	2397000	We know that in our example 1
2397000	2401000	Our entropy is 0.97
2401000	2408000	So the ROC or POC will be 6.3 and 6.3 respectively
2412000	2413000	Okay
2414000	2418000	So then we know that the basic reward
2418000	2422000	And we know the reward of content
2422000	2424000	And the punishment of content
2424000	2427000	And how we reflect to each appraiser
2427000	2432000	And we will calculate the ratio of SOA
2432000	2433000	Which means that
2435000	2439000	For example, in SOA, we have the 0.66
2439000	2442000	And for A1, we will know that
2442000	2448000	There are 36% of the trust score
2449000	2452000	The score of authentic is come from
2452000	2455000	Is come from the appraiser 1
2455000	2458000	So we will use this ratio to reflect
2458000	2462000	The reward to each appraiser
2462000	2465000	And for the punishment is the same
2465000	2467000	We will know that
2467000	2472000	How you contribute to the trust of the fake
2472000	2475000	And then if you contribute
2475000	2478000	Or you occupy more percentage
2478000	2481000	You will get more reward or more punishment
2481000	2486000	Okay
2486000	2489000	So in here, you can see
2489000	2492000	We calculate the ratio of ROC and the ratio of POC
2492000	2496000	Which each appraiser need to be reflected
2496000	2499000	It will be added or be reduced
2499000	2503000	And then when we reflect it
2503000	2506000	You can see that for, for example, in for A1
2506000	2510000	The initial, its initial state is 5,000
2510000	2515000	And after state is the 5,000 point 23
2515000	2518000	So we could get all the after states
2518000	2521000	And then we can calculate the after credit point
2521000	2523000	So this is a cycle
2523000	2527000	When every content, when we finish the appraising process
2527000	2532000	We will have the new states and the new credit point
2532000	2536000	And then they will get ready to accept another content
2537000	2540000	And if any appraiser
2540000	2543000	Their credit point is close to zero
2543000	2545000	Which means that their stakes are heavy
2545000	2549000	They got a lot of the punishment
2549000	2550000	And their credit point
2550000	2552000	Their stakes is equal to zero
2552000	2555000	And we will go back to our main flow
2555000	2558000	The initial process that to accept
2558000	2562000	To ask this appraiser
2563000	2565000	Do you need to add more stakes
2565000	2571000	To continue to be the appraiser
2571000	2573000	So that's how
2573000	2576000	So we only finish the
2576000	2581000	I think that the most difficult part in our presentation
2581000	2583000	Is to calculate the trust score
2583000	2588000	And in this slide that we do some experiments
2588000	2590000	That to improve
2590000	2593000	To prove that our system could be a scale
2593000	2596000	On a lot of the users
2596000	2597000	You could see that
2597000	2598000	And in the left side
2598000	2601000	The picture shows that our system could
2601000	2603000	In our testing environment
2603000	2606000	We use the four servers
2606000	2611000	And the throughput is still goes well
2611000	2613000	But in our system
2613000	2614000	We set the contents
2614000	2619000	The maxima of the content is the eight megabytes
2619000	2620000	Because you could imagine
2620000	2624000	If we compress the content
2624000	2626000	For videos or some
2626000	2628000	We use the in-camera size
2628000	2630000	There is the technique
2630000	2632000	You could use the content to
2632000	2633000	As the input
2633000	2634000	And we have the output
2634000	2637000	It's a very short
2637000	2640000	Screen or some contents
2640000	2644000	And it will not to occupy a lot of size
2644000	2647000	So our limitation of the content
2647000	2649000	Would be the eight megabytes
2649000	2651000	And the right-hand side
2651000	2653000	The picture shows that
2653000	2657000	We all know that the computer system
2657000	2659000	Is rely on the fault tolerance
2659000	2660000	Which means that
2660000	2663000	If the main server fails
2663000	2666000	Our systems should still work well
2666000	2668000	You could see that
2668000	2670000	For example, you put a Facebook
2670000	2672000	One server crashed down
2672000	2674000	And you cannot use the Facebook
2674000	2675000	It's not good
2675000	2677000	So this is the right-hand side
2677000	2679000	The picture shows that
2679000	2683000	If we make some server failure
2683000	2686000	Our system still could work well
2686000	2694000	And the latency will not to increase very much
2694000	2699000	Okay, so I think we can get into conclusion
2699000	2701000	So yeah, so our system
2701000	2704000	I asked to summarize some take-home points
2704000	2706000	For all of you
2706000	2709000	Yeah, as you remember that
2709000	2712000	I've said that the AI technique
2712000	2714000	Is getting better and better
2714000	2717000	So the traditional algorithms
2717000	2720000	Does not get the great performance
2720000	2723000	To detect the fake news automatic
2723000	2726000	So if we use the human's capabilities
2726000	2728000	We will have a better solution
2728000	2733000	Than the traditional AI algorithms
2733000	2735000	But of course we could combine
2735000	2738000	The advantage for the AI algorithms
2738000	2740000	And the human-based capability
2740000	2743000	For example, we can use AI technique
2743000	2747000	To build the first layer of filters
2747000	2749000	And people can get into
2749000	2751000	To check the results, right
2751000	2752000	But the most important part
2752000	2755000	Is the blockchain network
2755000	2756000	Because it's decentralized
2756000	2760000	Not to manage it by only one companies
2760000	2762000	It's transparency
2762000	2765000	And very easier to find some data
2765000	2767000	It's being modified
2767000	2769000	And so in this experience
2769000	2772000	We know that our system
2772000	2774000	Is the architecture is peaceful
2774000	2776000	And we could
2776000	2779000	It has potential to be deployed
2779000	2781000	In thousands of machines
2781000	2784000	And the most important part
2784000	2787000	Is that our incentive mechanism
2787000	2789000	Offers this architecture
2789000	2791000	Commercial potential
2791000	2793000	You could imagine that to
2793000	2794000	If you are a writer
2794000	2796000	Or you are a photographer
2796000	2798000	You could use our system
2798000	2801000	To get some proof
2801000	2803000	That your content is real
2803000	2805000	And your reputation
2805000	2807000	Will getting better, right
2807000	2809000	And you are a journalist
2809000	2811000	Or you are some
2811000	2815000	If people doing a fact checking
2815000	2818000	And you can get reward from our system
2818000	2820000	So there is also
2820000	2822000	Then this will have
2822000	2824000	Get some commercial proof
2824000	2826000	And for building
2826000	2827000	This is the
2827000	2829000	Fact News Precision Systems
2832000	2833000	Okay
2833000	2835000	So that's for
2835000	2837000	It's a long presentation
2837000	2838000	So I'll stop here
2838000	2840000	And I'll tell you here
2840000	2843000	Is that this research is
2843000	2845000	Supported by Ripple

2856000	2857000	Okay
2857000	2858000	And also thanks my mentor
2858000	2860000	To give me
2860000	2862000	A lot of suggestions
2862000	2864000	And help when I
2864000	2866000	Study for and to
2866000	2869000	Find some research ideas
2869000	2871000	Or some
2871000	2874000	Know more people how to do well
2874000	2876000	In a PhD program
2876000	2879000	So I will introduce
2879000	2880000	Her Facebook
2880000	2882000	And

2886000	2889000	Study for or you have some
2889000	2891000	If you are women
2891000	2893000	That is the best
2893000	2895000	Facebook for you to check
2895000	2896000	So I put it here
2896000	2897000	And I want to thank
2897000	2899000	Catherine to be my mentor
2899000	2901000	And give me more
2901000	2903000	Help
2904000	2906000	Okay, so
2906000	2908000	That's all the presentation
2908000	2910000	And if you have a question
2910000	2912000	You could ask me right now
2912000	2915000	Or after the presentation
2915000	2917000	You could also drop me a mail
2917000	2919000	Or find me on
2919000	2921000	Or also
2921000	2923000	We will discuss with you
2923000	2925000	More detail or any questions you have
2925000	2928000	Yeah, thank you so much
2928000	2929000	So yeah, actually
2929000	2932000	So before we start our Q&A session
2932000	2935000	Please turn on your microphones again
2935000	2937000	So let's thank
2937000	2941000	Jianzhi for the very interesting talk
2941000	2943000	Thank you, thank you
2943000	2946000	Okay, so
2946000	2948000	I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that
2948000	2950000	Some of our attendees
2950000	2952000	Would like to ask in Mandarin Chinese
2952000	2954000	Probably, I guess
2954000	2956000	But, I mean, any kind of language
2956000	2957000	As long as you can communicate
2957000	2958000	That will all be fine
2958000	2960000	So, yeah
2960000	2962000	I'm happy to ask questions
2962000	2965000	Anyone?
2965000	2967000	Hello, hi
2967000	2969000	I'm Shanna
2969000	2970000	And I would like to know
2970000	2971000	Because I noticed that
2971000	2973000	Actually you have no experience
2973000	2974000	Studying abroad, right?
2974000	2976000	This is your first time
2976000	2977000	Yeah
2977000	2979000	How do you practice English?
2979000	2981000	Sorry, it's not related to your content
2981000	2983000	But I'm just curious
2983000	2984000	Yeah
2984000	2986000	Oh, yeah, it's an interesting question
2986000	2989000	Is that I think
2989000	2991000	I learned some English
2991000	2994000	Speaking practicing courses in UW
2994000	2997000	So, yeah, they gave me a lot of practice
2997000	3004000	To
3004000	3006000	Try to join
3006000	3008000	Reach some
3008000	3009000	Course master
3009000	3012000	The class near UW
3012000	3014000	So there's a lot of chance for me
3014000	3016000	Practicing English, yeah
3017000	3020000	Is that answer your question?
3020000	3022000	Oh, yes
3022000	3024000	And I heard some people said
3024000	3026000	That we should prepare
3026000	3028000	Maybe we should join the like
3028000	3030000	UHSL
3030000	3032000	It's faster than we prepare English fast
3032000	3033000	How do you think about that?
3033000	3035000	If I cannot reach the score
3035000	3037000	That my school wants
3037000	3039000	And did I need to apply for the language
3039000	3042000	UHSL first or
3042000	3043000	I just prepare English
3043000	3045000	And until I get a score
3045000	3046000	Get a TOEFL, pass the TOEFL
3046000	3050000	And then apply for the language school
3050000	3053000	Right
3053000	3055000	I think this is
3055000	3057000	Another interesting question
3057000	3060000	Actually, I will suggest that
3060000	3063000	It depends if you
3063000	3066000	I will suggest to prepare English
3066000	3069000	And try your best to pass the TOEFL
3069000	3072000	Or IELTS in Taiwan
3072000	3075000	Because if you
3075000	3076000	Go study abroad
3076000	3078000	And you go to some language schools
3078000	3080000	The cost is really
3080000	3081000	It's very high
3081000	3084000	And then it will spend a lot of money
3084000	3087000	But the most important thing
3087000	3089000	Is the but
3089000	3091000	If you
3091000	3093000	Sometimes
3093000	3095000	Some people are struggling
3095000	3099000	To pass the exams
3099000	3101000	So if you found that
3101000	3103000	You cannot concentrate to
3103000	3105000	Prepare for the exam
3105000	3110000	And you stuck on the TOEFL exam
3110000	3112000	And also the schools offer
3112000	3114000	Some opportunities that
3114000	3116000	They say you could go to the university
3116000	3118000	To take the language courses
3118000	3120000	And then you can get over
3120000	3122000	I would say you just go
3122000	3127000	Because the time is important
3127000	3130000	Do not to stuck one
3130000	3133000	One stage for a long time
3133000	3139000	I think that would be my answer
3139000	3141000	Thank you, Tom
3141000	3144000	Yeah, so I have a question
3144000	3148000	So if we go back to your title
3148000	3150000	I think you're saying that
3150000	3154000	This technique is mainly for
3154000	3156000	How do I say this
3156000	3159000	For deploying against fake news
3160000	3163000	But if you let the people decide
3163000	3166000	What will be the thing that they recognize
3166000	3168000	They basically just vote
3168000	3172000	Let's say Barack Obama just died
3172000	3175000	And if you let the internet vote
3175000	3177000	Probably 99% of the people will say
3177000	3179000	That's a fake news
3179000	3181000	But let's say objectively true thing
3181000	3184000	That cannot be voted to become a truth
3184000	3185000	In your system
3185000	3187000	How do you comment about that
3187000	3189000	Yeah, like I said
3189000	3192000	We trust the majority opinion
3192000	3194000	In our system
3194000	3198000	We have the reward and punishment mechanism
3198000	3202000	To make you to do the correct
3202000	3204000	And the honest things
3204000	3208000	Actually in all of the blockchain network
3208000	3211000	They have the specific incentive mechanism
3211000	3214000	To prevent from some malicious notes
3215000	3217000	So if you join our
3217000	3221000	We have two mechanism to prevent
3221000	3225000	This the notes to adjust to vote
3225000	3228000	Actually they will do their best
3228000	3231000	Because the first if they join our system
3231000	3234000	They need to pay for pay fees for
3234000	3235000	Like I said the stakes
3235000	3237000	So it's a cost
3237000	3238000	And then if we join system
3238000	3242000	And you did not do your job very well
3242000	3245000	You will get the punishment
3245000	3247000	And then eventually
3247000	3249000	You will be prohibited
3249000	3252000	To be the oppressors in our system
3252000	3255000	So our mechanism of incentive
3255000	3260000	Is core concept to incentive people
3260000	3262000	To check the content seriously
3262000	3268000	And to vote correctly
3268000	3271000	So if I understand correctly
3271000	3272000	Basically the assumption
3272000	3274000	That you are going with
3274000	3278000	Is that people generally have good intention
3278000	3279000	And they are answering
3279000	3281000	Based on their good intention
3281000	3283000	Regardless of the truth
3283000	3286000	So say Obama just died
3286000	3287000	Nobody knows
3287000	3291000	And they basically just like saying
3291000	3293000	It's not a good news
3293000	3295000	Because it's just not the thing
3295000	3298000	That is well established that I know
3298000	3300000	But it's true
3300000	3301000	So in your system
3301000	3304000	It's basically working against
3304000	3306000	Malicious information
3306000	3309000	But not exactly news
3309000	3312000	Can I say that
3312000	3316000	I could say how to define the bad news
3316000	3322000	Is that the content should be correct
3322000	3328000	So when you say Obama is dead
3328000	3330000	If it's not a truth
3330000	3334000	Our system will consider it is a bad news
3334000	3337000	But in my scenario
3337000	3342000	I'm saying what if he really just died
3342000	3345000	But nobody knows like 10 minutes ago
3345000	3348000	And I go out and say
3348000	3350000	Hey guys, he just died
3350000	3353000	That will be a fake news in your system
3353000	3354000	Because nobody knows
3354000	3356000	That's true
3357000	3358000	Yeah, you're right
3358000	3362000	But if you say Obama is dead
3362000	3364000	But nobody knows
3364000	3368000	I would say that
3368000	3372000	This situation is really
3372000	3374000	It's extremely
3374000	3377000	That's quite a situation news
3377000	3379000	Yeah, so I think
3379000	3382000	Because those oppressing actors
3382000	3385000	Are very capable to check the contents
3385000	3392000	So if they hesitate to give some opinions
3392000	3394000	Their confidence will lower
3394000	3399000	So the trust score of the agree
3399000	3401000	Authentic and the fact
3401000	3403000	They will be very similar
3403000	3406000	So our system will not treat it
3406000	3411000	In your case as a very tend to be real
3411000	3413000	Or fake, it will be a bad news
3414000	3420000	But we could give you an objective opinion
3420000	3422000	To check this content
3424000	3426000	I see
3426000	3428000	Okay
3428000	3431000	I do have some comment about the previous question
3431000	3433000	Just like
3433000	3434000	Okay
3434000	3436000	Okay, first, thank you for a nice talk
3436000	3438000	And for the tokenomics design
3438000	3441000	I think that's about how you make a dispute system
3441000	3443000	Because for now it's like a one-time votes
3443000	3445000	And you just get the result done
3445000	3447000	But if you see like
3447000	3450000	In order for the prediction market
3450000	3451000	Just like if you predict
3451000	3455000	And like whether Obama will die between like 2021
3455000	3458000	And people at 2021 votes
3458000	3462000	Maybe 3% of the voters enough to get yes or no
3462000	3465000	But if you don't trust the result
3465000	3469000	You can put your stake against that voting result
3469000	3471000	And then more people need to vote
3471000	3476000	If you stake like maybe 1% of the total token
3476000	3479000	Then all of the people need to vote
3479000	3483000	So I guess you need to kind of like refine
3483000	3486000	The appeal system or the tokenomics
3486000	3492000	Because I think the previous question is quite valid
3492000	3497000	Because you assume that like the majority vote
3497000	3498000	Will know the truth
3498000	3500000	But maybe it takes some time right
3500000	3504000	So but if you like you want to label the news in 10 minutes
3504000	3509000	And definitely well it's hard to get information
3509000	3513000	To propagate to like the society or the civilization
3513000	3515000	To get people votes and get the correct result
3515000	3520000	So I guess you just need to have a dispute system
3520000	3521000	I guess
3521000	3522000	Yeah, sure
3522000	3524000	But like you said
3524000	3525000	Yeah
3526000	3531000	If you want to get news in just 10 minutes
3531000	3534000	To see if it's correct or not
3534000	3537000	It will be difficult to achieve that
3537000	3539000	Because maybe like Elon said
3539000	3543000	The news is not just known by minority people
3543000	3548000	But yeah, for this case
3548000	3552000	I think for previous the current solutions
3552000	3556000	I think people will have
3556000	3558000	Like we have put more stakes
3558000	3563000	Or we can to introduce more
3563000	3565000	The sub-parties, the libraries
3565000	3567000	And we can ask their opinions
3567000	3571000	So our speed will get in faster
3574000	3579000	Yeah, well I do think this is a very interesting
3579000	3581000	Actually very valuable research
3581000	3583000	I'm just being curious
3583000	3588000	Yeah, so anyone has other questions
3591000	3592000	I have some questions
3592000	3599000	Do you really plan to launch this thing in a public chain
3599000	3602000	Because I was saying the past like two years
3602000	3605000	Hyperledger is not like really striving
3605000	3608000	And even though like the gas fee
3608000	3610000	And the transaction fee is an issue
3610000	3612000	For like Bitcoin in Syria
3612000	3614000	But for the new generation
3614000	3615000	Like high throughput blockchain
3615000	3617000	Also support smart contract
3617000	3620000	Then it will be a much better platform
3620000	3621000	I would say
3621000	3624000	Because well Hyperledger is definitely more
3624000	3626000	Like clean and more permission
3626000	3631000	But how to really scale the platform
3631000	3634000	I would say like public chain is still better
3634000	3636000	Than the permission chain
3637000	3640000	Yeah, actually you are right
3640000	3644000	We plan to introduce some
3644000	3646000	Digital tokens in our system
3646000	3649000	Because we need to get the reward or punishment
3649000	3653000	So Ethereum will be the one choice
3653000	3656000	That we consider to transfer
3656000	3658000	The Hyperledger to the Ethereum
3658000	3662000	And also there are other tokens
3662000	3663000	That invented right now
3663000	3665000	They have a great
3665000	3667000	Because the Ethereum and Bitcoin
3667000	3670000	Their speed is too slow
3670000	3675000	But there are lots of faster blockchain network
3675000	3677000	So we consider to
3677000	3680000	Yeah, like you said to transfer
3680000	3687000	From the private blockchain to the public
3687000	3690000	Okay, thank you for applying
3690000	3691000	Yeah, thank you
3692000	3697000	Okay, so one last time
3697000	3699000	Anybody has question
3699000	3702000	Okay, if not, please again
3702000	3704000	Really turn on your microphone
3704000	3707000	So let's thank our speaker again
3707000	3709000	That's a very interesting talk
3709000	3711000	Thank you, thank you everyone
3711000	3712000	If you have any question
3712000	3715000	If you also have any question, please
