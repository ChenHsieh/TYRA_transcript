1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,640
好,OK,現在大家應該看得到我的螢幕

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,760
那,sorry我看一下能不能播放

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
應該是可以

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:34,560
好吧,我一時一時,那可能先用這個模式

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,960
大家好,那我們今天是那個來自於Project Terra

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:49,920
今天就是請到兩位教授,一位是來自於休士頓大學的

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:00,640
化學系的陳泰仁教授,然後另外一位是來自George Mason University的

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,440
楊樹明教授,是犯罪學系的教授

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:17,440
那今天這場是7月17號是我們Project Terra在暑假舉辦一連串就是夏季特別活動的其中之一

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:27,440
那我們在今年的夏季特別活動呢,我們還有舉辦,預期要舉辦其他幾場不同主題的演講

11
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:35,440
那有關於PhD申請的mentor mentee媒合計畫呢,除了今天這場演講之外

12
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,440
在8月28號還有另外一場就是比較專注於留學申請文件撰寫的一個工作坊

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:51,440
那要提醒大家的是,如果你有興趣參與我們的mentor mentee媒合計畫的話

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,440
7月17號也就是今天跟8月28號的兩場演講都必須要出席

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:05,440
那我們這邊可能會做記錄,那這會作為我們之後mentor mentee媒合計畫報名的一個依據

16
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,440
所以再請大家記得出席8月28號的演講

17
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:21,440
那8月28號的演講呢,我們會再寄送連結給大家

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,440
那除了這兩場演講以外,Project Terra還有舉辦科學繪圖

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,440
包括使用illustrator或是latex去做科學繪圖的部分

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
然後還有新冠肺炎的主題跟科學寫作跟大眾傳播

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,440
那歡迎有興趣的人就是參加這樣子

22
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
那如果你對Project Terra的工作有興趣

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
你有興趣想要成為我們的工作人員

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,440
然後一起推動台灣年輕學者的一些每週演講

25
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,440
或者是其他各種學術活動也歡迎你在今年加入我們

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,440
那我們今年在下一週7月24號會舉辦年度會員大會跟工作人員招募說明會

27
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,440
如果你有興趣的話歡迎你來參加

28
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:25,440
那今天我現在就把主持棒交給另外兩個教授

29
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,440
請他們分享申請博士班綜合來說應該具備哪些心態

30
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
然後哪些條件

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:42,440
非常感謝今天兩位教授願意來到這邊提供他們的一些經驗

32
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,440
那這邊就交給他們,謝謝

33
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:06,440
所以我們現在是先請楊教授先開始嗎?

34
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
對對對

35
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,440
因為現在那個video有點lagging

36
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:21,440
那今天的那個報告主題會由我跟陳教授來討論

37
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,440
在你們要申請學校之前有什麼事情可以先想想或先了解

38
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:36,440
然後什麼樣的資訊可以幫助各位在選擇學校在申請學校甚至在考慮要不要念博士班之前

39
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
就是先想過這一招

40
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,440
那希望能夠在這個這些的那個資訊內容能夠幫助大家申請過程更順利

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
那由我來講第一個部分

42
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,440
然後之後第二個部分申請的程序

43
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
那我們就等下再交給陳教授

44
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,440
那這所有的聽眾都是有興趣申請博士班的

45
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,440
那如果要申請碩士班或申請其他的

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
比如說MBA或其他的專業的可能就比較不是不適合在

47
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,440
就是我們今天的主題可能就比較不適合在

48
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
那所以就是

49
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
跟大家報告一下

50
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
那第一點當然就是想到就是說

51
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,440
那很多人當然就是申請博士班帶有這個有一些期待

52
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,440
就是為什麼來念這個博士班呢

53
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
那當然就是說

54
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,440
那個來不一定是美國或者是在世界各國

55
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
然後能夠念一個學位就是

56
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
就是不是只有有名氣

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
而是說你可以就是學到最先進的技術學科

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
可以就是學到最先進的技術

59
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
學到一些最新的知識

60
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
然後甚至可以在這邊大展你的長才

61
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,440
那當然就是台灣一直常被詬病的就是說

62
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
那個薪資上來說

63
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
有一些那個就是薪資的天花板

64
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,440
例如說好像就是同樣的職位就同樣的薪水

65
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
但在國外通常很多個國家

66
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
但不是每個國家至少在美國的話

67
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
就是並沒有說salary cap這樣東西

68
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,440
那當然就是說我們以學術界來講的話

69
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,440
在以色列在加拿大可能也是比較像台灣這樣的制度

70
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
但至少在歐美很多國家來說

71
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
並沒有那種就是固定的薪水

72
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
那這當然是一個前提一個很重要的想法

73
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
那第二個就是說

74
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
來念博士班那我們也是希望就是說

75
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
我們在所學能夠創造新的知識

76
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,440
能夠跟大家分享

77
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,440
然後就是而且能夠做最原創的研究

78
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
能夠做最那個

79
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
在你有興趣的領域發展

80
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
就像最近大家常知道

81
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
例如說新冠病毒的疫苗啊

82
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
你專門的一個學科

83
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
說不定在某些時候能夠在世界上

84
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
發現很大的作用

85
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
這當然也是一個很重要的

86
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
然後也是希望說來這邊找到更好的訓練方式

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
能夠更精進你的教學

88
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
更精進你的研究方式

89
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
那甚至說你也能夠學會一些不同的技能

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
不是只是在學術工作上

91
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
而是在很多個不同的工作上

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
都能夠運用自如

93
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
那另外一個部分希望來這邊能夠學習

94
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
leadership這樣的一個概念

95
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
就是除了教學除了研究

96
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
然後能夠發展出你自己的一個

97
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
就是說生涯

98
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
怎麼樣是你希望能夠走的一個生涯

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
那另外還有一個

100
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
大家來國外念書一個很大的想法

101
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
就是說能夠有比較

102
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
擴展的視野跨文化的一些想法

103
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
跨文化的研究

104
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
你可以結交不同國家的朋友

105
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
可以了解

106
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
很多不同的文化

107
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
甚至可以有更多的一些

108
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
不好意思教授

109
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
你的螢幕好像沒有跟著動

110
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
可以嗎?

111
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
可以重新分享一下

112
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
TowerPoint的畫面嗎?

113
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
等一下

114
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
因為我發現我好像不是被

115
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
設定為講師

116
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
你可以幫我設定為講師嗎?

117
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
因為我不知道是不是有影響

118
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
因為剛剛好像沒有問題

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
就是

120
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
因為後來好像

121
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
可以幫我設定為講師

122
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
我不知道是不是因為這樣

123
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
你現在還是主持人

124
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
但是

125
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
可以幫我設定為講師嗎?

126
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
好像我這邊看不太到

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
還是藍組長你只要怎麼

128
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
設定嗎?

129
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
因為我這邊看不到

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
這邊沒辦法動

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
這樣嗎?

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
我這邊沒辦法改動

133
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
不曉得為什麼

134
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
我這邊是看得到螢幕的

135
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
如果有人看不到螢幕麻煩

136
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
在聊天室讓我們知道

137
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
我們現在看到

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
所有關於在國外的PhD的事情

139
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
這個嗎?

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
對對對

141
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
這告訴我如果你

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
還是有狀況的話

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
再跟我講

144
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
無論如何在沒有看到的時候

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
希望我剛剛講的有清楚

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
重點就是正常是一些

147
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
懶念PhD的誘因

148
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
但是

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
跟著動嗎?

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
現在有跟著動

151
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
OK

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
這當然另外一個想

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
未來的走向

154
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
未來的走向

155
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
那我們先跳

156
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
那我這邊當然是以社會科學

157
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
來講一下就是說

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
社會科學裡面當然是你可以走的路很多

159
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
社會科學就是

160
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
除了學術

161
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
以外學術的

162
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
比如說研究大學研究型

163
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
R1 R2大學教學型大學

164
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
那個所謂的博雅學院

165
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
或社區大學

166
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
那當然會做的是Tenure

167
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Tenure Job的那個工作

168
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
或說在甚至在大學裡面有些是研究

169
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
工作並不是

170
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
所謂的教職,但是是純研究的工作

171
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
有一些Term Faculty

172
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Term Faculty

173
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
就是不是在不是

174
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Tenure Job在台灣來說

175
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
好所謂的專案助理教授這樣的概念

176
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
或者是說有Visiting Professor

177
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
就是訪問學人

178
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
那也是比較

179
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
臨時的Temporary

180
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Temporary Position就是比較像是台灣的兼任

181
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
就是教一門課或兩門課

182
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
那大概都是兼職的這樣子

183
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
就是學術界的工作有分,當然還有

184
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
更細的還有,但是我是大致上這樣子的

185
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
那也有另外的人想說我不想要做學術工作

186
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
像我的學生有些是說

187
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
我對於純學術工作沒有興趣

188
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
但是我希望能夠改變世界

189
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
或是我希望能夠跟社會接軌

190
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
他們可能去智庫工作

191
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
或甚至去研究機構工作

192
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
有些人會去NGO工作

193
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
那我有些學生或朋友會在

194
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
FBI工作,不管是那個當地政府

195
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
或是聯邦的相關的

196
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
像我朋友在NIJ

197
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
司法部工作或是說

198
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
FBI工作,或者是說

199
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
當地的警察機關工作

200
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
當然這個部分也許這個就比較看身份

201
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
尤其目前美國

202
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
尤其在美國的話就是

203
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
對於在政府工作很多都要求說

204
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
你是起碼綠卡或者是公民的

205
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
所以這個東西的

206
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
這個是一個出路,但是就不是

207
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
也許不是對每個人都適合的出路

208
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
所以會有一些非研究型機構

209
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
或是一些組織,譬如說有些人會想要去

210
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
例如說犯罪人保護的

211
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
相關的組織

212
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
或甚至說

213
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
反人口犯罪的組織

214
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
像我也有蠻多學生在

215
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
不同的一些機關工作的

216
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
那

217
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
但是就是有一點要講的

218
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
就是講到這麼多好的狀況

219
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
但是也要考慮就是說

220
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
有時候工作

221
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
畢業後找工作,拿到一個博士學位

222
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
是不是一定對你找工作有幫助呢

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
這個事情

224
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
就是也是不見得不一定的

225
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
為什麼這樣說,就是說

226
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
你可能要看你未來的工作

227
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
所需要的學位的標準

228
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
有時候

229
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
大家工作學,尤其你如果不在

230
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
學界工作的話,你去業界工作的話

231
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
他們也很擔心一個事,就是

232
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
over qualification,就是你有一個博士學位

233
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
但他們只需要一個碩士人才

234
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
或是只需要大學畢業

235
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
那至少在歐美的話,有時候他們

236
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
很希望說你有高學歷

237
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
來找比較低的工作

238
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
因為一方面是薪水的部分的考量

239
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
一方面就是說也是覺得浪費人才

240
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
所以就是也許

241
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
你可以先考慮一下就是你未來的

242
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
職業的展望大概是什麼樣的職業展望

243
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
然後也然後再考慮說

244
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
欸,尋這個就是

245
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
走PHD的路是不是對你來說

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
最適合的一個路

247
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
那請問現在PowerPoint

248
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
有在移動嗎

249
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
我這邊有

250
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
OK

251
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
那講到一個

252
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
這個就是之前我跟陳教授

253
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
我們前面在聊的時候,我們對這個

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
都有心有戚戚焉,就想要

255
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
跟大家分享一件事就是說

256
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
有些時候來念博士班

257
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
之前需要想一下

258
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
就是為什麼你要來念這個博士班

259
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
為什麼這個問題很重要呢

260
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
因為就是博士班這個東西

261
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
並不是說像碩士班念個一兩年兩三年

262
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
就OK,但是

263
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
念到博士的話就像我們剛剛說的

264
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
你找工作人家也會擔心你會不會

265
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
那個就是高學歷然後低就

266
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
然後就是你念了博士

267
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
以後對你來說有些部分

268
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
眼界變得更開闊

269
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
但是工作部分或者一些部分

270
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
不見得變得更反而會有時候會

271
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
窄化了,所以這時候你可能要想一想

272
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
而且你投資下去的時間

273
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
金錢跟其他都比較多,你可能想想

274
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
為什麼你要念這個博士班

275
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
是因為家人的期待

276
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
你的重要他人的期待

277
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
或者是說你的

278
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
身邊的人一直告訴你說啊你這麼聰明

279
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
不念書太可惜了

280
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
是為了別人的期待來念這個書的呢

281
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
甚至是鄰居的那個阿伯阿母

282
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
就是說啊那個

283
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
誰誰誰這麼聰明怎麼不念一個博士

284
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
是因為這樣嗎

285
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
還是因為想要對那個追求自我實現

286
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
就是你可能就是我就是很喜歡做研究

287
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
我覺得這是我的使命

288
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
或者是說你對於某種議題

289
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
非常有熱情就像我可能

290
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
學生從很年輕就跟我說

291
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
我想要研究就是

292
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
人口販運我覺得這個東西很重要

293
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
那就是他的passion

294
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
然後就是很清楚知道

295
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
想要走哪一個路

296
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
那這個也許是一個你的內在

297
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
東西就可能就很重要

298
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
還是說能念這個就是覺得說

299
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
念完博士好像可以做什麼工作

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
好像是一種社會地位好像會覺得

301
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
說啊那個以後就收入就很穩定

302
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
就很高那個其實不是這樣就像

303
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
我們說的美國雖然至少在

304
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
美國他沒有那個salary

305
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
的cap沒有說最高的那個cap

306
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
在哪裡但是同時

307
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
也代表就是說就是那個

308
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
分佈上並不是很均勻的

309
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
並不是說同樣的工作

310
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
你的payout就會一樣的

311
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
所以這個事情你可能要想清楚

312
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
如果你來念書是為了覺得說

313
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
啊我幾年後保證一定有工作

314
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
保證有多好的薪水

315
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
這個是沒有辦法這樣子的所以就是

316
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
如果是為了這麼直接

317
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
或是這麼實際的理由

318
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
你可能要考慮一下這個是不是一個

319
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
好的最適合的

320
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
走到那個方式走到你想要的

321
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
目標的一個路

322
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
因為尤其現在大家都知道

323
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
covid以後更嚴重就是在

324
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
臺灣的話你拿到的博士學位

325
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
那同一個工作很多人在搶的

326
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
然後在美國這個是

327
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
更嚴重像去年我們系上要聘

328
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
兩個人然後我們要聘

329
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
兩個人我好像收到大概

330
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
160封的申請

331
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
函就是為了兩個工作

332
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
所以這個其實現在是非常競爭的

333
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
你拿到一個博士學位其實並沒有保證

334
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
你一定會拿到一個工作所以這個東西

335
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
就是你要想想對自己你的動機

336
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
是什麼你為什麼要

337
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
念這個東西那有些人就說啊我也

338
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
不知道什麼要念尤其臺灣

339
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
那個臺灣很有這種什麼萬般

340
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
皆下品我有讀書到就是覺得說

341
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
我不知道做什麼就繼續念好了

342
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
這也是一種想法啦但是就是

343
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
可能在某個時候也要開始想想

344
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
就說你自己對未來的熱情在哪裡

345
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
那就像這邊說的

346
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
就說其實沒有什麼叫對的或錯的

347
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
原因啦沒有什麼是對的或不對的

348
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
原因但是可能要先問清楚

349
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
問自己進入你的目標

350
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
什麼你想要達成的是什麼樣的一個

351
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
呃自我成就

352
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
那還有一個很重要就是說

353
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
你可不可以接受

354
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
你能不能接受就是如果

355
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
這個走過去

356
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
走回去路的結果不是你所想

357
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
像的你能不能承受這樣子

358
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
一個呃結果

359
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
那這些都是我覺得這些都可以先想

360
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
不是說要打擊各位不是說

361
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
讓大家覺得啊那個人生很悲觀

362
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
不是但是我覺得能夠先好好

363
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
考慮過這樣子的事情的話比較

364
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
能夠面對就是呃到

365
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
時候就說哎人生有什麼挫折知道

366
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
這個只是一個過程而已

367
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
哎這是一個process就是你可能路上

368
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
總會踢到一點石頭那不代表

369
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
說是呃不代表說一定

370
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
就是會怎麼樣那但是就是

371
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
但是可能先想清楚

372
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,440
就知道說哎就比較你

373
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
如果比較堅定就覺得說這個我是可以克服

374
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
的但是如果沒有很堅定的意念

375
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
的話有人容易遇到挫折就覺得

376
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
我想要退縮

377
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
那當然就是另外一部分就是

378
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
考慮的比較實際一點就是

379
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
什麼是你需要付出的代價讓

380
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
時間努力你的金錢

381
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
能不能面對未來的呃不確定

382
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
性呃念博士班畢竟

383
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
也是很多壓力就是能不能做出一些

384
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
好的東西嗎能不能在一些

385
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
期限內念完然後通常

386
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
這個講一年就說念博士班

387
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
人常常會有一些低自尊

388
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
低自尊的一些概念就覺得

389
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
啊怎麼為什麼我的旁邊的沒有

390
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
誰快我的發表沒有誰好

391
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
那我的什麼呃成績沒有誰

392
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
好就是很容易變成陷入

393
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
這樣一個迷思的比較

394
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
然後而且常常是會有挫折的你投個

395
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
稿常常那個你投個稿

396
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
馬上被接受然後大家去慶

397
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
祝這個死者太少了現在

398
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
投稿通常一定是要所以你如果拿

399
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
到r&r可以修改的話就已經

400
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
應該就放邊跑了你拿到

401
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
投個稿馬上就可以看出來這個基本上

402
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
是天方夜譚的所以其實中間

403
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
過了很多有很多的挫折是要

404
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
面對的那就像我們一

405
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
開始說的有沒有好處呢當然有好

406
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
處啊就你可以學到一些知識

407
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
你有很大的不同的生活經驗

408
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
跟研究經驗那你有一些

409
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
得到一些不同技能那你的

410
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
眼界會比較開闊你會有

411
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
跨文化的一些想法甚

412
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
至說你可以遇到一些很酷的人

413
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
很了不起的大師你以前是

414
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
在課本上看過的可能就在你的辦

415
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
公室隔壁你可以跟他聊一些研究問題

416
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
受到啟發那這些我覺得

417
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
其實都是是看不到的一些

418
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
收穫但是這個就是我們

419
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
也不能只講好的一面那不講

420
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
那個不講一些負面的部分

421
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
啦那在我

422
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
跳到下一個部分的時候我想

423
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
問一下陳老師這邊你有沒有想要

424
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
在這邊先再補充一下就是

425
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
對於學生的那個就是

426
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
來就是來

427
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
那個pc這個的一些想要補充

428
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
的部分

429
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
嗯沒有學長老師講的很好

430
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
就請繼續

431
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
好那我就先繼續講完

432
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
等一下再留給你講

433
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
那就是在如果

434
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
各位就是想玩這個東西還是覺得

435
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
很堅定就說可以是我想

436
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
要念研究所那當然第一個

437
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
部分就是你要找

438
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
學校哪些學校是

439
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
適合的或者我說

440
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
哪些學校其實在研究所的話

441
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
比較在博士班比較

442
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
specific是不是

443
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
學校這個部分而是program

444
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
哪個就是

445
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
哪個系哪個所是適合

446
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
你的那當然第一個所以

447
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
我會我們會把那個program放在最前面

448
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
就是我認為

449
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
program應該比學校的就是

450
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
的rank

451
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
就是比較是優先的

452
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
就是因為畢竟畢竟再好的學校

453
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
也可能有些有些就是

454
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
例如說某些學校像哈佛

455
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
可能某些系很好哪些系其實

456
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
沒有那麼好所以並不是學校越好

457
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
系就一定越好那我

458
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
自己尤其在念到博士班這麼專業的時候

459
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
我會把program的那個

460
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
就是能夠提供的甚至

461
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
排名program內容放在最高的地方

462
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
那你要看看就是這個系所

463
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
是不是適合你的研究領域

464
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
那是不是能夠提供需要的資源

465
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
那例如說

466
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
系上有沒有老師或是說lab

467
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
在就是專門在研究

468
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
你想要研究的部分因為都要念到博士

469
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
的就是學生其實基本上

470
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
應該有一些就是說你想要了解的

471
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
領域但這不代表說你以後不能改變

472
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
這不代表說你不會

473
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
跨領域或轉領域因為像我就轉過領域

474
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
但是這個部分需要

475
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
先了解就是如果你有

476
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
很確定的興趣

477
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
那就是找到program

478
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
有你想要跟領域一起合作的教授

479
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
就很重要

480
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
那要怎麼選好的學校呢

481
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
那當然就是說就

482
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
卡內基就是排名commission

483
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
of higher education它有分R1

484
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
R2跟D它有分很多種

485
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
那我現在只列就是能夠

486
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
與博士學位的那當然就

487
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
第一個就是doctorate university就是

488
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
R1就是非常高的就是

489
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
尊重

490
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
著重

491
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
研究的部分那通常那邊的教學

492
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
老師的教學負擔就比較低通常

493
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
是一二或二二就是一學期一門

494
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
一學期兩門這樣的狀況

495
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
那R2的話就是也是有

496
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
也是著重研究但是

497
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
同時也著重教學那老師在這邊的

498
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
教學負擔通常會比較大一點

499
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
那但是還是期待老師能夠

500
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
做出很好的研究但是這個部分

501
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
就變成說因為老師的教學負擔

502
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
稍微大一點所以通常來說能夠

503
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
分到研究時間就不一定這麼多

504
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
那D跟PU就是

505
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
這個有些professional school

506
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
就是可能有些例如有些

507
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
來念譬如說

508
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
物理治療專業學校或說

509
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
不是念PhD

510
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
而是念PsychD就是心理

511
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
博士那就是不一樣那這是

512
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
比較專業的一些學位

513
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
那但是要注意如果你要是念

514
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
那個這樣子的professional

515
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
university professional degree的話

516
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
很多時候找教職他們會要求

517
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
你拿的是PhD而不是

518
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
professional doctor

519
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
那個到時候就會有一些差距因為

520
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
要求也不一樣他的評鑑方式也不太一樣

521
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
那講到你就選擇program以後

522
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
那如果program差不多的話

523
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
那還是要回答看學校

524
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
因為學校的ranking越好他的資源

525
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
越好的話他的

526
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
通常也會有吸引更多不同的

527
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
好的學生或說不同的

528
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
一些資歷這種一些

529
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
overall reputation還是對你的

530
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
未來有幫助的所以當program

531
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
差不多的時候也要考慮school的ranking

532
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
然後還有一些

533
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
什麼就是你在考慮的時候就是

534
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
地點像對我來說當初

535
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
有一個很北的學校在紐約

536
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
一個很南的學校在佛羅里達

537
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
一個我嫌太冷一個嫌太熱所以後來

538
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
去馬里蘭讀書那這對你來說

539
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
geographic location重不重要

540
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
那另外一個就是如果說考慮說

541
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
之後回台灣探親方便

542
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
那這時候大學校也可能是一個優勢

543
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
就是而且不是

544
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
只有說回台灣有

545
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
直飛的飛機另外就是說

546
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
你的工作會不會需要

547
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
就是容易travel

548
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
那這樣travel的方便性

549
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
對你來說也是一個

550
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
考量那cost of living

551
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
就是你的生活支出

552
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
那就是你要考慮就是說

553
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
如果通常來說會有獎助學金

554
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
但是在大城市來說

555
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
一般研究生的獎助學金大概沒有辦法

556
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
負擔你的生活

557
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
可能要自己補貼一些

558
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
但是如果在一些比較

559
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
生活費比較低廉的州的話

560
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
很多學生我聽說就是拿了獎助

561
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
學金還可以存一些錢下來

562
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
所以cost of living是需要考量的

563
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
那opportunity像我自己是犯罪學

564
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
領域的那例如說我的學生

565
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
在DC的話就是常常

566
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
可能我們有一些機會我們會去做

567
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
國會報告就跟國會的那個議員

568
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
報告就是我們在犯罪

569
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
預防政策或是一些

570
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
研究的結果那我們比較有這樣的機會

571
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
跟他們相處或是說甚至

572
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
要做intern也會有

573
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
比較多的聯邦的機構可以去

574
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
做實習的工作

575
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
或是什麼的或是

576
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
之後在畢業像我有一個學生碩士

577
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
畢業還沒有畢業前就拿到

578
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
urban institute跟think tank的offer

579
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
因為就很近所以就是這個opportunity

580
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
也是未來你可能要考量

581
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
如果你有想在這邊例如說

582
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
不管是長期求職或是

583
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
一些的工作經驗

584
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
opportunity也是重要的那還有

585
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
就是氣候啦就是如果氣候對

586
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
你來說你的

587
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
舒適圈也是沒有那麼大的

588
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
或者你想要體驗很不同的生活

589
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
不同的也許你就會特別選某些

590
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
地區有不同的氣候

591
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
那

592
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
另外一個跟大家講的就是

593
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
通常來說都念到

594
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
博士班了嘛要找學校的話

595
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
可能就是自己要多做一點功課

596
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
因為如果只看就是說台灣的

597
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
這是哪些畢業的或是說台灣人知道

598
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
學校有些時候你可能會

599
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
有遺珠之憾就是很多很好學校

600
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
台灣人不見得知道像

601
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
我們都知道

602
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
也許這個學校很多人知道

603
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
但是就是相對所謂的

604
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
大家比較熟知的

605
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
某些學校來說他們也許沒

606
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
那麼出名但是他們在專業領域或

607
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
甚至在美國其實也是是

608
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
非常的也是很

609
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
well known的那所以就是

610
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
要多做一些功課

611
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
就了解你們自己的領域

612
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
而不是被台灣人所

613
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
常知道的學校排名影響

614
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
因為這有可能會喪失掉

615
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
很好的一些機會

616
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
然後另外一個就是

617
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
你要怎麼樣對學校不熟的話你要

618
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
怎麼知道就是說這邊的老師

619
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
好不好那一定要做功課怎麼做功課

620
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
就是看看那個每個老師

621
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
系上老師的研究經歷

622
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
他們的發表經歷他們有沒有

623
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
研究計畫然後或是他們的

624
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
研究領域那這些都是很

625
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
重要的那所以就是希望

626
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
大家就是在呃這些

627
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
部分都要好好的考慮就是說

628
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
呃哪些你是比較需要來

629
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
做考量的

630
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
ok 那這個部分

631
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
我先把呃這個呃

632
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
明天的部分交給陳教授

633
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
那陳教授我可以幫你for the slide

634
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
就是我們請陳教授來講就是說當

635
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
你這些東西都考慮過了你要

636
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
準備來申請學校的時候你要

637
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
怎麼樣做這些準備工作還有哪些

638
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
需要不過陳教授也可以補充

639
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
講的哪些可能還沒有提到的部分

640
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
ok

641
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
好大家可以聽得到我說話嗎

642
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
alright

643
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
呃所以現在在slide上面說的是

644
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
基本上你在準備

645
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
申請的過程中會

646
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
經歷過的幾個特定的過程

647
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
那大家在一開始準備

648
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
的時候當然就是呃

649
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
先準備一些英文

650
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
測驗然後

651
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
當你準備完的英文測驗之後

652
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
發現ok自己的英文測驗

653
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
還不錯那接下來事情就是

654
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
準備來尋找說你想要

655
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
申請的program或

656
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
想要申請的學校

657
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
那基本上我建議先

658
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
嗯

659
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
不用一次申請不用一次找

660
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
太多就是先用可能五家

661
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
school作為一個target

662
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
那先找一下呃

663
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
對應的訊息那等一下我們會給

664
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
你一個example可以讓你看一下大概

665
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
怎麼win through這些過程

666
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
那

667
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
嗯在申請的過程中你也

668
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
必須準備很多

669
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
你的

670
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
track record document比如說你的

671
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
成績單比如說你的

672
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
呃cv的

673
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
準備ok那這個時候呢

674
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
建議大家就是越早

675
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
準備越好

676
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
接下來就會有一個很重要兩個

677
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
document我個人

678
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
的感覺是

679
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
在當過

680
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
graduate search committee multiple time

681
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
我覺得在國外

682
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
審查

683
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
在美國審查國外

684
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
學生的時候你的statement

685
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
of purpose跟

686
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
recognition letter

687
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
是兩個最重要而且是最

688
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
決定最具有決定性的

689
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
文件來決定你會不會被錄取

690
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
ok那當你把

691
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
這些文件都準備完之後呢你就可以

692
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
上網然後走online application

693
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
那基本上這個

694
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
過程是不管你是在

695
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
哪一個field

696
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
基本上都不會改變太多

697
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
那時間的話當然是越早

698
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
準備越好那

699
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
嗯

700
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
如果你今天能夠來參加

701
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
project tira的webinar的話

702
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
我相信在某種程度上

703
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
you are more

704
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
you prepare early enough

705
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
你知道在哪裡找一些有用的訊息

706
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
那下一張slide

707
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
please

708
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
ok

709
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
那接下來呢

710
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
我們就要開始

711
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
一步步講說

712
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
這每一個document你應該要

713
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
怎麼準備有什麼東西是必須要小心的

714
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
ok下一張

715
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
ok那

716
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
因為我本身是一個化學系的老師

717
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
然後我是在

718
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
university of houston

719
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
所以我們就用我們系上的

720
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
申請網站來

721
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
做一個example讓大家

722
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
知道說ok當你要

723
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
做這些事情的時候

724
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
基本上去哪裡找資料

725
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
那當你identify

726
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
一個你想要申請的學校的時候

727
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
就先到那個學校的

728
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
系站上面

729
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
那基本上

730
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
系站上面的話你就會看到一個

731
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
PHD的program

732
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
然後你就可以點進去

733
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
ok那現在我們系上的話就很明顯

734
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
就在左下方有一個apply now

735
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
那你如果點進去的話

736
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
他就會跟你講說各式各樣

737
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
申請的資料

738
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
跟你必須要具備的

739
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
基本的requirement

740
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
ok下一張

741
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
please

742
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
ok

743
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
那進去之後呢

744
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
通常有一些document是

745
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
你基本上沒辦法做太多

746
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
modification的ok

747
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
就是你之前怎麼樣

748
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
就是攤牌的時候

749
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
ok那

750
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
最基本的document包含了

751
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
你的大學

752
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
或是碩士的

753
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
學位證書ok

754
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
那接下來就是你的成績單

755
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
那接下來就是你的cv

756
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
ok這三個document

757
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
基本上你沒辦法著墨太多

758
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
尤其是你的證書

759
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
跟成績單那基本上就已經

760
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
你只要你所需要

761
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
做的事情就是去

762
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
你的教務處

763
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
把這些東西申請出來

764
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
ok那申請完之後呢

765
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
你就要花

766
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
一些時間ok

767
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
跟學校裡面我相信都有一些

768
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
幫助大學生

769
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
寫自己cv的一些機構

770
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
那這個時候

771
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
不是害羞的時候我會建議大家

772
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
就是踴躍地去尋找

773
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
而且利用這些資源

774
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
來把你的cv寫得

775
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
生動有趣

776
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
ok

777
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
基本上這個東西就是

778
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
沒辦法做太多的著墨啦

779
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
那你的cv的格式上面

780
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
如果能夠做到清楚簡單

781
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
那當然是最好

782
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
不過基本上就是

783
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
沒有太多事情可以做ok

784
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
那接下來呢就是你的英文測驗

785
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
那英文測驗

786
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
基本上大家看的東西

787
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
如果是在美國的話

788
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
基本上主要就是看兩個嘛

789
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,440
一個是GRE

790
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
那

791
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
越來越多的學校

792
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
尤其是

793
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
research institute

794
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
的學校我覺得

795
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
大家越來越不看GRE了

796
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
很多學校包含

797
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
或是很多medical center

798
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
或是

799
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
基本上就是在接下來這一年

800
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
他們就都沒有要求

801
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
GRE

802
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
的成績了

803
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
ok所以說我覺得

804
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
在現在這個階段我猜會

805
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
越來越多學校提供

806
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
這樣子的

807
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
辯論力

808
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
最主要是因為大家都想要

809
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
招到好的國際學生

810
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
ok那很多國際學生

811
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
他們在各方面看起來都很傑出

812
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
可是在GRE上面他們就是過不了那個門檻

813
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
那會造成

814
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
很多遺珠之憾那在國外的

815
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
學校我覺得他們也知道

816
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
GRE的成績

817
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
跟後來學生在課業上面的表現

818
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
基本上沒有什麼關聯

819
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
所以

820
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
越來越多學生在push就是廢止

821
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
GRE這個requirement

822
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
ok所以如果你不是很清楚

823
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
說你想要申請的學校是不是必備

824
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
是不是GRE是必要的

825
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
那我會建議說趕快上他們的網站

826
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
看一下他們最新

827
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
的

828
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
徵才實質

829
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
這樣就會知道說你是不是要準備GRE

830
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
ok

831
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
另一方面我覺得托福是一個

832
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
就是一個很重要的

833
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
英文測驗

834
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
因為

835
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
大家如果到T1的學校

836
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
基本上在

837
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
學生的薪資

838
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
上面都會有足夠好的support

839
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
那

840
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
他們提供你financial support

841
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
的方法基本上就是

842
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
請你去當TA

843
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
TA就是所謂的teaching assistant

844
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
那你最主要的工作就是你必須要

845
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
跟

846
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
undergrad的學生做

847
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
做溝通

848
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
你就是助教

849
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
那你必須要有足夠好的英文表達能力

850
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
來幫助

851
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
大學生做學習

852
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
ok所以托福這一關

853
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
通常就是沒有辦法

854
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
每個學校

855
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
對於托福的要求

856
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
我覺得近年來有逐漸

857
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
上升的趨勢

858
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
那所以大家在準備的時候

859
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
我會建議多放一點心思

860
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
在托福上面

861
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
GRE我覺得趨勢

862
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
索然

863
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
大概以後會要求

864
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
GRE的學校會越來越少

865
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
ok下一張slide

866
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
ok那這個

867
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
就是當你進入

868
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
比如說進入我們系上的網站

869
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
之後然後你點一下

870
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
每一個學校他們都會有一個

871
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
所謂叫做frequently asked

872
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
question就是常問問題

873
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
就學生他們會一直提供的問題

874
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
那通常在

875
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
那個部分的話你會看到

876
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
系上會提供

877
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
非常特定的標準

878
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
ok

879
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
之前我在我們系上網站

880
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
截錄下來的那個時候GRE

881
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
還是一個required document

882
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
那在他們的

883
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
在我們的網站

884
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
上面他就會提供說ok

885
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
那基本上我們一定要

886
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
達到這些要求

887
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
比如說你托福必須要多少分

888
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
然後你的GRE必須要多少分

889
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
你才有資格

890
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
進入到GRE的search committee

891
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
來做review

892
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
要不然的話學校會直接把你的文件擋下來

893
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
你連進入被review

894
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
的資格都沒有

895
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
ok所以大家在

896
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
申請的時候必須要知道說

897
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
你是不是符合這些所謂的

898
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
hard requirement

899
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
不然的話就是你的申請就會石沉大海

900
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
根本沒有辦法被review

901
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
alright

902
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
next slide please

903
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
ok

904
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
那接下來我們要講一些

905
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
我個人認為最重要的document

906
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
ok叫做statement of purpose

907
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
當我自己年輕的時候

908
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
在申請學校的時候

909
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
當我在寫statement of purpose的時候完全不知道

910
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
我要寫什麼

911
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
ok那所以就亂寫

912
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
那當我就是

913
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
經歷過這麼多年

914
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
當這些審查的

915
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
委員之後

916
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
我總結了

917
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
就是一個好的statement of purpose

918
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
應該要包含

919
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
幾個元素

920
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
第一個元素

921
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
我覺得是motivation

922
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
ok基本上就是講說

923
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
你覺得為什麼你想要來申請

924
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
你的statement of purpose

925
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
那第二個元素呢

926
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
就是你必須要

927
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
正式的討論一下

928
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
你的GPA

929
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
ok那第三個就是

930
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
你必須要討論一下

931
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
你是不是有任何的research experience

932
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
ok那接下來大家可以看到

933
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
我後來寫了leadership

934
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
ok leadership基本上就講說

935
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
ok你有沒有跟

936
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
其他人在研究上面合作過

937
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
ok那最後一個

938
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
就是research interest

939
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
ok那

940
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
在你申請學校的時候

941
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
你的research interest

942
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
很重要因為你必須要

943
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
登入他們的網站

944
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
尋找你自己覺得有趣的老師

945
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
ok所以每個學校

946
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
都會不太一樣

947
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
你沒有辦法用同一封

948
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
statement of purpose

949
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
來投所有的學校

950
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
ok如果那是你打算

951
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
做的事情的話那基本上

952
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
你我個人

953
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
感覺就是你成功的機會

954
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
會比較低一些

955
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
那

956
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
回過頭來我們來細講

957
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
一下在這五個element裡面

958
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
你應該要寫什麼東西

959
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
ok像第一個說

960
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
motivation的話我覺得就直接

961
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
連回剛才楊教授講說

962
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
你要仔細的思考一下為什麼你想念博士班

963
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
ok

964
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
那

965
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
當然你不能寫說我就是

966
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
沒事情做所以我想念博士班

967
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
那不是一個好的不是一個

968
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
強而有力的

969
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
reasoning

970
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
ok所以大家在我想說為什麼在

971
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,440
一開始的時候

972
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
楊教授會

973
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
希望大家能夠好好思考一下

974
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
為什麼我要申請博士班

975
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
ok因為那在你的statement of purpose

976
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
裡面會是一個基本上

977
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
就是你的開頭會是一個很重要

978
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
的element

979
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
ok那第二個我寫說

980
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
academic performance最主要我寫這個

981
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
原因是因為有很多的學生

982
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
當然在求學

983
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
的時候ok很少學生

984
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
能夠在

985
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
八個學期都保持很好的

986
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
GPA

987
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
那我自己當例子就是

988
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
當我還年輕的時候

989
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
尤其是當我在大一的時候

990
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
我不是

991
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
一個很愛念書的學生

992
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
ok我的GPA非常

993
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
非常的差

994
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
那時候

995
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
差到

996
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
我自己也覺得

997
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
我如果那時候真的就是隨便寫的話

998
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
我一定申請不上學校

999
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
那

1000
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
如果說你也有類似的

1001
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
情況的話就是可能在你的

1002
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,440
求學生涯當中在大學的

1003
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
生涯你可能有一兩個學期

1004
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
就GPA非常的差

1005
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
ok那你必須要仔細

1006
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
思考一下

1007
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
要做一下解釋ok因為如果你

1008
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
不做解釋

1009
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
當reviewer看了你的CV

1010
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
再對照你的SOP

1011
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
你就開始直接思考一下

1012
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
ok這個學生為什麼沒有解釋一下

1013
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
你的成績在那個時候為什麼不好

1014
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
ok

1015
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
以我自己做例子的話

1016
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
我在大學的時候

1017
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
我的成績在大一大二是

1018
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
在我們班上是非常棒

1019
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
末段班的

1020
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
我們班上可能有60個學生

1021
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
我可能排名在50名左右

1022
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
我的GPA可能只有2點多

1023
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
對那

1024
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
可是我在我

1025
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
到大三大四的時候

1026
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
還有我的碩一碩的時候

1027
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
我可能是我們班上第一名第二名

1028
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
這樣子

1029
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
所以那個時候你就會發現

1030
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
我的case變成一個相對優異的case

1031
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
因為當我在討論我的GPA的時候

1032
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
我可以講說因為大一大二的時候

1033
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
我其實還不知道我自己想要做什麼

1034
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
ok所以我就是

1035
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
尋找自我

1036
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
放風一下

1037
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
那可是在大三大四

1038
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
我清楚認知知道說

1039
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
化學系是我的熱愛

1040
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
然後我決定要做一個化學老師的時候

1041
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
things get wrong right

1042
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
那這種情況就會是一個

1043
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
非常positive lead

1044
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
ok

1045
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
當你在探討你的GPA的時候

1046
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
當reviewer在看你的

1047
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
stem of purpose的話

1048
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
這就是一個大加分

1049
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
ok

1050
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
那最好的idea就是你永遠都是

1051
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
書卷獎

1052
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
那當然就是沒話講

1053
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
那這種情況的話

1054
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
你就只需要list你得過的獎有哪些

1055
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
這樣就可以了

1056
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
不過我覺得GPA是一個

1057
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
大家必須要思考一下

1058
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
解釋一下為什麼

1059
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
你的GPA長這個樣子

1060
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
那大家把你的GPA

1061
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
跟你現在想做的事情

1062
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
也就是申請PhD這件事情

1063
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
要做一個連結

1064
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
那另外可以幫你加分的

1065
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
內容呢

1066
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
就是所謂的research experience

1067
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
ok

1068
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
像我之前是念完碩士班

1069
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
我才出國念書

1070
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
所以在念碩士的時候

1071
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
其實我已經對很多

1072
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
常用的

1073
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
科學儀器相當

1074
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
熟悉了

1075
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
那有這種research experience

1076
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
是一個big plus

1077
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
原因是因為在美國申請的學生

1078
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
他們基本上都是從

1079
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
大學直接申請博士班

1080
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
碩士班這件事情

1081
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
在國外其實是不流行的

1082
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
所以因為他們

1083
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
直接從大學申請博士班

1084
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
所以很多的學生其實沒有

1085
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
足夠多的scientific training

1086
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
那如果說

1087
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
在你的求學過程中

1088
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
你已經做了很多的research

1089
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
那這個時候就會是一個

1090
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
big plus

1091
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
那這時候你就要好好的闡述一下

1092
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
你會什麼東西

1093
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
來證明說你已經是在

1094
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
在

1095
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
scientific training上面

1096
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
已經有足夠

1097
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
程度的成熟度

1098
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
所以如果你有這些

1099
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
你贏得一些award

1100
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
你做了一些presentation

1101
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
或你發表了一些paper

1102
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
這些都會是big plus

1103
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
那另外一個重點就是

1104
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
leadership

1105
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
這個事情其實是

1106
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
在國外雖然說

1107
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
美國很強調英雄主義

1108
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
可是當我們在審查

1109
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
一個PhD學生的時候

1110
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
我們其實更看重的是說

1111
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
這個學生是不是

1112
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
culturable

1113
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
是不是一個可造之材

1114
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
他能不能夠成為一個

1115
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
team member

1116
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
他能不能夠

1117
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
跟別人一起合作

1118
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
完成一個project

1119
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
可是在同時能夠有

1120
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
自己獨特的見解

1121
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
這些特質聽起來很

1122
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
相互矛盾

1123
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
可是in the end

1124
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
當你成為一個PhD的時候

1125
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
你必須要同時擁有這麼多不一樣的特質

1126
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
那要怎麼寫

1127
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
才會證明說

1128
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
才會demonstrate你是

1129
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
有一個leadership的人呢

1130
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
最好最好的

1131
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,440
例子我覺得就是

1132
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
如果說你有一些

1133
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
volunteer的experience

1134
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
那

1135
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
比如說你可能去醫院

1136
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
做個intern

1137
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
然後你跟那邊的人有什麼互動

1138
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
然後你做了什麼

1139
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
幫忙

1140
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
然後可能有什麼例子你可以寫說

1141
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
因為

1142
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
care about someone

1143
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
然後你提供了一些什麼意見

1144
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
解決了什麼事情

1145
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
這個就會是一個好的

1146
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
example

1147
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
那大家可以思考一下

1148
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
在日常生活中

1149
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
有沒有類似的這種例子

1150
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
那如果還沒有的話

1151
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
那如果你申請時間還很長的話

1152
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
那試著去尋找這些機會

1153
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
讓你可以把它寫在你的SOP裡面

1154
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
那最後一個呢我覺得也是一個

1155
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
很重要

1156
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
可是也很費時

1157
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
的一個component

1158
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
就是你identify

1159
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
有哪些實驗室是你自己覺得有興趣的

1160
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
那很顯然

1161
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
這件事情必須要每個學校都做

1162
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
就是會

1163
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
會非常的累

1164
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
所以如果說你做五個學校那就是必須要看

1165
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
至少要identify15個faculty

1166
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
ok

1167
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
可是這件事情會讓你的

1168
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
SOP非常非常的有

1169
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
吸引力

1170
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
尤其是當

1171
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
你喜歡的老師

1172
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
是他們系上

1173
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
決定

1174
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
誰可以admit

1175
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
可以決定

1176
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
admit哪一個graduate student的時候

1177
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
這個時候他就會

1178
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
非常非常的powerful

1179
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
所以我會建議說

1180
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
大家就是

1181
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
不要偷懶

1182
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
不要覺得累

1183
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
真的就是把你想要去的學校

1184
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
的那個系裡面的老師

1185
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
找三個出來

1186
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
現在基本上每一個老師都有自己的網站

1187
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
所以大家就是進去看一下

1188
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
建議你看一下他們最新的

1189
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
paper

1190
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
不要找一個paper是他可能10年之前published

1191
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
ok

1192
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
如果你準備做一件這種事情的話

1193
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
我會建議不要這樣子

1194
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
因為10年之前的research

1195
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
他現在research會差非常非常的大

1196
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
所以就read他們

1197
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
網站上面寫的東西

1198
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
加上就是這一兩年的paper就好了

1199
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
ok

1200
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
這樣子的話你就會有足夠多而且深刻

1201
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
的理解

1202
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
ok

1203
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
而且這樣子的話

1204
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
即使那個審理文件的老師

1205
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,440
不是你interested的老師

1206
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
他們也很有可能會refer給那些

1207
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
你有興趣的老師看一下

1208
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
如果那些老師覺得你qualify

1209
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
那你拿到admission的機會

1210
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
就會大大大大的增加

1211
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
ok

1212
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
所以我想這樣就是總結了

1213
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
這幾個key element

1214
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
for the study purpose

1215
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
下一張slide please

1216
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
ok

1217
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
最後一個就是所謂的recommendation letter

1218
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
ok

1219
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
這件事情呢我覺得在台灣

1220
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
的做法跟我在美國

1221
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
看到美國老師的做法

1222
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
差異性非常非常的大

1223
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
ok

1224
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
那我覺得很大的原因是因為

1225
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
大家平常沒有跟老師

1226
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
聊天的關係

1227
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
ok

1228
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
所以當你是一個學生的時候

1229
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
或是說當我是一個學生的時候

1230
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
我其實非常害怕跟老師聊天

1231
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
ok

1232
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,440
可是當你要出國的時候

1233
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
ok

1234
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
在台灣我現在的感覺就是

1235
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,440
老師都會叫學生先把

1236
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,440
recommendation letter

1237
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
的draft寫好

1238
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
然後他們再做一些minor的

1239
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
modification

1240
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
那通常學生做這件事情的時候呢

1241
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
基本上可能就是離你的deadline

1242
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
已經很近了

1243
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,440
那老師基本上不認識你

1244
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
你可能是他修課的學生

1245
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
你可能表現很好

1246
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,440
他知道你這個人可是他不知道你是誰

1247
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
他並不是真正真正

1248
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
深刻的了解你是誰

1249
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
他不了解你要做什麼

1250
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
他不了解what is your dream

1251
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
那在這種情況之下呢

1252
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,440
你自己draft a letter

1253
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,440
然後給老師簽

1254
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,440
然後老師寄給我們review

1255
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
那最常發生的情況就是

1256
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
我們看到這個letter覺得

1257
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
ok 這個letter

1258
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
非常的平淡

1259
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,440
ok

1260
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,440
那一旦我們發現這種很平淡的letter呢

1261
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
這個application

1262
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,440
的document基本上會先被放到

1263
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
ok

1264
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,440
secondary的pool

1265
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
ok 所以

1266
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
當你要一個recommendation letter的時候

1267
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
你要的不是一個平淡無奇的recommendation letter

1268
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
that doesn't help you

1269
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
ok

1270
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,440
sometimes it actually hurts you

1271
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,440
ok 當我們看到一個letter就是

1272
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
什麼都講了 可是好像什麼都沒講

1273
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
那我們這些reviewer呢

1274
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
就會試著去

1275
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
read between the lines

1276
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
ok

1277
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
那當你看很多

1278
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
當你審過來一兩百份這種letter的時候

1279
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,440
你就很清楚知道說

1280
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,440
ok

1281
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
老師其實不是真的想要推薦你

1282
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,440
那如果老師不是真的想要推薦你的話

1283
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,440
那我們就只好順從老師的意見

1284
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,440
把你放到我們比較

1285
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,440
不喜歡的那個category

1286
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
ok 所以你要怎麼準備你的

1287
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
recommendation letter呢

1288
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
第一個就是你要prepare early

1289
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
prepare early是early

1290
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
early到老師真的認識你

1291
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
ok

1292
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
有很多我的學生在他們大二的時候

1293
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
就開始來跟我們

1294
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
開始來跟我talk

1295
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
開始來跟我討論說

1296
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
他們之後做什麼

1297
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,440
ok 那像這種學生

1298
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,440
當他們到大三大四的時候

1299
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
來跟我要letter的時候

1300
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,440
我完全知道說ok

1301
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,440
這個學生的特質是什麼

1302
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,440
ok 那我就會很認真的幫他寫letter

1303
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
ok

1304
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
可是也有學生就是這種

1305
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
比較不知道這個process

1306
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
他可能在申請的前一個月

1307
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
來跟我要letter

1308
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
ok

1309
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,440
那第一個我不認識這個學生

1310
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
然後第二個

1311
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,440
一個月對我而言

1312
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
對老師而言

1313
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,440
一般來講

1314
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,440
對教授而言

1315
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,440
一個月是一個非常非常短的時間

1316
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,440
ok

1317
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,440
ok

1318
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,440
ok

1319
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,440
ok

1320
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
所以我會建議你

1321
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,440
一旦你有決定你要出國的時候

1322
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
