00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
然後呢他同時有Collaborate跟Microsoft Taiwan Collaborate就是相關就是Medical System的研究

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
那他的這個Doctoral Research主要是就是今天的主題Blockchain

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
然後呢他除此之外他也對比如說IoT Edge Computing Security還有AI都有涉獵而且是非常有興趣

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
那除此之外在這個主要研究之外呢

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
然後呢他非常鼓勵台灣的學生可以跳出舒適圈追尋他們的夢想

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
好那我這邊先關掉

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
今天劍之要給我們帶來的演講題目是

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
An Implementation of Fake News Prevention by Blockchain and Entropy-Based Incentive Mechanism

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
那麻煩大家現在把麥克風打開

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
因為我們的麥克風現在預設是關掉的

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
先把麥克風全部打開

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
然後我們用熱烈的掌聲來歡迎我們今天的講者為我們帶來精彩的演講

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
好那交給你了

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you everyone

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And thanks 劍勇

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I originally thought I use the Chinese to give a speech

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I promised my English workshop to give an English presentation

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I still use English to give my presentation

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But if you have any question

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Feel free to ask in Chinese or English

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Both are fine

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I'm so glad to give you this presentation

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's about we use blockchain technique to come back with the fake news

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But before into the research

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I would like to introduce my background and to let you understand me more

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So this is my background

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Actually I'm born in Taiwan

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And when I graduated, I worked in Taiwan for several years

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And as you can see, I originally in Hsinchu

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And then I go back to Taipei and do some software development

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And then I go to the banks

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Issan Bank and China Trust

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then before I joined UW

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I collaborated with Microsoft Taiwan as a technical consultant

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And my educational background is that

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm a computer science master degree in National Taiwan Ocean University

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And for this part is that I introduced that in my master thesis

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We developed some facial recognition system

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That you could input the sentences and your image

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And then our system could to generate animation like you

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And this animation can say some sentences

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So it's pretty interesting

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And as you can see right now

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
A lot of application like this published very famous

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So yeah, it's a life is a joke

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If we put this product on the market

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Maybe I'm a millionaire now, right?

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And if I graduated and, you know, for engineering students

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Seniors told you, you could go to the Hsinchu to get a job

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And then you can get a lot of stocks

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then you can retire very soon

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So it was my dream

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So when I graduated, I went to Hsinchu

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But, you know, in that year, we met some financial crisis

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So I came back to Taipei to do software development

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And at that time, I was very interested in mobile development

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And in that generation, in that year

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The Microsoft collaborated with the Nokia to deliver the new devices

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's the Nokia and the Windows phone on the market

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So I joined one company

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We as a manager and a team to develop some mobile apps

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
As you can see, yeah, the interesting one is the repost

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We transfer the Nokia's games

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a Barbie game, right?

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you're a child, you use this app

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can change the process of the app to us in this games

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We transfer it from the iPhone and Android system to Windows phone

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And then we do some application

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We do some applications for, you know, the care, right?

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And tool for the Taiwan taxi and also for the easy taxi

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All these applications, I was so excited that I did this application

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because, you know, in apps, if you are a programmer

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The apps could give you a very straightforward feedback from customers

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So it's very interesting

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
However, the life gave me another joke

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is that the Windows phone did not succeed at that time

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So, yeah, after I did this job for more than one year

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I found that, yeah, no, this job cannot help me to

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Enough money for me to buy, yeah

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I joined to banks and to run the directives

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Some financial products and we built a system

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's called the Muiris

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And this Muiris is a very powerful system

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
At the banking operations

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you are a trader, you could use this system

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
To record any financial products in this system

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And all the Taiwan, the first tier, the banks use this system

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So I went to China Trust

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then I went to Hunter

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Invite me to join Yishan Bank to introduce Muiris to their banks

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And then when I finished this Muiris project

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, we made a big project in Taiwan

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Is that the Asian Pacific Organization came to Taiwan

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They do some resource to how does Taiwan do

109
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In the anti-money laundry, which is a fine system

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And so when I, I was kidding that

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So, yeah, I'm one of the Taiwan representative

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The national teams in Taiwan is very honored for us

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But it's really tough to do that

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We need to finish it out of the requirements in a very short time

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But, yeah, the final result is very good

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I also got a promotion in Yishan Bank

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So far, it looks so good

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So why I want to go study abroad

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's because that I was thinking about that

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If I still stay in Taiwan, right

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Maybe I could gather good jobs and to be promoted

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Continue to be promoted

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But, yeah, I was very

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I heard about some great new technology skills

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Or some new products from Silicon Valley

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Or from North America

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So it was always be my dream to study abroad

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So I was so hesitate

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But, yeah, I just to give myself a chance to do this

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And so right now I was thinking about that

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The thing is that if you have a dream

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It only could stop you, it's just yourself

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So I just want to encourage all of my friends

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Or the participants or some young students in this meeting

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You could to just to check your dreams

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Or not to limit yourself

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And so right now I'm here in Canada

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So I saw a lot of beautiful things

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But, yeah, the period is also

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
When I prepare for this study process

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I met a lot of difficulties

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But, yeah, it's worth it, I think

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And, yeah, this is my

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A lot of my motto is that

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Actually adventure may hurt you

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But monotony, which means that you always do the same things

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It will kill you, kill you creative or other things

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So, yeah, that's all my background introduction

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So I will stop here for a while

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you have any question, you could ask me right now

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:11,000
OK, I think you have any question

152
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Feel free to ask me and we can discuss more

153
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And so I wrote some of my experiences in my blog

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And some medium if you have

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You could check it and to get more detail

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you also want to trust your dreams

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Or you have some dream career

158
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Or you could also find me on those pages

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And, yeah, we could discuss more about your passion

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And, OK, so let's get to our main research topic today

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Today we're going to talk about

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How to use the blockchain to prevent the fake news

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, actually what is the fake news

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It is a complete fabrication

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Which means people to forge something

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Or to mimic something

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And they're very similar to the real

168
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You are not able to confirm what the fact is

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What is the real, what is the fact

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And so what is the

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Actually the spread of fake news

172
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is not in the long future

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It happens right now

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You could see this slide

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In the left-hand upside

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is the U.S. stock market

177
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
In one day you could see the picture

178
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It drops sharply

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But why

180
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because at that day

181
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The news says that the Trumps

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The Obama was dead

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But it's a rumor, right

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But however the stock market to drop very sharply

185
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
By this fake news

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And other examples in this slide

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We all know that the Cambridge Analytic

188
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They collect the users' preferences

189
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And to make some news or articles

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That you are interested in

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And to affect your opinion in some specific issues

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And also the Russian

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
They use some propagandas to affect the basis

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The resource of basis

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So all these are the current threat

196
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
To our society and democracy and the economy

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Also in Taiwan

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Taiwan is the same

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Actually in the research

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Taiwan is the most

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We got the most threat from the whole world

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We are number one

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So it's very

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like I said

205
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's not a long

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Not a threat in a long distance

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's the current

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It happened currently right now

209
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So why people invest in fake news

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That is because they can get a lot of revenues

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Based on the lower cost

212
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Right now the cost of producing the fake news

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's very cheap

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But if you can affect a big topic

215
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like the U.S. president election

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Or some very huge topic

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You could get a huge, huge revenues

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So why not

219
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why don't we do that

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If I can impact a lot of people

221
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
By very low cost

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Actually the malicious people

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Of course they will do that

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And also the AI technology makes things worse

225
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because in my this slide

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is Jordan Peele

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He is a U.S. actor

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He collaborated with technology companies

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They use the AI technique to

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The deep fake technique to produce the video

231
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And to let Obama to say some words

232
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They want him to say

233
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So AI make the fake news

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
To be produced more easier

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And so

236
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But in a traditional ways

237
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Our research mainly focus on

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
To detect the fake news automatically

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How we do that

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You see this picture that

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
We have different algorithms

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But mainly we use some machine learning algorithms

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We find some clues

244
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
For example if you are the fake news comes in

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And we find whether the IP address is correct or not

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And its content has some

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We use this or not

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So we use some patterns to detect

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And to decide whether this fake news is

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Whether this news is correct or not

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But like I said

252
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AI makes things very similar to real

253
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The algorithms does not have

254
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Have the great performance right now

255
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So some big companies like Google

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Or Facebook

257
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They begin to use some

258
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Human beings power capabilities to

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Help AI to check the contents

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Authenticity

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
How they do that

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They build some teams

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They collaborate with the local professions

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They have the ability to check the content

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Is correct or not

266
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And Facebook also did the same things

267
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They built a team internal

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And those teams will check some news

269
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The authenticity

270
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And to make your

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Some news

272
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
When news push to your device

273
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They will be real

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And they will build some fake news

275
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And in Taiwan

276
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We also have one organization

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And you could see that

278
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's the Taiwan Fact Check Center

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And you could go on their website

280
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And to see

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They could check

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
They will check some news

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And tell you this is correct or incorrect

284
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
OK

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So I stop here

286
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And for these solutions

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Like Google or Facebook

288
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Or the Taiwan Fact Check Center

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Those are good solutions

290
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But these solutions are

291
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Are managed by a central organization

292
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
We don't know how they work

293
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's like a black box

294
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If they did not do this job well

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You did not know right

296
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You just can trust them

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So in our solution

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We used decentralized solutions

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Which means that we will form a team

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Form a call

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
A lot of people

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They are advisors

303
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They will verify some contents

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But this solution does not manage

305
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
By only one company

306
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's managed by everyone

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Who joined this system

308
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So this is our paper

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And just accepted by DTN

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
2021 in November

311
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So after the meeting

312
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If you have more interesting details

313
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You could

314
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But it's not published yet

315
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Maybe in December

316
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So in December

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You could check this content

318
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In more detail

319
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ok so

320
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think we can get into the detail

321
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So for

322
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This work is from another paper

323
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That invented by some researchers

324
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
In the UK

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
As you can see

326
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In the middle of this architecture

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There is a group

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That we call the uprising actors

329
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
These are some professions

330
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They have ability to check

331
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The content is correct or not

332
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And in that side

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
When the content creator

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Is the content creators

335
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Are people who create

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The digital content

337
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Maybe you are a writer

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Or you are a photographer

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And you make some content

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And you could send your content

341
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Into our system

342
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And then those uprising actors

343
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Will verify your content to check

344
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Or your content is real or fake

345
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And then they will send back to you

346
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The uprising result

347
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then those uprising result

348
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Will be saved in the

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Blockchain network

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
After that

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The right-hand side users

352
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
When it comes into our system

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They could check the

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Authenticity of the contents

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
From our blockchain network

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So that's an overview

357
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Architecture of the system

358
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Our system's architecture

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Is similar to this architecture

360
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But in the following slide

361
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I will introduce the differences

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Between architecture and this

363
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And this is interesting

364
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Like I said

365
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If we all rely on

366
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Facebook or Google

367
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
To help us to check the content

368
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
How do I know

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
They do their job very well

370
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Maybe they just have to

371
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They did not do very seriously

372
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So I still could still see some fake news

373
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But in this system

374
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You could to select the people

375
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Or some authorities media

376
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You trust

377
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And then to get them

378
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
To be your oppressing actors

379
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So for example

380
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If in this case

381
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I selected

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
One is the BBC

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's a media

384
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And I also selected some people

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Professor Smith or Mr. John

386
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Maybe some celebrities you trust

387
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If they say this news is real

388
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You will trust that

389
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So maybe for example in Taiwan

390
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Maybe you are very

391
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Trustful

392
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If he say this news is real

393
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay, I will trust him

394
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So you could select these people

395
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
To be your trusted parties

396
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And when the news comes in

397
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We will call your call

398
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
A group of oppressing actors

399
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
They will give you the opinion

400
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But is this news is correct or not

401
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And so but

402
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Why we need to use the blockchain

403
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
In the system

404
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Why don't we just use

405
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The traditional databases

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We just accept the oppressing results

407
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We don't need to use the blockchain, right

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But actually blockchain

409
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Has some characteristic

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That if once your data

411
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is accepted in blockchain

412
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You cannot modify that

413
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Because everyone has one ledger

414
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
In their node

415
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is this not possible

416
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
To modify all the ledgers, right

417
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And another case is that

418
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
If you modify the ledger

419
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
In only one node

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It will be easier to be fine

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Because we have some

422
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hashtag

423
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
In computer science

424
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The hashpoint is that

425
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
For example, in my node

426
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I have a hashpoint to point to your node

427
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But if you modify

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The hashpoint is based on your content

429
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If you modify the content

430
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The hashpoint will be modified

431
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So it will be easier to be found that

432
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Somebody modified the data

433
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So blockchain will be a great solution

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
To maintain the correctness of the data

435
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And we go back to give you some knowledge

436
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
How does the blockchain work

437
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Actually you can see this picture

438
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And if you have a transaction

439
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
In this system

440
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And the nodes will compete

441
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
To try to verify it

442
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And once this data verified

443
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You will be set to the blockchain

444
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That is in a button

445
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We have some red blocks

446
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And they are picked by the hashpoint

447
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Right

448
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So this is how the blockchain works

449
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then it's just

450
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There are many, many blockchains right now

451
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So it's a very simple classification

452
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
One is the public

453
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And another is the private

454
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Public means that everyone

455
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And could to send a transaction

456
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
In this blockchain network

457
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Like bitcoin

458
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
People know about bitcoin and all

459
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But in private blockchain

460
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Only people approved

461
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Will be can send the transaction

462
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Into the system

463
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And so this private blockchain

464
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Often be used in the corporations

465
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Not for the public

466
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And yeah so

467
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And another

468
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Since you need to know in blockchain

469
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Is the proof of work

470
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And proof of stake

471
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What is proof of work

472
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It means that

473
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If we have a transaction

474
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And we have a lot of nodes

475
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Which node can record

476
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
This data into blockchain

477
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And if you are proof of work mechanism

478
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The nodes will compete

479
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
To solve a complicated math problem

480
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And this process

481
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We call it the mining

482
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Right so it's a famous word

483
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Or it's very popular to be heard

484
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
If you solve this problem

485
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Then you get the right

486
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
To set data into blockchain

487
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But yeah and the proof of work

488
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Is right now the blockchain

489
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And the ethereum used

490
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And the proof of stake is that

491
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Oh no we don't

492
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
To solve the math problem

493
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We just use some stake

494
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What does that mean

495
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Is that if you want to

496
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Record data into blockchain

497
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You need to pay some fees

498
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And if you pay higher

499
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You will be get higher chance

500
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
To get the right

501
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
To be selected to get the right

502
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
To set data into blockchain

503
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So these two solutions

504
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Are called resist the hackers

505
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Because in the proof of work

506
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We want to control

507
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Our right to record data

508
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
In blockchain

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You need to control

510
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
More than 51% computers in the world

511
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And in proof of stake

512
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You need to pay more than 51% stakes

513
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Then you will get the right

514
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
To record data

515
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And then so you can see that

516
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
In blockchain actually

517
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I think people heard about

518
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
One news is in Taiwan

519
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That one day some people

520
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Buy a lottery right

521
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Then they collect a lot of people

522
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
People to buy the lottery together

523
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But one man denied

524
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
He denied that

525
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Said oh no this lottery

526
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Only belongs to me

527
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But if you use blockchain

528
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The solution the problem

529
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Will not exist

530
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because in blockchain

531
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Everything will

532
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Very transparency

533
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And we could trust

534
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Who did the transaction

535
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So that's the one

536
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The blockchain could support

537
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Our daily life

538
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Actually they can solve

539
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
A lot of things

540
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Like if you're trying to vote in

541
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Or to test some

542
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The fishery or some products

543
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The original prices of the product

544
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
By using a blockchain

545
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And then in this system

546
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You could

547
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I would like to introduce

548
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The hyperledger fabric

549
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's the blockchain that

550
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Proposed by IBM

551
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And this is the permission

552
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Private blockchain that I said

553
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's for the companies

554
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Not for the public

555
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And how they work

556
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You could see this flow

557
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
If you have a transaction

558
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You could propose to

559
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The execution chain code

560
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The chain code is the smart contract

561
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
In the blockchain network

562
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I think people will

563
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Heard about smart contract

564
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Often very often

565
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And then the smart contract

566
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Will check your content

567
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
To check is there any mistake

568
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
In your content

569
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And then send back to you

570
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And when you get a permission

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You can send your

572
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Submit your transaction

573
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
To the ordering services

574
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And then the ordering services

575
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Will to decide

576
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
How to record your data

577
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Into the blockchain

578
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And it's different to the bitcoin

579
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The hyperledger fabric

580
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Does not use the

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Proof of work mechanism

582
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Which means that

583
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Then we don't need to spend

584
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
A lot of energy or money

585
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
To do the mining process

586
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So it will be faster

587
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And save energy

588
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Than the blockchain

589
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Than the bitcoin

590
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So for this

591
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
In our paper

592
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is our main architecture

593
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The main difference is that

594
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You could see that

595
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
In the data persistent layer

596
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Our blockchain

597
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We use the hyperledger fabric

598
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But in a previous work

599
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That did not mention that

600
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Which blockchain they used

601
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Also we

602
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
How do you incentive

603
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
To let the oppressing actors

604
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
To do things well

605
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We invented incentive mechanisms

606
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
To that people

607
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Willing to do things very well

608
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Not to produce some dishonest

609
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Behaviors

610
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And then our system will

611
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Tell you that

612
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
If you send

613
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The content creator

614
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Send one content into our system

615
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Our system will tell you

616
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
How much percent

617
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
This content is real or fake

618
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Like this slide shows

619
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The content is the

620
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
66% is real

621
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And 80% is fake

622
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And this opinion is from

623
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The people you trust

624
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
In your trust list

625
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So you could use this

626
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Oppressing result to judge

627
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
This news is fake or not

628
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And so this is our main floor

629
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And we

630
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We was

631
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We refer to the history and that

632
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
In the beginning

633
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Our system will accept

634
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The participant to add some

635
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So they will get

636
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Some credit point

637
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And then they can use the

638
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Credit point to

639
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Do some oppressing

640
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And then we can get a trust score

641
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And then

642
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
When we get a trust score

643
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So we could

644
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
For example

645
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
In the previous

646
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
This example

647
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Most of the majority thinks that

648
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
This content is real

649
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So the minority

650
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Why this minority

651
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Think this content

652
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Is fake

653
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So our system will give reward

654
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
To those people

655
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That are

656
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Belongs to the majority

657
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And to get the punishment

658
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
To people who are in the minority

659
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Right

660
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Because

661
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
All people are professions

662
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Why you think this

663
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Content is fake

664
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Not correct

665
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Not similar to the majority's opinion

666
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And then before I get into

667
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
How to calculate the trust score

668
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I want to introduce one concept

669
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Is that

670
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
We call it entropy

671
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And

672
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah, don't

673
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Don't think it too complicated

674
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't want to

675
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Introduce some to

676
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Academia or some to top

677
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Concept

678
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You can only see that

679
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
This concept is from the

680
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Chemistry

681
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And from

682
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah

683
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Example is that

684
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
If you have a glass of water

685
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And you put ink into water

686
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The water will

687
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The ink will

688
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
From one point

689
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And will spread to everywhere

690
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Right

691
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So entropy is to

692
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Measure this phenomena

693
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
All the things

694
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Is it a disorder or not

695
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
If the entropy is high

696
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because

697
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It means that

698
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The things is more disorder

699
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I could put here

700
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And so

701
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
In this slide

702
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You could see that

703
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The red point

704
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Is really, really similar to

705
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You could imagine that

706
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The one red point is one people

707
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
If their opinion are the same

708
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's just like the low entropy, right

709
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They will

710
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Stay together very closely

711
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But if their opinion divergent

712
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
They will have high entropy, right

713
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So their opinion will not the same

714
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So

715
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I will continue

716
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Begin to tell you

717
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
How we calculate the trust score

718
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And I will put some equations there

719
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But you don't need to

720
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
To look very detail into equations

721
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You just need to look at the numbers

722
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Okay

723
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But for this example

724
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
If we have five prices

725
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And three of them agree

726
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And two of them reject

727
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So we could get that

728
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The possibility of real

729
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Is three divided by

730
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Based on

731
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This is the possibility

732
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And this is three

733
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Divide five, so it's 0.5

734
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And p fact will be two

735
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Divided five will be 0.4

736
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And then we put this

737
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The p real and p fact into this equation

738
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Then we can get the entropy for this case

739
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Will be 0.70

740
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay

741
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Just remember the number

742
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And

743
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Another case is that if we have

744
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The four prices agree

745
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Only one

746
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Reject

747
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You could get that

748
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
In this case, the people have the

749
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
More consistent opinion, right

750
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So the entropy will lower

751
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And in the example one

752
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The entropy is higher

753
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So our system encourage people to

754
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Let their opinion consistent

755
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So when the high

756
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
High entropy, our reward or

757
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Punishment

758
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Will lower

759
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But in the

760
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
In the example two

761
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Our reward and the punishment

762
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Will be higher

763
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So I will give you a table

764
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And to show you how we calculate

765
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
The trust score

766
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And so

767
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
If you remember the metaphor

768
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I said before

769
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
In the beginning

770
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
This is of five people

771
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And

772
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah, they have some opinions

773
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
In the specific news

774
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And their initial stakes is that

775
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
A1 put 5000

776
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Into the system

777
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
A2 put 1000

778
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And then the total stakes is the 21000

779
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And you could get the

780
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
The credit point or appraiser

781
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And there is the 5000

782
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
To divide the 21000

783
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So we could get the

784
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Each appraiser's credit point

785
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Of

786
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Credit point of appraiser

787
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Right

788
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So it's just a simple

789
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Simple math

790
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay, so

791
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We right now we have

792
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Know how the

793
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Credit point

794
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Of the appraiser

795
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And then

796
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
When they get

797
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
When the appraiser get opinion to the content

798
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
They could say that

799
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh, I'm 100%

800
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Sure that this news is fake

801
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Or real or fake

802
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But like A2

803
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
He could also say that

804
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh, this content is a little bit tough for me to judge

805
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So I just have the 70% confidence

806
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That it is true

807
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So our trust score

808
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Will be the CPOA

809
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
To multiply the confidence

810
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So you could see that

811
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
This SOA is the score of authentic

812
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Is the all people agrees

813
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And their SOA

814
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The summation of the all the SOA

815
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And here is the sum score of fake

816
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Is the same as the score of authentic

817
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And we also summation

818
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
All the people disagree

819
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And the summation their SOA

820
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
To get the final result

821
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So that's the trust

822
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
How we calculate the trust score

823
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And then when we know the trust score

824
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Like I said, our system will decide

825
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Will reflect the reward or punishment to each appraisers

826
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And we define that our basic reward

827
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Is the total stake to modify the 0.1%

828
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So in this case

829
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Will be 21

830
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And the basic punishment will be higher

831
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
More higher than the reward

832
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Because we want to stop the malicious nodes

833
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So the basic punishment will be total stake

834
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Multiply the 10%

835
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So it will be the 2100

836
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And then the reward of the content

837
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Which means that when once content comes in

838
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And how many reward

839
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We will reflect to all the appraisers

840
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Who did their jobs

841
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So our equation will be

842
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We use the basic reward to modify

843
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The value of the 1 to minus the entropy S

844
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So you could see that in this case

845
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We know that in our example 1

846
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Our entropy is 0.97

847
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So the ROC or POC will be 6.3 and 6.3 respectively

848
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Okay

849
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So then we know that the basic reward

850
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And we know the reward of content

851
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And the punishment of content

852
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And how we reflect to each appraiser

853
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And we will calculate the ratio of SOA

854
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Which means that

855
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
For example, in SOA, we have the 0.66

856
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And for A1, we will know that

857
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
There are 36% of the trust score

858
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
The score of authentic is come from

859
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Is come from the appraiser 1

860
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So we will use this ratio to reflect

861
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The reward to each appraiser

862
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And for the punishment is the same

863
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We will know that

864
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
How you contribute to the trust of the fake

865
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And then if you contribute

866
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Or you occupy more percentage

867
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You will get more reward or more punishment

868
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Okay

869
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So in here, you can see

870
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We calculate the ratio of ROC and the ratio of POC

871
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Which each appraiser need to be reflected

872
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It will be added or be reduced

873
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And then when we reflect it

874
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You can see that for, for example, in for A1

875
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The initial, its initial state is 5,000

876
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And after state is the 5,000 point 23

877
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So we could get all the after states

878
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And then we can calculate the after credit point

879
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So this is a cycle

880
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
When every content, when we finish the appraising process

881
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We will have the new states and the new credit point

882
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And then they will get ready to accept another content

883
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And if any appraiser

884
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Their credit point is close to zero

885
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Which means that their stakes are heavy

886
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
They got a lot of the punishment

887
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And their credit point

888
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Their stakes is equal to zero

889
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And we will go back to our main flow

890
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The initial process that to accept

891
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
To ask this appraiser

892
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Do you need to add more stakes

893
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
To continue to be the appraiser

894
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So that's how

895
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So we only finish the

896
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I think that the most difficult part in our presentation

897
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Is to calculate the trust score

898
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And in this slide that we do some experiments

899
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That to improve

900
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
To prove that our system could be a scale

901
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
On a lot of the users

902
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You could see that

903
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And in the left side

904
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
The picture shows that our system could

905
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
In our testing environment

906
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
We use the four servers

907
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And the throughput is still goes well

908
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But in our system

909
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
We set the contents

910
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The maxima of the content is the eight megabytes

911
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Because you could imagine

912
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
If we compress the content

913
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
For videos or some

914
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We use the in-camera size

915
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
There is the technique

916
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You could use the content to

917
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
As the input

918
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And we have the output

919
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's a very short

920
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Screen or some contents

921
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And it will not to occupy a lot of size

922
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So our limitation of the content

923
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Would be the eight megabytes

924
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And the right-hand side

925
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The picture shows that

926
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We all know that the computer system

927
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Is rely on the fault tolerance

928
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Which means that

929
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
If the main server fails

930
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Our systems should still work well

931
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
You could see that

932
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
For example, you put a Facebook

933
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
One server crashed down

934
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And you cannot use the Facebook

935
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's not good

936
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So this is the right-hand side

937
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The picture shows that

938
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
If we make some server failure

939
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Our system still could work well

940
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And the latency will not to increase very much

941
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Okay, so I think we can get into conclusion

942
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So yeah, so our system

943
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I asked to summarize some take-home points

944
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
For all of you

945
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah, as you remember that

946
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I've said that the AI technique

947
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Is getting better and better

948
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So the traditional algorithms

949
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Does not get the great performance

950
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
To detect the fake news automatic

951
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So if we use the human's capabilities

952
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We will have a better solution

953
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Than the traditional AI algorithms

954
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But of course we could combine

955
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The advantage for the AI algorithms

956
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And the human-based capability

957
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
For example, we can use AI technique

958
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
To build the first layer of filters

959
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And people can get into

960
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
To check the results, right

961
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But the most important part

962
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Is the blockchain network

963
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Because it's decentralized

964
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Not to manage it by only one companies

965
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's transparency

966
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And very easier to find some data

967
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's being modified

968
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And so in this experience

969
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
We know that our system

970
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Is the architecture is peaceful

971
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And we could

972
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It has potential to be deployed

973
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
In thousands of machines

974
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And the most important part

975
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Is that our incentive mechanism

976
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Offers this architecture

977
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Commercial potential

978
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You could imagine that to

979
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
If you are a writer

980
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Or you are a photographer

981
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You could use our system

982
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
To get some proof

983
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That your content is real

984
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And your reputation

985
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Will getting better, right

986
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And you are a journalist

987
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Or you are some

988
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
If people doing a fact checking

989
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And you can get reward from our system

990
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So there is also

991
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Then this will have

992
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Get some commercial proof

993
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And for building

994
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
This is the

995
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Fact News Precision Systems

996
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Okay

997
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So that's for

998
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's a long presentation

999
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So I'll stop here

1000
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And I'll tell you here

1001
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Is that this research is

1002
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Supported by Ripple

1003
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Is the World Wide

1004
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Payment Protocol

1005
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And also by

1006
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
National Science and Engineering

1007
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Research Council of Canada

1008
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay

1009
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And also thanks my mentor

1010
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
To give me

1011
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
A lot of suggestions

1012
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And help when I

1013
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Study for and to

1014
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Find some research ideas

1015
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Or some

1016
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Know more people how to do well

1017
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
In a PhD program

1018
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So I will introduce

1019
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Her Facebook

1020
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And

1021
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
She wrote a lot of great things

1022
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
For all of you who wants to

1023
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Study for or you have some

1024
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
If you are women

1025
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That is the best

1026
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Facebook for you to check

1027
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So I put it here

1028
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And I want to thank

1029
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Catherine to be my mentor

1030
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And give me more

1031
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Help

1032
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay, so

1033
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That's all the presentation

1034
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And if you have a question

1035
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You could ask me right now

1036
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Or after the presentation

1037
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You could also drop me a mail

1038
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Or find me on

1039
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Or also

1040
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
We will discuss with you

1041
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
More detail or any questions you have

1042
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah, thank you so much

1043
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So yeah, actually

1044
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So before we start our Q&A session

1045
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Please turn on your microphones again

1046
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So let's thank

1047
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Jianzhi for the very interesting talk

1048
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Thank you, thank you

1049
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Okay, so

1050
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that

1051
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Some of our attendees

1052
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Would like to ask in Mandarin Chinese

1053
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Probably, I guess

1054
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But, I mean, any kind of language

1055
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
As long as you can communicate

1056
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That will all be fine

1057
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So, yeah

1058
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm happy to ask questions

1059
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Anyone?

1060
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Hello, hi

1061
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm Shanna

1062
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And I would like to know

1063
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Because I noticed that

1064
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Actually you have no experience

1065
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Studying abroad, right?

1066
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
This is your first time

1067
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah

1068
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
How do you practice English?

1069
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Sorry, it's not related to your content

1070
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But I'm just curious

1071
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah

1072
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Oh, yeah, it's an interesting question

1073
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Is that I think

1074
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I learned some English

1075
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Speaking practicing courses in UW

1076
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So, yeah, they gave me a lot of practice

1077
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,000
To

1078
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Try to join

1079
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Reach some

1080
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Course master

1081
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
The class near UW

1082
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So there's a lot of chance for me

1083
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Practicing English, yeah

1084
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Is that answer your question?

1085
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Oh, yes

1086
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And I heard some people said

1087
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That we should prepare

1088
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Maybe we should join the like

1089
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
UHSL

1090
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's faster than we prepare English fast

1091
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
How do you think about that?

1092
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
If I cannot reach the score

1093
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That my school wants

1094
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And did I need to apply for the language

1095
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
UHSL first or

1096
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I just prepare English

1097
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And until I get a score

1098
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Get a TOEFL, pass the TOEFL

1099
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And then apply for the language school

1100
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Right

1101
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I think this is

1102
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Another interesting question

1103
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Actually, I will suggest that

1104
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It depends if you

1105
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I will suggest to prepare English

1106
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And try your best to pass the TOEFL

1107
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Or IELTS in Taiwan

1108
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Because if you

1109
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Go study abroad

1110
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And you go to some language schools

1111
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
The cost is really

1112
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's very high

1113
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And then it will spend a lot of money

1114
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
But the most important thing

1115
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Is the but

1116
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
If you

1117
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Sometimes

1118
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Some people are struggling

1119
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
To pass the exams

1120
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So if you found that

1121
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
You cannot concentrate to

1122
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Prepare for the exam

1123
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And you stuck on the TOEFL exam

1124
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And also the schools offer

1125
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Some opportunities that

1126
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They say you could go to the university

1127
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
To take the language courses

1128
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And then you can get over

1129
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I would say you just go

1130
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Because the time is important

1131
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Do not to stuck one

1132
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
One stage for a long time

1133
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I think that would be my answer

1134
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Thank you, Tom

1135
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah, so I have a question

1136
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So if we go back to your title

1137
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I think you're saying that

1138
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
This technique is mainly for

1139
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
How do I say this

1140
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
For deploying against fake news

1141
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
But if you let the people decide

1142
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
What will be the thing that they recognize

1143
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
They basically just vote

1144
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Let's say Barack Obama just died

1145
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And if you let the internet vote

1146
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Probably 99% of the people will say

1147
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That's a fake news

1148
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But let's say objectively true thing

1149
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
That cannot be voted to become a truth

1150
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
In your system

1151
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
How do you comment about that

1152
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah, like I said

1153
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
We trust the majority opinion

1154
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
In our system

1155
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
We have the reward and punishment mechanism

1156
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
To make you to do the correct

1157
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And the honest things

1158
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Actually in all of the blockchain network

1159
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They have the specific incentive mechanism

1160
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
To prevent from some malicious notes

1161
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So if you join our

1162
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
We have two mechanism to prevent

1163
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This the notes to adjust to vote

1164
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Actually they will do their best

1165
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Because the first if they join our system

1166
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
They need to pay for pay fees for

1167
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Like I said the stakes

1168
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So it's a cost

1169
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And then if we join system

1170
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And you did not do your job very well

1171
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
You will get the punishment

1172
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And then eventually

1173
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You will be prohibited

1174
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
To be the oppressors in our system

1175
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So our mechanism of incentive

1176
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Is core concept to incentive people

1177
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
To check the content seriously

1178
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And to vote correctly

1179
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So if I understand correctly

1180
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Basically the assumption

1181
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That you are going with

1182
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Is that people generally have good intention

1183
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And they are answering

1184
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Based on their good intention

1185
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Regardless of the truth

1186
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So say Obama just died

1187
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Nobody knows

1188
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And they basically just like saying

1189
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It's not a good news

1190
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Because it's just not the thing

1191
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That is well established that I know

1192
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But it's true

1193
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So in your system

1194
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It's basically working against

1195
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Malicious information

1196
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But not exactly news

1197
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Can I say that

1198
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I could say how to define the bad news

1199
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Is that the content should be correct

1200
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So when you say Obama is dead

1201
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
If it's not a truth

1202
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Our system will consider it is a bad news

1203
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But in my scenario

1204
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm saying what if he really just died

1205
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But nobody knows like 10 minutes ago

1206
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And I go out and say

1207
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Hey guys, he just died

1208
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That will be a fake news in your system

1209
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Because nobody knows

1210
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That's true

1211
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah, you're right

1212
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But if you say Obama is dead

1213
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But nobody knows

1214
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I would say that

1215
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
This situation is really

1216
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's extremely

1217
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
That's quite a situation news

1218
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah, so I think

1219
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Because those oppressing actors

1220
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Are very capable to check the contents

1221
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So if they hesitate to give some opinions

1222
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Their confidence will lower

1223
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So the trust score of the agree

1224
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Authentic and the fact

1225
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
They will be very similar

1226
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So our system will not treat it

1227
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
In your case as a very tend to be real

1228
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Or fake, it will be a bad news

1229
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But we could give you an objective opinion

1230
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
To check this content

1231
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I see

1232
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Okay

1233
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I do have some comment about the previous question

1234
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Just like

1235
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Okay

1236
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Okay, first, thank you for a nice talk

1237
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And for the tokenomics design

1238
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I think that's about how you make a dispute system

1239
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Because for now it's like a one-time votes

1240
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And you just get the result done

1241
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But if you see like

1242
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
In order for the prediction market

1243
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Just like if you predict

1244
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And like whether Obama will die between like 2021

1245
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And people at 2021 votes

1246
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Maybe 3% of the voters enough to get yes or no

1247
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But if you don't trust the result

1248
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You can put your stake against that voting result

1249
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And then more people need to vote

1250
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
If you stake like maybe 1% of the total token

1251
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Then all of the people need to vote

1252
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So I guess you need to kind of like refine

1253
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The appeal system or the tokenomics

1254
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Because I think the previous question is quite valid

1255
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Because you assume that like the majority vote

1256
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Will know the truth

1257
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But maybe it takes some time right

1258
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
So but if you like you want to label the news in 10 minutes

1259
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And definitely well it's hard to get information

1260
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
To propagate to like the society or the civilization

1261
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
To get people votes and get the correct result

1262
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So I guess you just need to have a dispute system

1263
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I guess

1264
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Yeah, sure

1265
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But like you said

1266
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah

1267
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
If you want to get news in just 10 minutes

1268
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
To see if it's correct or not

1269
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It will be difficult to achieve that

1270
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Because maybe like Elon said

1271
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
The news is not just known by minority people

1272
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But yeah, for this case

1273
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I think for previous the current solutions

1274
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I think people will have

1275
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Like we have put more stakes

1276
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Or we can to introduce more

1277
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
The sub-parties, the libraries

1278
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And we can ask their opinions

1279
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
So our speed will get in faster

1280
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah, well I do think this is a very interesting

1281
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Actually very valuable research

1282
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm just being curious

1283
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Yeah, so anyone has other questions

1284
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I have some questions

1285
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Do you really plan to launch this thing in a public chain

1286
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Because I was saying the past like two years

1287
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Hyperledger is not like really striving

1288
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And even though like the gas fee

1289
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And the transaction fee is an issue

1290
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
For like Bitcoin in Syria

1291
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But for the new generation

1292
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Like high throughput blockchain

1293
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Also support smart contract

1294
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Then it will be a much better platform

1295
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I would say

1296
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Because well Hyperledger is definitely more

1297
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Like clean and more permission

1298
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
But how to really scale the platform

1299
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I would say like public chain is still better

1300
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Than the permission chain

1301
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah, actually you are right

1302
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We plan to introduce some

1303
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Digital tokens in our system

1304
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Because we need to get the reward or punishment

1305
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So Ethereum will be the one choice

1306
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That we consider to transfer

1307
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
The Hyperledger to the Ethereum

1308
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And also there are other tokens

1309
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
That invented right now

1310
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
They have a great

1311
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Because the Ethereum and Bitcoin

1312
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Their speed is too slow

1313
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But there are lots of faster blockchain network

1314
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So we consider to

1315
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Yeah, like you said to transfer

1316
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
From the private blockchain to the public

1317
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Okay, thank you for applying

1318
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah, thank you

1319
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Okay, so one last time

1320
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Anybody has question

1321
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Okay, if not, please again

1322
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Really turn on your microphone

1323
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So let's thank our speaker again

1324
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
That's a very interesting talk

1325
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
