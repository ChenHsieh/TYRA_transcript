00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
我們今天非常非常榮幸呢能請到建智來跟我們談談就是他在blockchain相關的研究

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
那在讓建智開始這個他的演講之前呢先讓我介紹一下建智

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
建智或是大家可以叫他Joseph是這個University of Waterloo的PhD student

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
他現在在的系所呢是Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty of Engineering

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
然後呢在他來到這個University of Waterloo之前呢

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
他曾經在台灣就是帶領銀行的新創銀行團隊呢

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
這個做這個Banking System的這個程式設計

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
然後呢他同時有Collaborate跟Microsoft Taiwan Collaborate就是相關就是Medical System的研究

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
那他的這個Doctoral Research主要是就是今天的主題Blockchain

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
然後呢他除此之外他也對比如說IoT Edge Computing Security還有AI都有涉獵而且是非常有興趣

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
那除此之外在這個主要研究之外呢

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
他同時也有Volunteer在Mentor台灣的學生參加就是

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Sorry申請這個全世界的這個PhD Program

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
然後他也同時也有

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Sorry我看一下喔

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Sorry我中文英文翻譯有點問題

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
我只用英文唸好了

01:37.000 --> 01:47.000
Volunteer to mentor new graduate student in his department and the Taiwan Global Ambassador of UW's Office of Advancement

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
然後呢他非常鼓勵台灣的學生可以跳出舒適圈追尋他們的夢想

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
好那我這邊先關掉

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
今天劍之要給我們帶來的演講題目是

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
An Implementation of Fake News Prevention by Blockchain and Entropy-Based Incentive Mechanism

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
那麻煩大家現在把麥克風打開

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
因為我們的麥克風現在預設是關掉的

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
先把麥克風全部打開

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
然後我們用熱烈的掌聲來歡迎我們今天的講者為我們帶來精彩的演講

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
好那交給你了

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Thank you everyone

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And thanks 劍勇

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
I originally thought I use the Chinese to give a speech

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
But I promised my English workshop to give an English presentation

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
So I still use English to give my presentation

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
But if you have any question

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Feel free to ask in Chinese or English

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Both are fine

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
So I'm so glad to give you this presentation

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
It's about we use blockchain technique to come back with the fake news

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
But before into the research

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
I would like to introduce my background and to let you understand me more

03:13.000 --> 03:22.000
So this is my background

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Actually I'm born in Taiwan

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
And when I graduated, I worked in Taiwan for several years

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
And as you can see, I originally in Hsinchu

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
And then I go back to Taipei and do some software development

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And then I go to the banks

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Issan Bank and China Trust

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And then before I joined UW

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
I collaborated with Microsoft Taiwan as a technical consultant

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
And my educational background is that

03:56.000 --> 04:03.000
I'm a computer science master degree in National Taiwan Ocean University

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
And for this part is that I introduced that in my master thesis

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
We developed some facial recognition system

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
That you could input the sentences and your image

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
And then our system could to generate animation like you

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
And this animation can say some sentences

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
So it's pretty interesting

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
And as you can see right now

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
A lot of application like this published very famous

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
So yeah, it's a life is a joke

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
If we put this product on the market

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Maybe I'm a millionaire now, right?

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
And if I graduated and, you know, for engineering students

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Seniors told you, you could go to the Hsinchu to get a job

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And then you can get a lot of stocks

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Then you can retire very soon

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
So it was my dream

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
So when I graduated, I went to Hsinchu

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
But, you know, in that year, we met some financial crisis

05:17.000 --> 05:27.000
So I came back to Taipei to do software development

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
And at that time, I was very interested in mobile development

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And in that generation, in that year

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
The Microsoft collaborated with the Nokia to deliver the new devices

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
That's the Nokia and the Windows phone on the market

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
So I joined one company

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
We as a manager and a team to develop some mobile apps

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
As you can see, yeah, the interesting one is the repost

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
We transfer the Nokia's games

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It's a Barbie game, right?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
If you're a child, you use this app

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
You can change the process of the app to us in this games

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
We transfer it from the iPhone and Android system to Windows phone

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And then we do some application

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
We do some applications for, you know, the care, right?

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
And tool for the Taiwan taxi and also for the easy taxi

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
All these applications, I was so excited that I did this application

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Because, you know, in apps, if you are a programmer

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
The apps could give you a very straightforward feedback from customers

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
So it's very interesting

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
However, the life gave me another joke

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
Is that the Windows phone did not succeed at that time

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
So, yeah, after I did this job for more than one year

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
I found that, yeah, no, this job cannot help me to

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Enough money for me to buy, yeah

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
So I joined to banks and to run the directives

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Some financial products and we built a system

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
It's called the Muiris

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
And this Muiris is a very powerful system

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
At the banking operations

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
If you are a trader, you could use this system

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
To record any financial products in this system

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
And all the Taiwan, the first tier, the banks use this system

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
So I went to China Trust

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
And then I went to Hunter

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Invite me to join Yishan Bank to introduce Muiris to their banks

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
And then when I finished this Muiris project

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, we made a big project in Taiwan

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
Is that the Asian Pacific Organization came to Taiwan

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
They do some resource to how does Taiwan do

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
In the anti-money laundry, which is a fine system

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
And so when I, I was kidding that

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
So, yeah, I'm one of the Taiwan representative

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
The national teams in Taiwan is very honored for us

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
But it's really tough to do that

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
We need to finish it out of the requirements in a very short time

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
But, yeah, the final result is very good

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
And I also got a promotion in Yishan Bank

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
So far, it looks so good

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
So why I want to go study abroad

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
That's because that I was thinking about that

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
If I still stay in Taiwan, right

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Maybe I could gather good jobs and to be promoted

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Continue to be promoted

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
But, yeah, I was very

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
I heard about some great new technology skills

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Or some new products from Silicon Valley

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Or from North America

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
So it was always be my dream to study abroad

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
So I was so hesitate

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
But, yeah, I just to give myself a chance to do this

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
And so right now I was thinking about that

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
The thing is that if you have a dream

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
It only could stop you, it's just yourself

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
So I just want to encourage all of my friends

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
Or the participants or some young students in this meeting

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
You could to just to check your dreams

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Or not to limit yourself

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And so right now I'm here in Canada

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
So I saw a lot of beautiful things

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
But, yeah, the period is also

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
When I prepare for this study process

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I met a lot of difficulties

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
But, yeah, it's worth it, I think

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And, yeah, this is my

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
A lot of my motto is that

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Actually adventure may hurt you

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
But monotony, which means that you always do the same things

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
It will kill you, kill you creative or other things

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
So, yeah, that's all my background introduction

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
So I will stop here for a while

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
If you have any question, you could ask me right now

11:00.000 --> 11:11.000
OK, I think you have any question

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
Feel free to ask me and we can discuss more

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
And so I wrote some of my experiences in my blog

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
And some medium if you have

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
You could check it and to get more detail

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
If you also want to trust your dreams

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Or you have some dream career

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Or you could also find me on those pages

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
And, yeah, we could discuss more about your passion

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
And, OK, so let's get to our main research topic today

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Today we're going to talk about

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
How to use the blockchain to prevent the fake news

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, actually what is the fake news

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
It is a complete fabrication

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Which means people to forge something

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Or to mimic something

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
And they're very similar to the real

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
You are not able to confirm what the fact is

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
What is the real, what is the fact

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And so what is the

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
Actually the spread of fake news

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Is not in the long future

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
It happens right now

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
You could see this slide

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
In the left-hand upside

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Is the U.S. stock market

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
In one day you could see the picture

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
It drops sharply

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
But why

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Because at that day

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
The news says that the Trumps

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
The Obama was dead

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But it's a rumor, right

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
But however the stock market to drop very sharply

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
By this fake news

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And other examples in this slide

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
We all know that the Cambridge Analytic

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
They collect the users' preferences

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
And to make some news or articles

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That you are interested in

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
And to affect your opinion in some specific issues

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And also the Russian

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
They use some propagandas to affect the basis

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
The resource of basis

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
So all these are the current threat

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
To our society and democracy and the economy

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Also in Taiwan

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Taiwan is the same

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Actually in the research

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Taiwan is the most

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
We got the most threat from the whole world

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
We are number one

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
So it's very

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Like I said

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
It's not a long

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Not a threat in a long distance

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It's the current

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
It happened currently right now

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
So why people invest in fake news

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
That is because they can get a lot of revenues

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Based on the lower cost

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
Right now the cost of producing the fake news

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
It's very cheap

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
But if you can affect a big topic

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Like the U.S. president election

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Or some very huge topic

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
You could get a huge, huge revenues

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
So why not

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Why don't we do that

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
If I can impact a lot of people

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
By very low cost

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
Actually the malicious people

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
Of course they will do that

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
And also the AI technology makes things worse

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
Because in my this slide

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
This is Jordan Peele

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
He is a U.S. actor

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
He collaborated with technology companies

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
They use the AI technique to

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
The deep fake technique to produce the video

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
And to let Obama to say some words

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
They want him to say

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
So AI make the fake news

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
To be produced more easier

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
And so

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
But in a traditional ways

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Our research mainly focus on

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
To detect the fake news automatically

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
How we do that

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
You see this picture that

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
We have different algorithms

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
But mainly we use some machine learning algorithms

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
We find some clues

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
For example if you are the fake news comes in

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
And we find whether the IP address is correct or not

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
And its content has some

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
We use this or not

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
So we use some patterns to detect

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
And to decide whether this fake news is

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Whether this news is correct or not

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
But like I said

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
AI makes things very similar to real

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
The algorithms does not have

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Have the great performance right now

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
So some big companies like Google

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Or Facebook

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
They begin to use some

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Human beings power capabilities to

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Help AI to check the contents

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Authenticity

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
How they do that

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
They build some teams

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
They collaborate with the local professions

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
They have the ability to check the content

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Is correct or not

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And Facebook also did the same things

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
They built a team internal

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
And those teams will check some news

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
The authenticity

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And to make your

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Some news

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
When news push to your device

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
They will be real

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
And they will build some fake news

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
And in Taiwan

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
We also have one organization

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
And you could see that

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
It's the Taiwan Fact Check Center

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
And you could go on their website

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
And to see

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
They could check

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
They will check some news

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
And tell you this is correct or incorrect

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
OK

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
So I stop here

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
And for these solutions

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Like Google or Facebook

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Or the Taiwan Fact Check Center

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Those are good solutions

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
But these solutions are

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Are managed by a central organization

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
We don't know how they work

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
It's like a black box

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
If they did not do this job well

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
You did not know right

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
You just can trust them

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
So in our solution

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
We used decentralized solutions

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
Which means that we will form a team

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Form a call

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
A lot of people

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
They are advisors

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They will verify some contents

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
But this solution does not manage

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
By only one company

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
It's managed by everyone

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Who joined this system

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
So this is our paper

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
And just accepted by DTN

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
2021 in November

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
So after the meeting

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
If you have more interesting details

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
You could

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
But it's not published yet

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Maybe in December

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
So in December

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You could check this content

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
In more detail

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Ok so

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I think we can get into the detail

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So for

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
This work is from another paper

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
That invented by some researchers

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
In the UK

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
As you can see

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
In the middle of this architecture

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
There is a group

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
That we call the uprising actors

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
These are some professions

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
They have ability to check

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
The content is correct or not

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
And in that side

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
When the content creator

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Is the content creators

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Are people who create

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
The digital content

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Maybe you are a writer

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Or you are a photographer

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
And you make some content

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And you could send your content

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Into our system

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
And then those uprising actors

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Will verify your content to check

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Or your content is real or fake

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
And then they will send back to you

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
The uprising result

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Then those uprising result

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Will be saved in the

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Blockchain network

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
After that

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
The right-hand side users

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
When it comes into our system

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
They could check the

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Authenticity of the contents

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
From our blockchain network

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
So that's an overview

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Architecture of the system

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Our system's architecture

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Is similar to this architecture

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
But in the following slide

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
I will introduce the differences

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Between architecture and this

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
And this is interesting

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Like I said

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
If we all rely on

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Facebook or Google

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
To help us to check the content

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
How do I know

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
They do their job very well

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Maybe they just have to

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
They did not do very seriously

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
So I still could still see some fake news

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
But in this system

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
You could to select the people

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Or some authorities media

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
You trust

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
And then to get them

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
To be your oppressing actors

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
So for example

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
If in this case

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I selected

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
One is the BBC

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
It's a media

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
And I also selected some people

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Professor Smith or Mr. John

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Maybe some celebrities you trust

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
If they say this news is real

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
You will trust that

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
So maybe for example in Taiwan

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Maybe you are very

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Trustful

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
If he say this news is real

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Okay, I will trust him

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
So you could select these people

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
To be your trusted parties

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
And when the news comes in

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
We will call your call

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
A group of oppressing actors

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
They will give you the opinion

22:51.000 --> 22:59.000
But is this news is correct or not

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
And so but

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Why we need to use the blockchain

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
In the system

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Why don't we just use

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
The traditional databases

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
We just accept the oppressing results

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
We don't need to use the blockchain, right

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
But actually blockchain

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Has some characteristic

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
That if once your data

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Is accepted in blockchain

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
You cannot modify that

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
Because everyone has one ledger

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
In their node

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Is this not possible

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
To modify all the ledgers, right

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
And another case is that

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
If you modify the ledger

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
In only one node

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
It will be easier to be fine

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
Because we have some

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Hashtag

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
In computer science

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
The hashpoint is that

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
For example, in my node

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I have a hashpoint to point to your node

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
But if you modify

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
The hashpoint is based on your content

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
If you modify the content

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
The hashpoint will be modified

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
So it will be easier to be found that

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Somebody modified the data

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
So blockchain will be a great solution

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
To maintain the correctness of the data

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
And we go back to give you some knowledge

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
How does the blockchain work

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Actually you can see this picture

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
And if you have a transaction

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
In this system

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
And the nodes will compete

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
To try to verify it

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
And once this data verified

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
You will be set to the blockchain

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
That is in a button

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
We have some red blocks

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
And they are picked by the hashpoint

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Right

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
So this is how the blockchain works

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And then it's just

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
There are many, many blockchains right now

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
So it's a very simple classification

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
One is the public

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And another is the private

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Public means that everyone

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
And could to send a transaction

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
In this blockchain network

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Like bitcoin

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
People know about bitcoin and all

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
But in private blockchain

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Only people approved

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Will be can send the transaction

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Into the system

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
And so this private blockchain

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Often be used in the corporations

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Not for the public

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
And yeah so

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
And another

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Since you need to know in blockchain

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Is the proof of work

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
And proof of stake

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
What is proof of work

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
It means that

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
If we have a transaction

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And we have a lot of nodes

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Which node can record

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
This data into blockchain

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
And if you are proof of work mechanism

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
The nodes will compete

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
To solve a complicated math problem

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
And this process

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
We call it the mining

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Right so it's a famous word

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Or it's very popular to be heard

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
If you solve this problem

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Then you get the right

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
To set data into blockchain

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
But yeah and the proof of work

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Is right now the blockchain

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
And the ethereum used

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And the proof of stake is that

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Oh no we don't

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
To solve the math problem

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
We just use some stake

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
What does that mean

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Is that if you want to

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Record data into blockchain

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
You need to pay some fees

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And if you pay higher

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
You will be get higher chance

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
To get the right

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
To be selected to get the right

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
To set data into blockchain

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
So these two solutions

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
Are called resist the hackers

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Because in the proof of work

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
We want to control

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Our right to record data

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
In blockchain

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
You need to control

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
More than 51% computers in the world

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
And in proof of stake

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
You need to pay more than 51% stakes

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Then you will get the right

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
To record data

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And then so you can see that

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
In blockchain actually

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I think people heard about

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
One news is in Taiwan

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
That one day some people

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Buy a lottery right

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Then they collect a lot of people

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
People to buy the lottery together

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
But one man denied

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
He denied that

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Said oh no this lottery

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Only belongs to me

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
But if you use blockchain

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
The solution the problem

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Will not exist

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Because in blockchain

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Everything will

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Very transparency

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
And we could trust

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Who did the transaction

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
So that's the one

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
The blockchain could support

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Our daily life

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Actually they can solve

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
A lot of things

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Like if you're trying to vote in

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Or to test some

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
The fishery or some products

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
The original prices of the product

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
By using a blockchain

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And then in this system

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
You could

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
I would like to introduce

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
The hyperledger fabric

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
It's the blockchain that

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Proposed by IBM

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And this is the permission

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Private blockchain that I said

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
It's for the companies

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Not for the public

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And how they work

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
You could see this flow

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
If you have a transaction

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
You could propose to

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
The execution chain code

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
The chain code is the smart contract

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
In the blockchain network

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
I think people will

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Heard about smart contract

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Often very often

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And then the smart contract

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Will check your content

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
To check is there any mistake

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
In your content

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And then send back to you

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And when you get a permission

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
You can send your

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Submit your transaction

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
To the ordering services

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
And then the ordering services

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Will to decide

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
How to record your data

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Into the blockchain

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
And it's different to the bitcoin

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
The hyperledger fabric

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Does not use the

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
Proof of work mechanism

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Which means that

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Then we don't need to spend

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
A lot of energy or money

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
To do the mining process

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
So it will be faster

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
And save energy

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Than the blockchain

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Than the bitcoin

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
So for this

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
In our paper

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
This is our main architecture

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
The main difference is that

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
You could see that

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
In the data persistent layer

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Our blockchain

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
We use the hyperledger fabric

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
But in a previous work

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
That did not mention that

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Which blockchain they used

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Also we

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
How do you incentive

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
To let the oppressing actors

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
To do things well

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
We invented incentive mechanisms

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
To that people

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Willing to do things very well

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Not to produce some dishonest

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Behaviors

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
And then our system will

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Tell you that

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
If you send

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
The content creator

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Send one content into our system

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Our system will tell you

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
How much percent

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
This content is real or fake

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Like this slide shows

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
The content is the

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
66% is real

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And 80% is fake

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And this opinion is from

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
The people you trust

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
In your trust list

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
So you could use this

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Oppressing result to judge

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
This news is fake or not

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
And so this is our main floor

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
And we

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
We was

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
We refer to the history and that

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
In the beginning

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Our system will accept

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
The participant to add some

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
So they will get

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Some credit point

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
And then they can use the

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Credit point to

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Do some oppressing

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
And then we can get a trust score

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And then

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
When we get a trust score

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
So we could

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
For example

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
In the previous

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
This example

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Most of the majority thinks that

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
This content is real

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
So the minority

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Why this minority

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Think this content

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Is fake

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
So our system will give reward

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
To those people

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
That are

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Belongs to the majority

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And to get the punishment

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
To people who are in the minority

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Right

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Because

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
All people are professions

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
Why you think this

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Content is fake

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Not correct

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
Not similar to the majority's opinion

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And then before I get into

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
How to calculate the trust score

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
I want to introduce one concept

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Is that

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
We call it entropy

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
And

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Yeah, don't

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Don't think it too complicated

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I don't want to

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Introduce some to

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Academia or some to top

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Concept

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
You can only see that

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
This concept is from the

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Chemistry

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
And from

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Yeah

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Example is that

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
If you have a glass of water

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
And you put ink into water

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
The water will

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
The ink will

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
From one point

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
And will spread to everywhere

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Right

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
So entropy is to

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Measure this phenomena

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
All the things

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Is it a disorder or not

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
If the entropy is high

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Because

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
It means that

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
The things is more disorder

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I could put here

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And so

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
In this slide

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
You could see that

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
The red point

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Is really, really similar to

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
You could imagine that

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
The one red point is one people

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
If their opinion are the same

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It's just like the low entropy, right

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
They will

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Stay together very closely

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
But if their opinion divergent

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
They will have high entropy, right

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
So their opinion will not the same

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
So

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
I will continue

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Begin to tell you

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
How we calculate the trust score

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And I will put some equations there

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
But you don't need to

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
To look very detail into equations

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
You just need to look at the numbers

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Okay

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
But for this example

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
If we have five prices

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And three of them agree

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
And two of them reject

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
So we could get that

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
The possibility of real

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Is three divided by

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Based on

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
This is the possibility

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And this is three

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Divide five, so it's 0.5

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
And p fact will be two

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Divided five will be 0.4

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
And then we put this

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
The p real and p fact into this equation

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Then we can get the entropy for this case

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
Will be 0.70

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Okay

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Just remember the number

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
And

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Another case is that if we have

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
The four prices agree

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Only one

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Reject

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
You could get that

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
In this case, the people have the

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
More consistent opinion, right

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
So the entropy will lower

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
And in the example one

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
The entropy is higher

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
So our system encourage people to

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Let their opinion consistent

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
So when the high

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
High entropy, our reward or

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Punishment

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Will lower

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
But in the

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
In the example two

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Our reward and the punishment

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
Will be higher

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
So I will give you a table

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And to show you how we calculate

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
The trust score

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And so

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
If you remember the metaphor

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
I said before

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
In the beginning

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
This is of five people

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
And

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Yeah, they have some opinions

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
In the specific news

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
And their initial stakes is that

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
A1 put 5000

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Into the system

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
A2 put 1000

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
And then the total stakes is the 21000

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
And you could get the

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
The credit point or appraiser

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
And there is the 5000

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
To divide the 21000

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So we could get the

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Each appraiser's credit point

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Of

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Credit point of appraiser

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Right

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
So it's just a simple

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
Simple math

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Okay, so

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
We right now we have

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Know how the

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Credit point

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Of the appraiser

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
And then

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
When they get

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
When the appraiser get opinion to the content

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
They could say that

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Oh, I'm 100%

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
Sure that this news is fake

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Or real or fake

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
But like A2

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
He could also say that

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
Oh, this content is a little bit tough for me to judge

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
So I just have the 70% confidence

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
That it is true

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
So our trust score

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Will be the CPOA

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
To multiply the confidence

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
So you could see that

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
This SOA is the score of authentic

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Is the all people agrees

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And their SOA

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
The summation of the all the SOA

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
And here is the sum score of fake

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
Is the same as the score of authentic

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And we also summation

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
All the people disagree

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
And the summation their SOA

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
To get the final result

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
So that's the trust

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
How we calculate the trust score

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
And then when we know the trust score

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Like I said, our system will decide

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
Will reflect the reward or punishment to each appraisers

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
And we define that our basic reward

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
Is the total stake to modify the 0.1%

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
So in this case

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Will be 21

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
And the basic punishment will be higher

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
More higher than the reward

39:07.000 --> 39:12.000
Because we want to stop the malicious nodes

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
So the basic punishment will be total stake

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Multiply the 10%

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
So it will be the 2100

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
And then the reward of the content

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Which means that when once content comes in

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
And how many reward

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
We will reflect to all the appraisers

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Who did their jobs

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
So our equation will be

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
We use the basic reward to modify

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
The value of the 1 to minus the entropy S

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
So you could see that in this case

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
We know that in our example 1

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
Our entropy is 0.97

40:01.000 --> 40:08.000
So the ROC or POC will be 6.3 and 6.3 respectively

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
Okay

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
So then we know that the basic reward

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
And we know the reward of content

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And the punishment of content

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
And how we reflect to each appraiser

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
And we will calculate the ratio of SOA

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Which means that

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
For example, in SOA, we have the 0.66

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
And for A1, we will know that

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
There are 36% of the trust score

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
The score of authentic is come from

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Is come from the appraiser 1

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
So we will use this ratio to reflect

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
The reward to each appraiser

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And for the punishment is the same

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
We will know that

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
How you contribute to the trust of the fake

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
And then if you contribute

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Or you occupy more percentage

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
You will get more reward or more punishment

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
Okay

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
So in here, you can see

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
We calculate the ratio of ROC and the ratio of POC

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
Which each appraiser need to be reflected

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
It will be added or be reduced

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
And then when we reflect it

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
You can see that for, for example, in for A1

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
The initial, its initial state is 5,000

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
And after state is the 5,000 point 23

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
So we could get all the after states

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
And then we can calculate the after credit point

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
So this is a cycle

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
When every content, when we finish the appraising process

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
We will have the new states and the new credit point

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
And then they will get ready to accept another content

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
And if any appraiser

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
Their credit point is close to zero

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Which means that their stakes are heavy

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
They got a lot of the punishment

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
And their credit point

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Their stakes is equal to zero

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
And we will go back to our main flow

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
The initial process that to accept

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
To ask this appraiser

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Do you need to add more stakes

42:45.000 --> 42:51.000
To continue to be the appraiser

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
So that's how

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
So we only finish the

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
I think that the most difficult part in our presentation

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Is to calculate the trust score

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
And in this slide that we do some experiments

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
That to improve

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
To prove that our system could be a scale

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
On a lot of the users

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
You could see that

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
And in the left side

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
The picture shows that our system could

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
In our testing environment

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
We use the four servers

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
And the throughput is still goes well

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
But in our system

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
We set the contents

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
The maxima of the content is the eight megabytes

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Because you could imagine

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
If we compress the content

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
For videos or some

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
We use the in-camera size

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
There is the technique

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You could use the content to

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
As the input

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
And we have the output

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
It's a very short

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
Screen or some contents

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
And it will not to occupy a lot of size

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
So our limitation of the content

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Would be the eight megabytes

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
And the right-hand side

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
The picture shows that

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
We all know that the computer system

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Is rely on the fault tolerance

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Which means that

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
If the main server fails

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
Our systems should still work well

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
You could see that

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
For example, you put a Facebook

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
One server crashed down

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And you cannot use the Facebook

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
It's not good

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So this is the right-hand side

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
The picture shows that

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
If we make some server failure

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
Our system still could work well

44:46.000 --> 44:54.000
And the latency will not to increase very much

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
Okay, so I think we can get into conclusion

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
So yeah, so our system

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
I asked to summarize some take-home points

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
For all of you

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Yeah, as you remember that

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
I've said that the AI technique

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Is getting better and better

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
So the traditional algorithms

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
Does not get the great performance

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
To detect the fake news automatic

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
So if we use the human's capabilities

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
We will have a better solution

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
Than the traditional AI algorithms

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
But of course we could combine

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
The advantage for the AI algorithms

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And the human-based capability

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
For example, we can use AI technique

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
To build the first layer of filters

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
And people can get into

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
To check the results, right

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
But the most important part

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
Is the blockchain network

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Because it's decentralized

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
Not to manage it by only one companies

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
It's transparency

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
And very easier to find some data

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
It's being modified

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And so in this experience

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
We know that our system

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Is the architecture is peaceful

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
And we could

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
It has potential to be deployed

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
In thousands of machines

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
And the most important part

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
Is that our incentive mechanism

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Offers this architecture

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Commercial potential

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
You could imagine that to

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
If you are a writer

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Or you are a photographer

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
You could use our system

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
To get some proof

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
That your content is real

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
And your reputation

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Will getting better, right

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
And you are a journalist

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Or you are some

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
If people doing a fact checking

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
And you can get reward from our system

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
So there is also

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Then this will have

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Get some commercial proof

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And for building

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
This is the

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Fact News Precision Systems

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Okay

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
So that's for

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
It's a long presentation

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
So I'll stop here

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
And I'll tell you here

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
Is that this research is

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Supported by Ripple

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Is the World Wide

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Payment Protocol

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
And also by

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
National Science and Engineering

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Research Council of Canada

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Okay

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
And also thanks my mentor

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
To give me

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
A lot of suggestions

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
And help when I

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Study for and to

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
Find some research ideas

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Or some

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Know more people how to do well

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
In a PhD program

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
So I will introduce

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Her Facebook

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
And

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
She wrote a lot of great things

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
For all of you who wants to

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
Study for or you have some

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
If you are women

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
That is the best

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Facebook for you to check

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
So I put it here

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
And I want to thank

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Catherine to be my mentor

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
And give me more

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Help

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Okay, so

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
That's all the presentation

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
And if you have a question

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
You could ask me right now

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
Or after the presentation

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
You could also drop me a mail

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Or find me on

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Or also

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
We will discuss with you

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
More detail or any questions you have

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
Yeah, thank you so much

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
So yeah, actually

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
So before we start our Q&A session

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
Please turn on your microphones again

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
So let's thank

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
Jianzhi for the very interesting talk

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Thank you, thank you

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Okay, so

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Some of our attendees

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Would like to ask in Mandarin Chinese

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Probably, I guess

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
But, I mean, any kind of language

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
As long as you can communicate

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
That will all be fine

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
So, yeah

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I'm happy to ask questions

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Anyone?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Hello, hi

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I'm Shanna

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
And I would like to know

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Because I noticed that

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Actually you have no experience

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Studying abroad, right?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
This is your first time

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Yeah

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
How do you practice English?

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Sorry, it's not related to your content

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
But I'm just curious

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Oh, yeah, it's an interesting question

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
Is that I think

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I learned some English

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Speaking practicing courses in UW

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
So, yeah, they gave me a lot of practice

49:57.000 --> 50:04.000
To

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Try to join

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Reach some

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Course master

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
The class near UW

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
So there's a lot of chance for me

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Practicing English, yeah

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Is that answer your question?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Oh, yes

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
And I heard some people said

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
That we should prepare

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Maybe we should join the like

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
UHSL

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
It's faster than we prepare English fast

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
How do you think about that?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
If I cannot reach the score

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
That my school wants

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And did I need to apply for the language

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
UHSL first or

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
I just prepare English

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
And until I get a score

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Get a TOEFL, pass the TOEFL

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
And then apply for the language school

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Right

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I think this is

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Another interesting question

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Actually, I will suggest that

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
It depends if you

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
I will suggest to prepare English

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
And try your best to pass the TOEFL

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Or IELTS in Taiwan

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Because if you

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Go study abroad

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And you go to some language schools

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
The cost is really

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
It's very high

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
And then it will spend a lot of money

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
But the most important thing

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Is the but

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
If you

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Sometimes

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Some people are struggling

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
To pass the exams

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
So if you found that

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
You cannot concentrate to

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Prepare for the exam

51:45.000 --> 51:50.000
And you stuck on the TOEFL exam

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
And also the schools offer

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Some opportunities that

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
They say you could go to the university

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
To take the language courses

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
And then you can get over

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
I would say you just go

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
Because the time is important

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Do not to stuck one

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
One stage for a long time

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
I think that would be my answer

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Thank you, Tom

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
Yeah, so I have a question

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
So if we go back to your title

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I think you're saying that

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
This technique is mainly for

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
How do I say this

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
For deploying against fake news

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
But if you let the people decide

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
What will be the thing that they recognize

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
They basically just vote

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
Let's say Barack Obama just died

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
And if you let the internet vote

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Probably 99% of the people will say

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
That's a fake news

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
But let's say objectively true thing

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
That cannot be voted to become a truth

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
In your system

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
How do you comment about that

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Yeah, like I said

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
We trust the majority opinion

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
In our system

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
We have the reward and punishment mechanism

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
To make you to do the correct

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
And the honest things

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
Actually in all of the blockchain network

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
They have the specific incentive mechanism

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
To prevent from some malicious notes

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
So if you join our

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
We have two mechanism to prevent

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
This the notes to adjust to vote

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Actually they will do their best

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
Because the first if they join our system

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
They need to pay for pay fees for

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Like I said the stakes

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
So it's a cost

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
And then if we join system

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
And you did not do your job very well

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
You will get the punishment

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
And then eventually

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
You will be prohibited

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
To be the oppressors in our system

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
So our mechanism of incentive

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
Is core concept to incentive people

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
To check the content seriously

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
And to vote correctly

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
So if I understand correctly

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Basically the assumption

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
That you are going with

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
Is that people generally have good intention

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
And they are answering

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Based on their good intention

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Regardless of the truth

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
So say Obama just died

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Nobody knows

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
And they basically just like saying

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
It's not a good news

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Because it's just not the thing

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
That is well established that I know

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
But it's true

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
So in your system

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
It's basically working against

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Malicious information

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
But not exactly news

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
Can I say that

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
I could say how to define the bad news

55:16.000 --> 55:22.000
Is that the content should be correct

55:22.000 --> 55:28.000
So when you say Obama is dead

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
If it's not a truth

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
Our system will consider it is a bad news

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
But in my scenario

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
I'm saying what if he really just died

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
But nobody knows like 10 minutes ago

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
And I go out and say

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Hey guys, he just died

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
That will be a fake news in your system

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Because nobody knows

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
That's true

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Yeah, you're right

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
But if you say Obama is dead

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
But nobody knows

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
I would say that

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
This situation is really

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
It's extremely

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
That's quite a situation news

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Yeah, so I think

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Because those oppressing actors

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
Are very capable to check the contents

56:25.000 --> 56:32.000
So if they hesitate to give some opinions

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Their confidence will lower

56:34.000 --> 56:39.000
So the trust score of the agree

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Authentic and the fact

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
They will be very similar

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
So our system will not treat it

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
In your case as a very tend to be real

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Or fake, it will be a bad news

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
But we could give you an objective opinion

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
To check this content

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I see

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Okay

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
I do have some comment about the previous question

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Just like

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Okay

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Okay, first, thank you for a nice talk

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
And for the tokenomics design

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
I think that's about how you make a dispute system

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Because for now it's like a one-time votes

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And you just get the result done

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
But if you see like

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
In order for the prediction market

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Just like if you predict

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
And like whether Obama will die between like 2021

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
And people at 2021 votes

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Maybe 3% of the voters enough to get yes or no

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
But if you don't trust the result

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
You can put your stake against that voting result

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
And then more people need to vote

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
If you stake like maybe 1% of the total token

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Then all of the people need to vote

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
So I guess you need to kind of like refine

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
The appeal system or the tokenomics

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
Because I think the previous question is quite valid

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
Because you assume that like the majority vote

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Will know the truth

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
But maybe it takes some time right

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
So but if you like you want to label the news in 10 minutes

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
And definitely well it's hard to get information

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
To propagate to like the society or the civilization

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
To get people votes and get the correct result

58:35.000 --> 58:40.000
So I guess you just need to have a dispute system

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
I guess

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Yeah, sure

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
But like you said

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Yeah

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
If you want to get news in just 10 minutes

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
To see if it's correct or not

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
It will be difficult to achieve that

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Because maybe like Elon said

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
The news is not just known by minority people

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
But yeah, for this case

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
I think for previous the current solutions

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
I think people will have

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Like we have put more stakes

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
Or we can to introduce more

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
The sub-parties, the libraries

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
And we can ask their opinions

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
So our speed will get in faster

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
Yeah, well I do think this is a very interesting

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Actually very valuable research

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I'm just being curious

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
Yeah, so anyone has other questions

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
I have some questions

59:52.000 --> 59:59.000
Do you really plan to launch this thing in a public chain

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Because I was saying the past like two years

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Hyperledger is not like really striving

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And even though like the gas fee

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And the transaction fee is an issue

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
For like Bitcoin in Syria

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
But for the new generation

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Like high throughput blockchain

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Also support smart contract

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Then it will be a much better platform

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I would say

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Because well Hyperledger is definitely more

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Like clean and more permission

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But how to really scale the platform

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I would say like public chain is still better

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Than the permission chain

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah, actually you are right

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We plan to introduce some

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Digital tokens in our system

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Because we need to get the reward or punishment

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So Ethereum will be the one choice

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
That we consider to transfer

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
The Hyperledger to the Ethereum

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And also there are other tokens

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
That invented right now

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
They have a great

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Because the Ethereum and Bitcoin

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Their speed is too slow

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But there are lots of faster blockchain network

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So we consider to
