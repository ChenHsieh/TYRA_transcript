1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
哇,现在应该已经看到荧幕了,我开始录影了,我看得到,我看得到。

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
2011年,我参加了几个研究,在2014年,我参加了Citrine的研究室。

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:58,000
主要,我们专注于两种光学,两种光学现象,基本上是非线光和数字光。

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:12,000
我的讲座已经安排好了,我首先介绍一下我们关于这个研究和我们为什么要做这个研究的原因。

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
接下来,我将进行两个设置。

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:31,000
一种是半导弹雷射,我将介绍设置和我们在过去两年工作的一个应用。

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:44,000
接下来,我将谈论一颗光源发射器,因为我们现在能够一颗光源发射。

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
我们将谈论,当我们在镜子前放置一颗光源发射器时,

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
我们希望观察到一些复杂或复杂的现象。

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
我先开始非常基本的讨论。

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
这是最基本的评论系统。

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
它非常普遍地使用在机械工程上,

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
当人们研究控制理论时,

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
他们将放置一颗光源发射器在任何地方前,

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
然后使用量化效果来返回系统中,

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
观察他们所观察到的现象。

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
大部分的人都想控制它们,

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
这在控制理论上是一个很大的问题,

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
当他们尝试研究这些动态系统时。

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
我尝试减少我们所有的数量计算,

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
这是最简单的计算,

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
这是动态计算。

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
动态计算,

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
而不是原来的实验室计算,

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
可能是因为我们有回复,

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
所以我们会有延迟时间,

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
我们会有回复的力量,

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
或者其他东西,

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
包括在动态计算的研究中。

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
所以这些可能是在使用光源,

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
在这些图片中,

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
我展示了两个不同的设置,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
一个在左侧,

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
是一个内存光源路径,

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
一个内存光源路径,

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
内存在这些小的光源或光源元件中。

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
基本上,

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
它们会在强烈的波浪中生成数据,

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
我会在更详细的地方讨论,

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
但是它是一个研究系统,

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
人们可以使用它来生成氧气,

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
或其他氧气源。

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
所以右侧的那个,

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
是一个非常相似的设置,

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
如果你想象一下,

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
半导弹,

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
一颗导弹,

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
现在被替换成了一颗光源,

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
如果有人知道雷射,

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
你可以想象,

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
它是一个洞,

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
它有一个光源在洞内,

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
它会产生光,

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
当洞内有同样的波浪长度时,

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
它们会有波浪长度,

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
或许我们无法控制它,

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
至少我们会看到很有趣的动态。

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
我开始用半导弹作为评论,

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
这个系统,

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
我们通常称之为外部洞穴半导弹雷射,

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
系统显示在右侧,

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
我们有一个DFB雷射,

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
我们把雷射放在镜子前面,

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
我们发现了一个简单的,

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
但我认为还蛮聪明的方法,

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
来控制这些回复力量,

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
回复进入雷射,

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
然后我们可以用高速摄像头来测量强度,

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
在做这些,

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
我们还在测量强度的波浪,

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
在这里我们可以看到外部洞穴的长度,

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
这是我们研究中的另一个关键因素,

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
两倍的长度,

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
分割为c,

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
是延迟时间,

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
我们之后会讨论这个,

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
在演示中。

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
这是一个理论,

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
描述外部洞穴半导弹雷射,

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
这是由兰和科巴亚设计的,

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
这两个人,

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
我们描述了系统的三个特征,

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
我们有电流,

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
我们有视觉屏幕,

85
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
当回复灯光进入半导弹时,

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
我们有车辆数据,

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
我之前介绍过的电流计算,

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
在这个系统中,

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
基本上,

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
我们用这个模型,

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
我们有三种动力计算,

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
描述了三个特征,

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
一般来说,

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
当人们学习非近距离动力时,

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
人们会学习,

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
行为在平均点附近,

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
或者在近距离,

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
是的,

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
在我们的情况下,

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
这叫做外部洞穴模型,

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
基本上,

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
当你把这三种计算设定为0,

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
你就能够解决一系列的解决方案,

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
它们是稳定的,

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
或者只是平均点,

106
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
它们是0的,

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
所以,

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
如我所说的,

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
我们有外部洞穴频率,

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
这与延迟时间有关,

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
我们有放松挥动频率,

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
这与延迟时间有关,

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
是的,

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
我们可以继续,

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
在第一步中,

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
我们所要求的最有趣的一件事,

117
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
就是要找到比例图,

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
比例图是,

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
当我们改变一个比例图,

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
在增加或减少时,

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
我们会看到这些比例图的动态变化,

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
两个比例图下面,

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
这些显示了这些比例图的严重性作用,

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
这些比例图可能是,

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
如我所说的,

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
这些比例图的严重性作用,

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
或者您可以改变外部洞穴频率,

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
或者您可以改变驾驶流量,

129
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
我们看到这些比例图,

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
它们开始非常简单,

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
我们通常称之为继续波,

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
基本上我们有镭射,

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
但是它可能增加或减少一点点光,

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
然后我们有跳动,

135
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
然后我们增加到,

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
我们有这些比例图,

137
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
所以这两个比例图,

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
显示了有两种稳定的解决方案,

139
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
所以在强度方面,

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
我们通常会看到 periodic 阶段,

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
基本上我们有一个磁波,

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
然后下一步,

143
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
我们会进入两个其他树枝,

144
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
这时候我们通常会看到 quasi-periodic,

145
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
接下来我们会看到 chaotic 强度,

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
这通常是一个很大的模糊,

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
或者是一个非常随机的东西,

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
这就是我们使用它

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
为了几个阶段的数据。

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
所以,如同我们在前面的项目中谈到的,

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
我们现在有一个非常好的研究模式,

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
对于半導體雷射,

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
但如同大部分人所知,

154
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
雷射只是一堆博物馆,

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
儘管我們可以形容這個模式

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
在電子領域和載體數目中是最差的,

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
但當我們在同一時間生產一個博物馆時,

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
我們通常會看到不同的行為,

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
從半導體雷射到單焦鏡,

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
這是我研究的第二部分,

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
而我右邊展示的是單焦鏡,

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
我們有幾層鏡子,

163
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
他們稱之為白光反射器,

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
它們只是鏡子,

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
我們有一個雷射點,

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
固定在這片堡壘的中間,

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
然後我們有雷射燈,

168
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
它們都固定在三個方向,

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
我們可以稍微控制雷射頻率,

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
但不太多,

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
我們可以控制,

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
我們想要快速啟動或啟動雷射點,

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
然後得到一個很好的雷射,

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
一個雷射燈,

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
我首先開始,

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
我會介紹一些我對半導體雷射的結果,

177
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
我會先描述原理,

178
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
然後我會討論一個,

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
只有一個我們有的應用,

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
叫做電子雷射器,

181
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
這基本上是我們的實驗設置,

182
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
雷射燈在右邊,

183
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
我們可以同時測量雷射頻率和強度,

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
這是很有趣的,

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
但在過去10-20年,

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
雷射並沒有被研究,

187
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
人們通常集中在雷射頻率,

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
雷射頻率,

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
但是我們只有拿到電子雷射,

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
所以沒有大改變,

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
雷射的方向沒有大改變,

192
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
只有雷射輻射在這邊被觀察,

193
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
我們所改變的 parameters 是 feedback strength,

194
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
如同我們所見,

195
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
當我們增強了 feedback strength,

196
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
我們會從雷射開始,

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
基本上只是雷射輻射,

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
然後我們會有一個雷射輻射,

199
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
然後進入雷射輻射,

200
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
接著我們會有一個雷射輻射,

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
所以我們同時可以測試雷射輻射,

202
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
我們看到雷射輻射中,

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
雷射輻射只有一個光學頻率,

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
也就是說雷射輻射非常穩定,

205
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
雷射輻射只有一個光學頻率,

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
接著我們會有一個超時空輻射,

207
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
在超時空輻射中,

208
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
雷射輻射會發動多於一個外部空氣輻射,

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
然後我們會進入一個時空輻射,

210
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
當我們看到時空輻射,

211
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
時空輻射會分成

212
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
放鬆和振奮的頻率,

213
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
放鬆和振奮的頻率,

214
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
我可能還沒有提到,

215
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
是基於不同的半導體雷射,

216
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
是基於不同的半導體雷射,

217
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
將同時提升雷射頻率,

218
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
將同時提升雷射頻率,

219
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
以及你正在應用的電流,

220
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
最後我們提高了回復力,

221
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
最後我們提高了回復力,

222
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
我們進入一個混亂的區域,

223
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
當所有的外部模式都在興奮,

224
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
然後在後面時,

225
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
我們會有另一張片段

226
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
描述如何混亂的區域。

227
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
所以我準備了一個非常短的

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:35,000

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:58,000
所以我準備了一個非常短的

230
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:12,000
所以我準備了一個非常短的

231
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
我剛剛講的就是從CW到

232
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
我剛剛講的就是從CW到

233
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Quasi-periodic到Periodic,

234
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Quasi-periodic到Periodic,

235
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
然後還有一些各種不同的

236
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
然後還有一些各種不同的

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000

239
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
然後,
