1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
那麼在大學

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
嗯?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
喔開始錄影了

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
好然後呢

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
在這個

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
大學畢業之後呢

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
呃

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
泳怡應該是在

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
有做RA吧我沒有記錯的話

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
在陳其中老師那裡對不對

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
嗯

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
對然後做了一兩年

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
兩年一年一年吧一兩年

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
之後呢

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
就是到這個

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
加拿大的medmaster念

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
呃博士班齁

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
那麼在念這個

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
博士班的時候他的指導

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有一個指導老師是那個Dr.Trenner

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
然後做的是呃關於

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
呃音樂的認知

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
還有知覺的心理歷程

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
這樣子

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
那呃等一下大家可以再問他一下

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
如果有興趣的話問他一下

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
為什麼會選擇做這個

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
音樂

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
就是說是聽覺的

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
知覺與認知因為其實我自己個人的

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
理解我自己不是念知覺

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
不清楚啦齁但是我的

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
impression是其實做視覺的

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
是佔了很大在

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
知覺心理學佔了很大的部分那為什麼會決定要

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
做聽覺呢這我自己是覺得很有趣

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
好那麼

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
蛤我不知道

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
這是我的猜測我有一些猜測嘛對不對

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
然後好然後泳怡有一個

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
網站齁大家可以進去點很恐怖喔

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
很恐怖然後那個

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
publication藏得跟鬼一樣

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
然後除了

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
publication之外還有一些就是

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
award啊還有media coverage

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
這我覺得最厲害了希望有一天

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
我也可以跟爸媽說我是張信文

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
好那廢話

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
不多說就請泳怡

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
今天跟我們分享他的

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
研究

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
那我把我麥克風關掉你們有回應喔

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
好呃

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
大家會有回應嗎

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
應該還好

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
自介我都聽了害羞

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
今天我都不知道演講

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
還要打分今天7月8號

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
我猜我最高就87分不能再高了

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
大概就是這樣

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
可以預測到結果

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
那

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
就是要開audio才能笑聲你才會聽到

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
我覺得沒有笑聲的feedback

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
有點落寞

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
好像需要feedback齁

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
蠻好笑蠻好笑

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
蠻好笑蠻好笑被鼓勵了

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
喔不愧是念正向心理學的人

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
就是不一樣

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
好

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
應該虛聲一片了

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
那我是

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
我對聽覺有興趣其實

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
沒有那麼

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
深刻的理由啦就是

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
第一個我自己對音樂很有興趣

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
那我也是後來才知道

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
原來大部分人都做視覺

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
然後大部分人講知覺其實

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
imply就是視覺

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
我是之後才知道

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
就是如果你發paper如果你是做聽覺

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
你還要說是特別註明是auditory

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
不然人家會搞錯

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
還蠻有趣的啦

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
不過anyway我覺得聽覺是有一些

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
現象是

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
其他的知覺的

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
情況下是比較不一樣

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
有一些特殊的

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
特殊的問題要去處理的

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
這也是我覺得聽覺比較有趣

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
比較特殊的一個地方

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
好那我就來進入我的演講

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
我要開始

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
研究一下怎麼share我的螢幕

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
在你研究的時候我先跟大家講一下

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
就是呢

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
為了怕說會有feedback的問題

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
所以可能大家

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
關一下麥克風不過如果大家中間有一些

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
什麼想要發表的啊

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
都可以用打字的

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
其實也可以用講的啦

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
應該也還好

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
好

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
來吧

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
好那

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
就我的題目

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
整個PhD的研究主題是

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
很模糊的字

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
就是Dynamic Auditory Communication

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
顧名思義

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
就是說如何在動態的情況下

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
動態是指隨時間而改變的

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
聽覺

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
如何進行隨時間而改變的

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
聽覺的

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
communication

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
那其實這個就包含譬如說

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
像是你們現在聽我講話

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
那所有的聲音也都是隨時間而變的

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
比如說我的每個聲音就是出現那一毫秒

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
然後之後就消失了

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
或者是聽音樂也算是

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
這樣的一個情況

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
然後呢而且我今天是想要特別分享的是

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
我的實驗

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
從一般傳統的小實驗室

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
心理學的小實驗室

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
然後做一做就做到

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
比較複雜的我們認為

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
比較接近真實的

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
人類互動的環境

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
底下做

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
那從小實驗室到大的實驗室

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
它彼此之間其實有

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
研究方法上有一些

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
需要調整的地方

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
然後我今天就是想要說明

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
我們是怎麼

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
以我們的研究為例子就是說

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
我們是怎麼樣做這件事情

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
所以我的副標題就是說心理學家

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
如何做研究而且是有

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
分解步驟的說明

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
每一個遇到的問題是什麼

150
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
然後以及就是說我們認為

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
在我們的情況下我們是怎麼解決的

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
然後就是順便

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
就是麻煩

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
大家幫忙一下的地方就是說

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
就是九月的

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
台灣的科學月刊會有一個

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
音樂心理學的

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
一個特別的特刊

159
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
然後就是

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
我想要把這個

161
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
相關的研究就是

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
投稿到那邊當成一個

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
小的主題

164
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
就是當作科普的

165
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
分享給台灣的讀者

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
我自己是沒有寫

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
做過科普文章的經驗

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
我希望就是說

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
我希望就是把今天的演講

170
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
弄成不同的領域

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
對科學有興趣的人都可以大概一窺

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
心理學家我們怎麼做研究

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
特別是在我們這麼特別的情況下

174
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
怎麼做研究的那如果大家覺得

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
內容上或是講解的方法上

176
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
有怎麼樣可以調整得更好

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
希望大家可以跟我講

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
然後

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
我會兩個禮拜之後就要接考了

180
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
所以非常感謝

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
如果有任何的幫忙的話

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
OK

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
廢話應該都結束了

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
首先我要講的就是說

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
聽覺有很多的Domain

186
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
像是比如說我們可以知道音的高或低

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
那我今天要主要的是

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
聚焦在時間對聽覺

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
是很重要的事情

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
其實時間對很多的知覺

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
還有反應都是非常重要的

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
對於聽覺我覺得是

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
尤其關鍵

194
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
為什麼呢如果你把我的聲音錄下來

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
然後再拿到電腦的軟體

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
裡面去打開去看他的播文

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
他的播文會長得像

198
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
差不多像這樣子

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
那你當然可以decode就是說

200
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
每一小段的播文是對應到我的什麼語音

201
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
然後

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
我們的聽覺就是我們要把它

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
組合起來才會變成一個有意義的句子

204
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
那可是對聽覺很難

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
就是說每一個訊息

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
出現的時間就是那麼的短

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
而且

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
就是不會再出現

209
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
人類活了這麼久的歷史

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
人跟人交談的歷史

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
到錄音機發明之前我們都沒有任何的機會

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
再去聽到

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
之前發生過的事情是怎麼樣

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
所以說人類聽覺一個很大的問題

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
就是說我們必須要

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
能夠迅速的抓到

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
隨時間展開的這個訊息

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
並且準確的知覺到

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
準確的感受到它這個的內容

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
然後而且另外一個

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
更demanding的是

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
就是我們不只是知覺到這件事情

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
而且我們必須要迅速的做出反應

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
就比如說你跟別人有

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
對話的時候你聽到別人在講什麼

226
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
你馬上就要能夠理解

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
然後馬上能夠產生反應

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
那這個技巧在吵架的時候就特別重要

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
因為如果你慢了一拍你吵架就輸了

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
就非常的演化就很重要

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
對不對

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
所以你看人類就是這樣子吵過來

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
那不只是在對話

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
那在另外的情況下

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
比如說你在聽音樂

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
而且比如說你跟人家一起唱歌

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
合唱好了

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
那我不可能

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
就是聽到人家的音樂

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
聽到這一拍我才要準備去

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
把我的這一拍唱出來

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
因為你這樣子不論你的處理速度有多快

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
一定會有個時間差在裡面

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
那

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
所以其實聽覺很多的情況下

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
我們認為是

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
他一直不斷的不斷的在預測

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
接下來會發生什麼事情

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
然後讓人

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
一直讓你的知覺

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
讓你的神經反應一直處在一個

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
準備好的情況下

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
然後你才能夠準確的知覺到這件事情

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
然後以及快速的

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
準備好去做出接下來要做的反應

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
所以我覺得聽覺在

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
時間上面

258
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
其實是比其他的sensory domain

259
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
是更加的demanding

260
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
這是我認為

261
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
其實很重要的

262
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
那如果大家有任何問題

263
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
中間都可以打斷我

264
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
那如果沒有問題我就繼續下去

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
然後by the way

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
因為我現在的

267
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
我分享screen的關係

268
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
所以如果大家在chat那邊留言的話

269
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
我應該現在是看不到的

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
所以大家可以直接把麥克風打開

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
跟我講沒有關係

272
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
我有一個問題

273
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
請說請說

274
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
就那個

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
MING

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
那是什麼

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
那只是我網路上抓的例子而已

278
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
我也不知道那是什麼東西

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
不好意思

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
ok

281
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
那應該是一個project的title

282
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
對

283
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
看起來是這樣子

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
可是我也沒search過

285
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
可能是做什麼語音

286
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
電腦的語音

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
處理的一些project

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
那我先講一下

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
在傳統的心理學和神經科學

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
我們如何在實驗室做

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
這類的研究

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
如果我們想知道時間對聽覺的重要性是什麼

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
我們會怎麼做研究

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
那譬如說我會

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
用電腦去設計一個聽覺的

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
一個序列

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
一個隨時間展開的聽覺的序列

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
然後譬如說我可以

300
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
一種聲音檔

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
每一個聲音

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
都是時間

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
每一個tone之間

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
它的時間都是固定的一樣的長度

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
就譬如說500ms

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
所以這樣子你就

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
聽起來就像節拍器一樣

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
然後可以一直延續下去

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
所以這個是時間很規律的情況

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
那你可以有一種

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
時間不規律的情況

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
就譬如說就是

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
你的tone跟tone之間

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
就是350ms到750ms之間

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
所以可能聽起來就像

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
就是你完全不會知道

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
什麼時候下一個tone會出現

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
然後呢

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
在這樣的不同的情境底下

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
我們可以

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
要求受試者去做一些

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
知覺的回答

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
就譬如說我們可以讓

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
其中的有一些音

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
就是這些音大部分都是一模一樣的音高

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
那有一些音

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
我們就讓它變成是一點點高音

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
或一點點低音

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
我們在frequency domain上去做一些調整

330
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
然後受試者就

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
來參與實驗的大學生

332
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
就要聽那個聲音

333
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
如果他聽到音比較高他就要按一個鍵

334
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
如果聽到一個音比較低就按一個鍵

335
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
就聽起來像是

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
B

337
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
你就要去

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
聽到高音低音就要做反應

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
然後另外就時間不規律的情況下

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
你也可以做這樣的操弄

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
你可以去看比如說

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
時間規律的情況下

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
它答對的正確率就會比較高

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
比起時間不規律的情況下

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
那我們就可以

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
心理學家通常就會說

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
那就是時間的規律可以幫助你

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
有更好的知覺

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
因為你會比較好

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
因為你的正確率比較高

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
你可以有比較正確的回答

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
那在這樣的同時的情況下

353
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
我們也可以做一些神經科學的量測

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
譬如說

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
量測人的腦電波

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
這是一個示意圖

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
因為大腦的神經反應

358
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
大腦的神經反應也都是用

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
電生理訊號的方式做反應

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
那我們可以把那些

361
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
比如說量測心電圖或量測肌肉電位的

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
那些sensor我們就把它放到頭皮上

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
那因為神經反應

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
電波訊號會散出來

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
所以我們可以在頭皮表面上

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
去把這個訊號錄起來

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
那就是變成我們說腦電波的

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
訊號

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
那我們可以做一些相應的分析

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
我們可以看就是說腦電波是怎麼樣

371
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
去抓住這個時間的規律性

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
然後譬如說

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
我們做一些複雜的處理

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
然後我們會得到差不多像這樣的

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
答案就是說我們會發現

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
譬如說腦波它就會

377
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
把它的震盪的速度

378
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
調整的跟外在的刺激震盪的

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
速度一樣

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
然後這樣子我們只要抓住這個腦中

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
想像腦裡面神經就像一個節拍器一樣

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
它就能夠準確的抓住下一秒

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
時間怎麼產生的

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
那這是傳統神經科學上

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
或是心理學上我們會做

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
這樣子取向的一個研究

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
那可是這個研究其實

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
可以問一下嗎?

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
請說請說

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
就是你那個時間點就是它的頻率

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
那個週期

392
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
最短可以到多少

393
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
你是說

394
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
我聲音的週期還是腦波的週期

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
聲音的週期

396
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
然後再來就是

397
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
如果腦波你要去調整到

398
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
跟你外界的是一樣的話

399
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
它有沒有一個limit在

400
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
這是好問題

401
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
通常人類能夠抓住到的

402
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
節拍最短

403
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
就是tone跟tone之間

404
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
最短是200ms

405
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
我沒辦法唱那麼快

406
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
大概就是他們那樣的速度

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
超過200ms

408
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
你大概就會覺得它幾乎是一個連續的音

409
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
那最慢

410
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
就是tone跟tone之間最長

411
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
可以長到大概

412
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
1200ms

413
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
1.2秒

414
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
那超過那個之後你就會覺得

415
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
每個音都是獨立的

416
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
你不會覺得它是一個連續的節奏

417
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
就是你沒有辦法知道它這個規律

418
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
那很有趣的是說

419
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
腦波大概也就是

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
只能夠追到這樣的一個速度的range

421
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
它超過比這個慢

422
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
或比這個快

423
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
都沒有辦法

424
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
那至於那是什麼造成什麼

425
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
這個我不曉得

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
就說是因為腦波沒辦法動那麼快動那麼慢

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
才造成我們知覺上沒辦法追到這麼快這麼慢的速度

428
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
這我不曉得

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
我只能說

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
現在我們測到的是像這樣子

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
謝謝

432
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
哈囉

433
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
哈囉

434
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
所以想請問一下

435
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
你們做這個實驗的時候

436
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
是必須要屏除其他那種聲音的干擾嗎

437
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
沒錯

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
我們做這種實驗

439
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
因為為了求乾淨

440
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
所以我們都會在防音室裡面做

441
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
然後我們會用耳機

442
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
就是會用那種比較特殊的耳機

443
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
直接把聲音就是送到

444
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
耳洞裡面去

445
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
而且是很靠近

446
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
就是越裡面越好

447
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
就是非常乾淨的

448
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
就是希望減低外在的干擾

449
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
沒錯

450
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
那你們說所謂的聽覺的時候指的是

451
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
就是人類

452
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
就是我們真的可以

453
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
就是聽到的聲音還是包含那種

454
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
包含那種就是我們聽不到的頻率

455
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
也都算在聽覺裡面

456
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
譬如說超音波

457
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
或者頻率非常低的那種

458
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
那種也算聽覺

459
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
那種

460
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
那種就是你在問就是說

461
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
物理刺激有沒有心理感受

462
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
就是我們的話

463
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
會這樣子問問題

464
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
當然也有人研究

465
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
這樣的問題

466
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
就是說人類聽覺極限在哪裡

467
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
那你可以看頻率極限在哪裡

468
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
不過這個不是我今天

469
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
就是主要討論的部分

470
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
我們或許

471
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
等一下再

472
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
有多的時間再討論

473
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
這樣子

474
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
還是就是直接隨便討論都可以

475
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
不是不是

476
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
我比較好奇的是當你說

477
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
你要摒除那個干擾

478
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
雜音干擾的時候

479
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
就是你怎麼摒除那種

480
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
就是我們根本不知道我們聽到的那種

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
干擾

482
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
譬如說像超音波

483
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
那個叫什麼

484
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
就是完全沒有噪音的那種干擾的那種

485
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
實驗環境下你也沒辦法保證說

486
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
他不會接受到外界的

487
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
雜訊

488
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
OKOK那我知道了

489
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
就是當然

490
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
我們做法的話

491
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
通常都是我們已經知道人類的

492
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
聽覺的frequency range

493
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
大概就是20Hz到20000Hz

494
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
那在這個Hz的frequency range裡面

495
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
我們

496
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
其實都實驗的環境下都還測得到

497
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
那測得到的情況下

498
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
我們就會這樣一頻出

499
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
那至於超聲波的話

500
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
我們是一般認為是人類

501
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
生理上其實就是聽不到啦

502
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
那所以

503
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
他的控制就不會太廣

504
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
所以就是說譬如說

505
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
有實驗室裡面電燈泡

506
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
那個閃爍的那個聲音

507
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
或是那種非常非常高頻的

508
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
我們就不管了

509
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
所以就是基於一個假設說

510
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
那些東西就是不會造成

511
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
對人類不會造成太大的干擾

512
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
對真的不會太大的干擾

513
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
另外就是說像我們做實驗的情況

514
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
我們並不會說

515
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
一個condition就只做一個trial

516
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
我們當然會做幾百個trial

517
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
所以就算有影響

518
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
只要他是跟你實驗的電腦

519
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
設定的program是沒有

520
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
彼此相關的話

521
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
那我們觀察到的效果

522
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
應該這些外在的

523
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
影響應該就是會被減低很多

524
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
OK好謝謝

525
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
然後

526
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
插話一下就是說

527
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
這個Pub的流程呢

528
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
怎麼樣的話永宇你當然可以自己決定

529
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
看你想要

530
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
就是說要中間接受問題

531
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
還是最後一起問

532
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
還是直接開放討論都可以你決定

533
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
然後不過就是我們

534
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
預設的話是

535
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
你可以自己可以講差不多一個小時

536
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
然後後面呢

537
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
大概可以有個20分鐘的討論

538
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
這樣子

539
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
那至於你要

540
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
切成兩半還是混在一起還是怎麼樣

541
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
你就自己決定就好

542
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
OK好

543
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
我先跟大家講一下

544
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
其實PubPoint沒有準備很多啊

545
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
那所以

546
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
主題的部分一下就會講完了

547
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
如果

548
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
有一些相關的跟主題

549
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
當然對不起剛剛那個我只是沒有

550
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
不知道你的問題是什麼

551
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
如果是跟聽覺或是其他音樂相關的

552
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
我們可以等到那個時候再討論

553
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
那如果跟這個我在講的主題有關的話

554
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
當然我們就提出來就現場討論

555
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
對不起我只是剛剛沒有不曉得你這個問題

556
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
跟這個

557
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
這個我現在講的東西關聯在哪裡

558
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
OK

559
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
好那

560
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
可是OK

561
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
那我就繼續往下好了

562
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
那我覺得做實驗室研究

563
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
最大的問題就是說如果我們

564
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
想要了解是人跟人之間

565
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
怎麼樣正常的用譬如說用聽覺訊息

566
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
互動可是其實時間規律

567
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
跟時間不規律這兩種訊息

568
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
我這種實驗我製造電腦

569
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
裡面製造這種訊息根本在自然間

570
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
中是不存在的你自然間中你不會

571
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
聽到一個像是節拍器一樣這麼準確

572
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
的訊息你也不會聽到一個就是

573
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
完全random的一個訊息你通常

574
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
都會聽到有一點規律可是又

575
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
沒有那麼規律的訊息

576
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
那如果我這樣子做研究我到底

577
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
對於了解我人類真實

578
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
的能力又有什麼幫助

579
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
其實是有些時候是有點偏離的

580
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
所以

581
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
其實有一篇paper很有趣

582
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
最近才發表的他叫做

583
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
neuroscience needs behavior

584
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
如果你對相關的

585
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
哲學科學哲學的問題有

586
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
有興趣的話我非常推薦這篇paper

587
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
那我現在先用他裡面的

588
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
幾張圖來講我要講的

589
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
這個研究實驗室研究的局限

590
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
就一般我們想要知道研究可以就是說

591
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
比如說人腦的神經的

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
神經的pattern

593
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
跟自然的行為之間的

594
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
關係是什麼那你可以把

595
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
神經的pattern當成是

596
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
比如說心力歷程心路歷程

597
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
心理內在歷程也都可以

598
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
這是我們想要知道的

599
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
那一個比較設計好的理想實驗

600
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
就是說我們可以去控制

601
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
我們知道哪一部分的

602
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
心理歷程或是神經反應

603
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
對應到外在我們自然的

604
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
一些行為我們可以有一對

605
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
就是一對一的對應

606
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
或是比較簡單的對應

607
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
那可是像是我們剛剛那種實驗

608
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
其實剛剛那種實驗就是我其他

609
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
做的實驗我自己做的

610
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
我們我其實設計了

611
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
一個實驗的情況是

612
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
人類根本在一般情況下根本

613
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
就不會遇到的情況

614
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
然後我們在研究他的神經

615
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
反應雖然我們可以知道

616
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
這之間的關係可是並

617
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
不能夠直接回答人類在

618
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
自然的情況下是怎麼樣

619
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
我們沒辦法回答人類自然的

620
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
情況下的反應

621
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
我們知道是一些人類超智

622
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
超普通的能力就是超越

623
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
他平常的能力可是

624
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
我們對主要的研究課題其實

625
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
並沒有直接的了解這是我覺得

626
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
實驗室研究一些很大的局限

627
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
那尤其像是在其他的

628
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
一些領域有這樣的情況就比如說

629
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
如果你要操弄社會互動

630
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
你在很小的實驗室基本上

631
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
沒辦法做到這件事因為我們實驗室

632
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
基本上長得像這樣子就是

633
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
一個人坐在一個小小的隔音間

634
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
因為我們必須要像是

635
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
剛剛講的必須要控制掉所有的

636
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
外來刺激所以

637
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
通常就是一個人坐在裡面很安靜的

638
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
情況下自己跟電腦互動

639
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
然後而且同時因為

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
我們的量測工具

641
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
的關係就是比如說那個

642
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
那個測腦電波的

643
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
那個線的常作關係

644
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
他就只能坐在那邊他什麼事都不能做

645
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
他只能用兩隻手指頭做反應

646
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
所以其實這個也是

647
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
非常不自然的情況那這是一些

648
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
傳統實驗室環境

649
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
給予的一些限制

650
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
OK那到這邊

651
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
大家都同意其實蠻多限制的吧

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
那我要講的是說那我們

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
在我們實驗室的情況下

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
我們怎麼樣去設法去

655
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
延伸去解決這樣的

656
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
一個障礙

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
我現在要講的是

658
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
音樂可以是一個好的研究工具

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
他可以是一個

660
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
研究工具當成是

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
來幫助研究人類的

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
心智活動還有神經反應

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
他

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
有一些很好的方式

665
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
就比如說我可以保持有

666
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
很好的實驗操控的情況

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
就比如說我今天

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
按最左邊的這個A圖

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
我可以要受試者要一個人

670
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
進來然後我就給他一個節拍器

671
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
我就要求他

672
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
按鋼琴的按鍵然後按

673
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
的速度完全跟節拍器一模一樣

674
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
那這就是一個很好的控制的

675
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
一個實驗然後呢我可以

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
把這個我控制的條件越來越放

677
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
鬆就比如說我可以要

678
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
電腦產生一個節拍器可是這個

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
節拍器是隨著你按按鍵

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
的速度然後他會去

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
跟著你的速度去改變他自己的

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
節奏啊或者是說你可以

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
讓兩個人一起演奏

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
多人演奏甚至是多人演奏的

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
情況下你還有觀眾在同時

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
聽那

687
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
越來越往光譜的右側移動

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
那就是我們所說的

689
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Ecological

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Validity就是說你研究

691
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
的東西是能夠

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
對應到人類的真實的生活

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
的情況下那越右側

694
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
就是覺得我們覺得跟真實生活

695
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
越像因為通常演奏音樂的時候

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
會有觀眾在聽嗎這是可以理解的

697
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
那可是在光譜的右側其實

698
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
你的時間控制就會變得越來越差

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
就比如說一群人演奏音樂的時候

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
如果他們一起決定要

701
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
加速減速那你要怎麼

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
這都不是你實驗者可以事先

703
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
決定的事情那你

704
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
最後得到的資料那你在解釋

705
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
上就會變得很困難那

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
音樂可以是個好工具

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
就是因為他可以在這

708
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
中間取得某種平衡

709
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
就比如說他們兩人在互動

710
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
的時候他們不一定就是隨機

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
彈出彈奏他們想要的音樂

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
我可以給他樂譜

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
要求他們按著樂譜彈

714
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
而且如果他們有按著樂譜彈

715
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
的話如果他們彈錯什麼音其實

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
我們可以從事後的錄音去發現

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
這件事情所以我們可以

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
知道他做錯了什麼我也知道

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
正確答案是什麼而且我們可以設定

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
就是說他要演奏的節奏是什麼

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
所以我們還是有給一些

722
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
控制可是就算在給定這些條件

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
底下他們所進行的活動

724
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
仍然是非常的接近人類

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
真實行為的一個活動

726
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
我們認為音樂可以是一個很好的工具

727
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
去研究人類的

728
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
互動聽覺的communication

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
而且是可以平衡

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
就是實驗控制以及

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
生態效度這兩大的

732
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
問題

733
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
音樂另一個好處是說

734
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
你說音樂

735
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
是一個好的研究工具理由是

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
聽起來是因為他

737
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
可以被就是他可以有

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
從experimental control到

739
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
ecological interaction

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
整個光譜可是那你覺得

741
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
什麼研究工具沒有這樣子的特性呢

742
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
嗯

743
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
就比如說

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
語言難道沒有

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
這樣嗎就語言你是不是也可以

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
語言也有啊

747
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
對啊所以我覺得我不是很懂就是他為什麼是一個特別

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
好的研究工具我沒有說他特別好

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
我說他可以是個好的研究工具

750
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
ok好

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
所以我有理解出嗎就你的意思

752
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
是說他可以spam整個光譜

753
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
對他可以是個

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
他可以spam整個光譜那語言當然也是

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
你可以跟電腦有語言的

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
溝通或是人跟人之間的語言溝通

757
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
然後其他人在聽對語言也是一個好的

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
研究工具

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
不過語言在神經科學上有一個困難是

760
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
因為你要講話的時候嘴巴要動

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
然後其實這樣對

762
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
量測訊號會有點困難

763
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
那當然這是題外話

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
不過我認為語言也是一個

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
還蠻適合的工具

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
好了解

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
我沒有說音樂是最好只是說他是其中一個

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
然後音樂

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
另一個好處就是說他即便是一個

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
特別的一個活動

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
可是其實在各個文化

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
裡面都有音樂的活動而且人類

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
其實花非常多的

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
資源在進行音樂活動

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
非常多的時間跟資源進行音樂活動

776
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
所以我們認為研究音樂

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
活動其實也可以

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
就是他是反映一個人類很

779
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
很基本的一個行為

780
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
跟一個能力

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
OK

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
所以

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
所以你說音樂是個好的研究工具

784
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
是指說就譬如說

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
你要量測他的腦

786
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
怎麼活動你就是放音樂給他們

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
聽是類似這種研究方法嗎

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
放音樂給他們

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
聽或是讓他們就

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
也讓他們演奏音樂

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
所以就是說你可以有一個

792
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
你可以從最左側的

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
放音樂給他們聽

794
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
你事先設計好這個音樂

795
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
一直到延伸到最右側

796
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
譬如說你可以跟放的音樂互動

797
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
譬如說像唱唱卡拉OK

798
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
或是說沒有音樂在放

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
就是兩個人互相演奏音樂

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
好

801
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
剛剛有問題

802
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
我有一個簡單的問題

803
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
是這樣就是因為這邊講說

804
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
我們可能從這邊開始

805
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
就越來越講越來越多關於音樂

806
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
作為一個研究工具這個事情

807
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
所以我想要clarify一個簡單的問題

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
我們現在討論的是聲音是好的研究工具

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
還是說音樂

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
是一個某種特別有一個明確的

811
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
subset

812
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
在聲音這件事情

813
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
還是我們就要討論聲音是個研究工具

814
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
這樣子

815
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
我會說是音樂

816
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
因為

817
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
如果講聲音

818
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
就是definition而已

819
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
因為聲音的話

820
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
你可以再講一次你的問題嗎

821
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
對

822
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
所以我的問題其實

823
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
你現在說音樂

824
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
是個好研究工具

825
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
那哪些聲音你不會覺得

826
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
你要拿來作為音樂這個定義

827
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
的研究工具

828
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
我懂意思

829
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
對

830
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
我前面忘記講就是說

831
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
其實在傳統研究聽覺上的話

832
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
我們會用電腦合成

833
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
正弦波

834
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
就像你拿起電話

835
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
來聽到的那種聲音

836
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
或是比那個聲音還要粗糙的很多的聲音

837
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
這些東西我都是我們了解

838
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
基本聽覺

839
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
所使用的材料

840
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
可是在一般的情況下

841
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
我們並不會使用那類的材料

842
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
而且

843
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
另外就是說我們在研究聽覺的時候

844
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
常常我們會呈現一個

845
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
完全不變的聲音

846
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
完全一個正弦波比如說呈現它一秒鐘

847
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
可是自然界的情況下

848
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
所有的聲音大概都是出現那一下就不見了

849
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
它不會有同樣的刺激

850
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
重複重複一直延長到一秒鐘

851
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
這麼長

852
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
而且音樂

853
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
它有另外的component

854
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
就是說它有

855
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
比較多的社會互動的component

856
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
它並不是只是說製造聲音

857
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
不是說只是製造出

858
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
我今天就敲一下桌子發出一個聲音

859
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
而是說人家會根據你的聲音

860
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
然後它有response

861
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
然後它做出新的action

862
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
這樣有回答到問題嗎

863
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
有有謝謝

864
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
OK

865
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
OK

866
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
答的問題都非常的好

867
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
那

868
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
在我們這個研究的例子就是說

869
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
我們想要了解用音樂

870
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
演奏當成是一個model的例子

871
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
就是一個社會互動的model

872
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
我們要怎麼樣量測

873
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
量測合作

874
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
然後我們也要了解leader和follow的關係

875
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
然後我們要從什麼方向

876
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
去下手

877
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
去做這個研究

878
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
這個照片是我們實驗室的一個照片

879
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
然後我剛剛找到我們實驗室之前有一個

880
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
短片

881
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
我希望大家聽得到聲音

882
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
有一個兩分半的介紹

883
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
OK

884
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
OK

885
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
OK

886
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
